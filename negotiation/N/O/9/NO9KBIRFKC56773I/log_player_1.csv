Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to maximize my potential profit. Starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Value-based language:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, I emphasize the product's value to Bob. This can make a higher price more palatable.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone suggests I'm open to discussing the price, which can encourage Bob to counter-offer even if he finds the initial price too high. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims for the highest potential profit. However, a very high initial offer might make Bob completely disinterested in negotiation.  It's a calculated risk."
