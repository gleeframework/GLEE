"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my target price. I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This represents a substantial price for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value considering our individual needs. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,
