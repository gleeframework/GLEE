Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, it's always best to try and secure the highest possible price.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a significant profit margin for you (Alice) while still leaving room for Bob to see value in the deal.  
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and a firm price, we aim to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  How Bob responds to this offer will dictate how Alice should proceed with future negotiations."
