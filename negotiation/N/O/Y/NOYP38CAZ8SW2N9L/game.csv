"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer is lower than my initial price, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $9,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,250 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10250.0,Alice,7,
