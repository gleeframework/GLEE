Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can get you to come down in price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning you have other interested buyers (even if you don't yet), you create a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Not Too High:** While starting high, you don't want to alienate Bob completely.  $15,000 is a significant markup but not so outrageous that he'll immediately walk away. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer."
