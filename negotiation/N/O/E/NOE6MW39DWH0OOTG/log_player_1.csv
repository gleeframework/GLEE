Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance Bob might accept a price slightly lower, earning you a profit.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price anchors the negotiation and leaves room for potential adjustments if Bob negotiates.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Since you have John as a backup, you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, you might consider a slightly lower counter-offer, still aiming for a price higher than your guaranteed sale price to John."
