"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll get.  Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
