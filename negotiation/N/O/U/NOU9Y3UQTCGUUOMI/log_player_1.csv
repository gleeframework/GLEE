Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. It's a great deal for something of such high quality."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

Reasoning:

Since I know Bob values the product at $100, I want to start with a price significantly higher than his valuation, but not so high that it seems completely unreasonable. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  If Bob accepts, I make a tidy profit. If he rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
