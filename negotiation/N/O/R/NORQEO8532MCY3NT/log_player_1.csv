"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm starting with a price of $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I want to maintain a friendly and positive atmosphere to encourage Bob to stay engaged.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This offer is high enough that I expect Bob to counter, allowing us to negotiate further.
* **Understanding Bob's value:**  I'm aware that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price that is within his range but still benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but my budget is quite tight. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can negotiate a better price.
* **Value of John's offer:** While John's offer of $10,000 is attractive, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still lower than my initial offer. This will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrate the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Given the value of this product,  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that $8,500 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly to encourage further negotiation.

**Goal:**

My goal is to get Bob closer to my minimum price while still maintaining a positive negotiation. I expect him to counteroffer again, but I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I am still unable to meet you at $8,500. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $8,000 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation room:** Bob is consistently refusing to budge from his original offer of $8,000, which is significantly below my minimum price. 
* **Risk of losing time:**  We're already in round 4, and I have only 6 rounds left to close the deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste valuable time.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed profit and meets my minimum requirement. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price,  it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to negotiate further.  Selling to John ensures a secure transaction and a good return on the product."
