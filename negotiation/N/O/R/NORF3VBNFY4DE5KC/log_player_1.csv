"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it's still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to consider the offer. 

I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000.  If the negotiations with Bob stall, I can always choose to walk away and secure that guaranteed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  There's still a chance that Bob will increase his offer, and I'm also keeping in mind that selling to John for $15,000 remains an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting a better price, but it's still lower than my minimum value, leaving room for further negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to consider a price closer to what I'm hoping for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a better price.  While selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, I'm determined to get as close to that amount as possible through negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again raising the price, but only slightly. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. The goal is to find a middle ground where we can both agree. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not close enough to what I'd like to achieve.  At this point, with only a few rounds left, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John. The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high, as I might end up with a lower price or no deal at all.  It's time to be practical and secure the best possible outcome for myself."
