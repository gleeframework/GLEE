{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping to get closer to the $15,000 value for him, but I'm willing to settle for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to settle for that.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $11,500? This still offers you a significant savings over your initial assessment and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 11500}
