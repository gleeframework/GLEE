"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $11,500? This still offers you a significant savings over your initial assessment and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",11500.0,Alice,3,
