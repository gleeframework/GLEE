"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested, but I'm going to have to come in a bit lower.  How about we start with $850,000?  I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a lower price.  How about $860,000? This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and it's still within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $860,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $880,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
