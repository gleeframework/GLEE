Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $860,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $880,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a lower price.  It's important to remember that I can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so accepting this offer is a better deal."
