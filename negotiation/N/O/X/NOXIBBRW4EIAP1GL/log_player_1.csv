Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
While $800,000 is still a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  The product is truly exceptional, and I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price considering its value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. That seems like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made on the price.  How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."
