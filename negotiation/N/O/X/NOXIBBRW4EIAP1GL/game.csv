"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  The product is truly exceptional, and I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price considering its value. Let's try to find some common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. That seems like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's find a sweet spot. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial limitations.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made on the price.  How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
