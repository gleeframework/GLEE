"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $10,500 is the absolute highest I can go. If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready.  Otherwise, I think I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
