Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still ensuring you get a good price.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $99 is a common psychological pricing tactic, making it seem more appealing than a flat $100. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still being appealing enough to avoid going to your backup buyer."
