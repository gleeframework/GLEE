Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $120, which is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum value of $120.  I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm making a counteroffer at $115, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my minimum value."
