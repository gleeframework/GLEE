"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your initial offer, but  $2,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
