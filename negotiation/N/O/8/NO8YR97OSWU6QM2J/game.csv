,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,85.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $70. I can do $85, which is a bit closer to my minimum price, but still a great value for you. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and meet at $77.5?",77.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,82.5
"Hi Bob, I like your thinking on the compromise, but I'm not sure I can meet you exactly at $77.5. How about we meet in the middle of my last offer and your new offer, which would be $81.25? It's a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think you'll really like the product at that price.",81.25,Alice,5,,
