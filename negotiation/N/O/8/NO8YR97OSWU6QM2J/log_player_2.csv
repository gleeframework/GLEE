Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $70. I can do $85, which is a bit closer to my minimum price, but still a great value for you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like your thinking on the compromise, but I'm not sure I can meet you exactly at $77.5. How about we meet in the middle of my last offer and your new offer, which would be $81.25? It's a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think you'll really like the product at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but also showing some resistance to going much lower.  While we might be able to get the price down a little more, the difference is becoming increasingly small, and we risk Alice becoming frustrated and ending the negotiation.  $81.25 is a reasonable compromise and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer."
