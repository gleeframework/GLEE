"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $7,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to get the best possible price. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to a deal.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get the best possible price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,900. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you.",6900.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $6,900 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a little hesitant.  I'm willing to go to $6,700.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.",6700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're being firm with your offer, and I respect that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,700. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $6,850. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",6850.0,Alice,5,
