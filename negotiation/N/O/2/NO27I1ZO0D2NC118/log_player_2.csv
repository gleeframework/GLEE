# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, he can potentially get a better price by negotiating further. There's room for Alice to lower the price since she values the product at $1,200,000 and is willing to sell for $1,100,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $1,075,000, he's getting a better price than from John, and he's saved $25,000 compared to Alice's initial offer.  Further negotiation might get him a lower price, but there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer, and he might end up paying more than $1,075,000.  It's a good compromise and a reasonable price."
