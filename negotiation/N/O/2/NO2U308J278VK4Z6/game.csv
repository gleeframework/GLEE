"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12000 for the product. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11500. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to come down to $11000? I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I might need to consider other offers. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I was thinking we could do $11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
