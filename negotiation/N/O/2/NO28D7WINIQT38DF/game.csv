"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. This product truly has the potential to be a game-changer, and its value is reflected in my pricing. While I can't go as low as $1,800,000, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, considering the product's exceptional qualities.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
