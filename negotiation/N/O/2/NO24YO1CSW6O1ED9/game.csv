"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for both of us to gain. Let's find a middle ground that works for us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking of a price more around $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $980,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this deal done.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",990000.0,Bob,6,
