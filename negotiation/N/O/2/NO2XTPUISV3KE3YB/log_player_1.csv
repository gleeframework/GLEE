Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This allows you to potentially make a profit while still leaving room for counteroffers.

I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll always have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a good price for both of us. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it's still a good deal for Bob compared to his initial offer. I hope this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low. I've reached my limit and John offers a much more favorable price. I'll sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
