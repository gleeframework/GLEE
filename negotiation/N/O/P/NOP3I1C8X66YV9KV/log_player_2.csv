{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's always worth trying to get a better deal. We have 10 rounds, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and will likely prompt Alice to reconsider. It's important to be aggressive early on to establish a strong negotiating position."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, we're still within the negotiation zone. There's no need to rush into a deal, especially since we have many rounds left.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows us to potentially secure an even better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved a bit, but we're still not there yet. This counteroffer is a slight increase from our previous offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly, and we're now very close to our target price. Accepting this offer ensures we get a good deal without risking losing the product. With 5 rounds remaining, there's no guarantee we'll get a lower price, and we're already saving a substantial amount compared to John's offer."
