"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation. I believe Bob will find the product valuable enough to at least consider my offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I've mentioned the product's value to Bob to emphasize its worth and justify my asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've made it clear I'm open to negotiation by asking for his thoughts.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially considering Bob's initial interest.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. It signals that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Assessing Bob's Willingness:**  I want to see how determined Bob is to acquire the product. His counteroffer will reveal if he's willing to come closer to my asking price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll carefully consider the risk of losing the deal to Bob, but I'm confident I can secure a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've made a significant compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to work towards an agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Positive Framing:** I've emphasized the ""mutually beneficial outcome"" to encourage Bob to see the deal as a win-win situation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. I'm prepared to make further adjustments depending on his response, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a significant concession from my initial price and a good deal for both of us.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in Round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, continuing to negotiate could be risky. There's no guarantee that I'll be able to secure a higher price with additional rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John at $1,000,000 is too high.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. I've successfully negotiated a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
