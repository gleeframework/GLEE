"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still more than your maximum value ($120), so rejecting the offer is the best initial move. This allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's asking price of $110 and my maximum value of $120. This shows good faith in wanting to make a deal, but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $109 is closer to my value, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $107,  which is  a further reduction from my previous counteroffer.  This continues to show that I'm willing to negotiate but still need to stay within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $108, which is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer saves me $2 compared to buying from John, and secures the product.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy at a higher price from John outweighs the potential for a few more dollars in savings."
