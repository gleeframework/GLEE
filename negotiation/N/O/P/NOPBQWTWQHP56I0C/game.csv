"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe $11,500 is still too high for me. I would like to stick to my original offer of $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle again at $10,750? It's a small step up from your offer and a significant step down from my last one.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $10,600. This is a small adjustment from your offer, and it would allow me to make this deal work. What do you say?",10600.0,Alice,7,
