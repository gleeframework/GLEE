"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of $175. How about we try $155? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to stay within my budget.",155.0,Bob,4,
