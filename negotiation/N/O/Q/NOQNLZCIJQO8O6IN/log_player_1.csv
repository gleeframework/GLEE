""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum. This empowers you to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is phrased to encourage dialogue and gauge Bob's interest level."
