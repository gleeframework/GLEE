"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can you consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $95? I'm really interested in your product and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really hoping we can close this deal. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",102.5,Alice,7,
