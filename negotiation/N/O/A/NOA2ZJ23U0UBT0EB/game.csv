,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering we're both looking to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,150,000 doesn't reflect that. My final offer is $1,180,000. This is the lowest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the deal.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
