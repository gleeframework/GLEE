"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.  I believe it's a reasonable starting point, especially since I have no information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. $7,500 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,500. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price. I can choose to continue negotiating with Bob, but there's no guarantee that he will increase his offer. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice at this point, as it allows me to sell the product for my minimum acceptable price."
