# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $950,000 is a significant sum, I believe the true value of this product is even higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I think this price reflects the value it will bring to your business while still being a fair deal for both of us.
