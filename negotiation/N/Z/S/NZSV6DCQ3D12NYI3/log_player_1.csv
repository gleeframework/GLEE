Send your offer to Bob.,"I'm excited to make an offer to Bob!

Here's my initial offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $8,500. Since this is lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'll choose to reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""product_price"": 11,000}
