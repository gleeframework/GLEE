"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $140 is closer, but I'm still a little ways off. How about we settle on $155?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider that?,145.0,Bob,6,
