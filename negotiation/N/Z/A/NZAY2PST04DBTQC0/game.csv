"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. ",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
