Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
