Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and accepting would be a substantial loss. While his counter is a starting point, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While the product is good, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider something closer to $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is slowly moving in the right direction, but still significantly below my minimum. I need to decide if I think I can negotiate him up in the remaining time, or if the guaranteed $15,000 from John is the safer play.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $11,500 is too far from where I need to be. If this product is going to work for you, I need to see at least $14,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
