"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its potential benefits."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I'm still hesitant at $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me. I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is steadily increasing his offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than both our desired price and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle.  To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and importance. This could encourage Bob to agree to a price closer to our target while still leaving us room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value your persistence and willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to go to $975,000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial position.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we stated our previous offer was our ""final offer"" as a negotiation tactic, Bob's offer of $975,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and is reasonably close to our $1,000,000 target. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further stalling the negotiation, which could lead to missing out on both offers."
