"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like! It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should try to negotiate a better price with Alice or go with John's offer."
