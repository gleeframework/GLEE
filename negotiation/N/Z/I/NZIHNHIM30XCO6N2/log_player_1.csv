Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point to ensure I get a price that is closer to what the product is worth to me. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price closer to what the product is worth to me.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting close to my minimum value and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
