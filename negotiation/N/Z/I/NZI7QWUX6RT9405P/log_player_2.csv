"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is significantly above her own valuation of the product.  There's a good chance we can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its actual worth."",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. By anchoring our offer closer to Alice's valuation ($10,000) we increase the chances of reaching a deal that's more favorable for us. We also provide a justification for our offer to make it appear more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250? That still gives you a good deal considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has moved closer to our desired price range, we're still aiming to pay closer to $11,000. There's no need to rush, we have several rounds left and can try to nudge the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can offer you $11,500 for the product. That's a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal."",
 ""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're making a smaller concession in this round, signaling to Alice that we're serious about the $11,000 range but willing to compromise slightly. By expressing our desire to close the deal and emphasizing a ""fair price"" we aim to keep the negotiation moving forward."
