"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $18,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this brings.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept $16,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth.",16000.0,Alice,5,
