"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can offer you a price of $775000. What are your thoughts?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $775000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $725000. This feels like a fair price given our previous discussions, and I'm confident it would be mutually beneficial.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a good price, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $750000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",750000.0,Alice,5,
