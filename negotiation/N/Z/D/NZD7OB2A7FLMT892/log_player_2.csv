Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. Would that work for you?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I see where you're coming from, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $7,000. Perhaps we can settle on $8,750? This keeps us close to our previous middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. How about we split the difference one last time and call it $8,125?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000, and even at $8,125, you're spending more than you need to. John offers a sure thing at your target price."
