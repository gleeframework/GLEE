Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth $15,000, it hints at additional value by mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open and invites Bob to share his thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, moving closer to her minimum of $10,000. Having John as a backup buyer gives Alice leverage in this negotiation."
