Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm valuing it at $20,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we want to start negotiations significantly higher to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $20,000 price provides a cushion for potential negotiation while still remaining above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification for price:** By highlighting the ""unique value"" of the product, we provide a reason for the high price without explicitly revealing our bottom line.

**Important Note:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  If Bob outright rejects the $20,000, Alice can gradually lower the price (staying above $15,000) to find a potential agreement point before going with John."
