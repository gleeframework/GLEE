"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and optimism without revealing my bottom line.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob's input, signaling a willingness to negotiate while gauging his initial reaction.

I'm starting high, but I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the coming rounds. I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant move, it's still below my $2,200,000 starting point and considerably lower than my $1,500,000 minimum.  There's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I have John as a reliable backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product and its potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession of $200,000 to show Bob I'm serious about finding a deal.  
* **Holding Ground:** I'm still well above Bob's offer and haven't dipped below my $2,000,000 mark.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob of the benefits it offers.

This counteroffer balances my willingness to negotiate with my goal of maximizing profit. I'm eager to see Bob's response and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I still have some negotiating power, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a better deal.  I'll make one more strategic counteroffer before considering accepting his price or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we both value this product and want to make a deal happen. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last price. This adds a sense of urgency and shows Bob I'm serious.
* **Meeting Halfway:** By splitting the difference between his previous offer ($1,600,000) and mine ($2,000,000), it seems like a reasonable compromise.
* **Above Minimum:** This price still gives me a comfortable profit margin above my $1,500,000 minimum.

This offer aims for a win-win. If Bob accepts, I've secured a great price. If he rejects it, I'm comfortable walking away and taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,600,000, and he's explicitly stated his budget constraints.  It's unlikely he'll move significantly higher. While I could continue negotiating, I'm choosing to cut my losses. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a strong deal. 

It's better to secure a good sale now than risk a lower offer from Bob in later rounds or waste more time negotiating."
