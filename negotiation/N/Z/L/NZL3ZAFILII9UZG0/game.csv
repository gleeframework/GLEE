"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and it's worth $15,000  considering the value it offers. How about we start the negotiation at $14,000? ",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. This product is truly valuable, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its worth.  Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,500, which is $11,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to go as low as $9,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
