"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $975,000 is still significantly below what I'm looking for.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $990,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
