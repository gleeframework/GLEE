{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? I'm willing to consider offers up to $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already lowered my price to my minimum, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm better off selling to John for $150 and avoiding further negotiation with Bob."
