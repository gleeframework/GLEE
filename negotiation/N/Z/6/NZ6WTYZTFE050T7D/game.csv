"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $16000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet in the middle at $17000? This would still allow you to get a good price and give me a fair return on my product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
