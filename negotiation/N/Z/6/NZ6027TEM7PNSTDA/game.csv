"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree your product is excellent, the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,200 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
