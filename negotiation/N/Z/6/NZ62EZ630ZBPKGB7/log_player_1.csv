Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth. I will try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but it's a bit lower than what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can move forward from there."", ""product_price"": 825000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'll try to push for a higher offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and with only four rounds left, I don't have the time to continue negotiating. I'm comfortable selling to John for $800,000, which is my minimum price and ensures I don't lose out on a significant profit."
