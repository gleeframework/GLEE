Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1100000. This allows for a fair profit for both of us. What do you say?

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
