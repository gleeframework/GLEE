"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $75. How about we aim for $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've been considering other options, and to be honest,  $80 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works for you, I'm ready to buy right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to have to counteroffer again. How about we meet at $95? It's still a bit higher than your maximum, but I'm willing to compromise.",95.0,Alice,7,
