"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially setting the price at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This leaves room for concessions and signals the product's high value to you. 
* **Anchoring:** The initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's high, it makes subsequent offers in the $1.5 million to $2 million range seem more reasonable. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and potential budget. His response will give you valuable information for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, the price point is quite high for me. I'm interested in exploring this further, but I'd need to see a significant adjustment to consider purchasing. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below what you're willing to accept. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Accepting such a low offer early on puts you at a disadvantage for the rest of the negotiation.
* **Continue Steering the Price:** You can now make a counteroffer that brings the price closer to your desired range without drastically dropping from your initial offer. 
* **Signal Your Bottom Line:** By rejecting this offer, you communicate to Bob that you're serious about getting a fair price and won't settle for a lowball offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, considering the substantial value you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a significant concession from your initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Staying Above the Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps you well above your $1,500,000 minimum and provides room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** You're reiterating the product's value to justify the high price. This helps prevent Bob from anchoring too heavily on his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic price.  Would you consider $800,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to acquire the product while reflecting its true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own stated value for the product.  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you.  It's clear that Bob is trying to negotiate a heavily discounted price, but you have a strong alternative with John. 

It's time to:

* **Stand Firm:** Rejecting this low offer firmly communicates that you won't accept a price that undervalues the product.
* **Reiterate Value:**  In your next counteroffer, re-emphasize the product's worth and why your price is justified.
* **Consider John:**  While you're still negotiating with Bob, be prepared to walk away from the deal if his offers don't improve significantly. John's guaranteed offer is looking more and more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I must be candid. Your current offer significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to continue this conversation, but only if we can find a price point that reflects the true value of what's being offered.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're being firm by stating that his offer is unacceptable, but also signaling that you're still open to negotiation by presenting a new offer.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is your final offer, you're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to take your offer more seriously.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While this offer is a concession, it's still significantly above your minimum and closer to Bob's initial valuation of the product.  
* **Preparing for Alternatives:** This strong stance prepares you to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't meet you closer to your price expectations. You have a strong alternative with John."
