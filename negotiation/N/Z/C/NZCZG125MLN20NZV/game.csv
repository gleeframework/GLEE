"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, the price point is quite high for me. I'm interested in exploring this further, but I'd need to see a significant adjustment to consider purchasing. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price.

"Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic price.  Would you consider $800,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to acquire the product while reflecting its true value to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I must be candid. Your current offer significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to continue this conversation, but only if we can find a price point that reflects the true value of what's being offered.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
