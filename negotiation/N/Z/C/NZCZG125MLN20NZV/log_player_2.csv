Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price.

Alice is coming down, but she's still way above your budget and John's offer. It's time to push back a bit more firmly and see if she's serious about negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the revised offer, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic price.  Would you consider $800,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to acquire the product while reflecting its true value to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I must be candid. Your current offer significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to continue this conversation, but only if we can find a price point that reflects the true value of what's being offered.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is barely budging and has declared a ""final offer.""  She seems unlikely to come down to a price you'd find acceptable. It's time to cut your losses and take John's offer, saving yourself a significant amount of money."
