Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $150 to him. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* This strategy aims to quickly get a good price while leaving room to adjust if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay up to $100 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110** is a compromise, offering Bob a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than his counteroffer.  
* The message is friendly and acknowledges Bob's position while reiterating my desire for a fair price.
* This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without having to involve John."
