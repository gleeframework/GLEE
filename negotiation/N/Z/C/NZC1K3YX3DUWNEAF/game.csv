,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value it brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
