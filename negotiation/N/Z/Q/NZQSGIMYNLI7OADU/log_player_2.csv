# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers exceptional value, and this is a competitive price.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target and potentially get a better deal."
