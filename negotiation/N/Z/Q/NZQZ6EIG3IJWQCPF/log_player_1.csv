Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point as it's a good distance above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as much as possible from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and avoids further negotiation."
