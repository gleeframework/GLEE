"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's worth even more to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $10,100.  That's a fair compromise that still gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,5,
