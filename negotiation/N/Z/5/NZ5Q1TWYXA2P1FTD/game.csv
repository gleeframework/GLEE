"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10500 for the product. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11500 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11250 for the product. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to get the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, but I need to get a slight premium for it. I'm thinking of $11750. Can you consider that?",11750.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to the limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11750. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000 for this product. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Alice,9,
