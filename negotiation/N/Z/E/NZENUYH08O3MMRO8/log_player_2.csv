"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to my valuation. I'm willing to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a low counteroffer ($6,000) sets a negotiation anchor, potentially influencing Alice to make more significant concessions. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer leaves space for back-and-forth negotiation while still being significantly below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a polite and interested tone is essential for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and I risk losing the deal. Accepting now secures the product at the best price I'm likely to get."
