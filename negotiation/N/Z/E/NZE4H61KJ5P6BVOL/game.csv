"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9500. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's the closest I can go at this point. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to look at other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to go down to $9000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers again. How about $8750?",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. I'm firm on $9000. If you're not willing to go any higher, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,7,
