Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $9,500 is above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's potential for him to accept a price lower than that. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By starting high, you demonstrate you value the product and are not desperate to sell. 

This strategy allows you to potentially gain a higher price without risking a complete breakdown of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's current offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to close the deal.  I believe $9,250 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will accept."
