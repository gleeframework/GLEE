"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the significant value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
