{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a round number which makes it easier to discuss.  I'm eager to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is more than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is only slightly above my minimum, it's still a decent deal. I'm not sure I can get much better with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing him altogether."
