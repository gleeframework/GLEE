"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  This offer still gives you a significant advantage, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. While I value your interest, $875,000 simply doesn't make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows you a substantial return on your investment, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the results. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
