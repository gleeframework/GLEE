Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $850,000 is still too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth much more to Bob.  I have 9 more rounds to work with, and I'm not giving up on getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  This offer still gives you a significant advantage, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better.  I have 6 more rounds left, and I'm confident I can reach a deal that's more advantageous for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. While I value your interest, $875,000 simply doesn't make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows you a substantial return on your investment, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the results. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I really appreciate the effort to reach an agreement. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $885,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision.  Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I at least get my minimum acceptable price."
