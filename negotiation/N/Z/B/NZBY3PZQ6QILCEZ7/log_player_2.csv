"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. While it's tempting to accept, it's always worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price.  There's no downside to rejecting and making a counteroffer. You might be able to save some money."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is at the very top of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,000,000? I believe this is still a fair price for a unique product like this and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount and brings the price closer to my preferred range.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible and ultimately I'll be forced to pay John's price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price within my budget."
