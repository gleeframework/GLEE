# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's not worth accepting.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You can likely negotiate a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
