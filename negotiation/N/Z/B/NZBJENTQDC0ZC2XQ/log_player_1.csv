Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""worth"" and ""potential,"" aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Alternative:**  I'm aware I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, which acts as my safety net. I won't settle for anything less.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while staying aware of Bob's potential counter-offers and my alternative sale option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and willing to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet my needs. I'll use the next round to present a counteroffer that moves towards a more mutually beneficial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we consider $1,100,000?  I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, but Above Minimum:**  I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, the new price remains well above both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's initial offer ($600,000).
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's high value to justify the price difference and avoid appearing overly eager to lower it.
* **Guaging Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's true interest. If he's unwilling to budge significantly from his low initial offer, it might be more beneficial to walk away and pursue the guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,100,000 is still much higher than I'd be willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my initial price, his offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum. Further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge this gap.  

Crucially, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It makes more financial sense to accept the guaranteed sale rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might not result in a satisfactory outcome."
