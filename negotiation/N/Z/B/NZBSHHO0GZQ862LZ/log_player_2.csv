# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussion. What are your thoughts?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Since you can secure the product for $800,000 from John, it's more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further or buy from John."
