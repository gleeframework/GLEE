"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price given its value. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm  firmly at $850,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
