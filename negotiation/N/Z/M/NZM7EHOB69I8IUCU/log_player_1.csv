"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I can still do better.** I'm willing to negotiate further in hopes of getting closer to my desired price of $100. 
* **There are still rounds left.**  I want to avoid selling to John for $80 if I can. I'll try to reach a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $95? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not too much. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value (""I believe this is a fair price..."") to encourage him to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $95, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise, right in the middle of my last offer ($95) and his previous offer ($85).
* **Close to my goal:**  $90 is significantly closer to my desired price of $100 than John's offer of $80.
* **Time is a factor:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to avoid the risk of further negotiation back and forth and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
