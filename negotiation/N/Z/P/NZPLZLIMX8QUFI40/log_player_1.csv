Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product with immense value. My initial price is $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford $1800000. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I need to counteroffer to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is far below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but I can't go any lower. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1400000 is still outside of my budget.  I can offer you $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again.  There are still several rounds left to negotiate, and I don't want to settle too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still not a price I can accept. The product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product to you, but $1200000 is still a stretch for me.  I can go up to $1100000.  This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I don't want to risk him rejecting my next counteroffer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's better to close the deal than to keep negotiating with Bob."
