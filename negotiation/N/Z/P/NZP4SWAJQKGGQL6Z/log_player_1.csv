Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $110 or $112 is still better than selling to John for $100."
