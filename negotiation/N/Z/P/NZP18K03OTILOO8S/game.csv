"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $102.50?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $102.50, which would be $96.25. Can you consider that?",96.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $96.25 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle one more time.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell you the product without having to go through John.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to go up to $98, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,6,
