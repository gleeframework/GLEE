"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Could we settle on something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $700,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, while also allowing me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  Consider this my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle somewhat. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $750,000. This offer is a serious price jump on my side and reflects my strong interest in the product. Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
