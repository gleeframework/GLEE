Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is valuable to Bob, Alice is subtly anchoring her price to his perceived value rather than her own minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the offer is significantly higher than John's offer, it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob accepting. If Bob really values the product, he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
