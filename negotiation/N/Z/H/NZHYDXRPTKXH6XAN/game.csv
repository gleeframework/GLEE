"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the value this product holds. To reflect both our needs, I'm willing to lower my price to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  While I'm willing to compromise, $11,000 simply doesn't reflect the real value of this product.  To show my willingness to reach a deal, I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  This is a fair price, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  To make a final attempt at a deal, I'm willing to drop to $11,200.  This price recognizes your needs while still reflecting the product's worth.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.  Let me know your thoughts.",11200.0,Alice,7,
