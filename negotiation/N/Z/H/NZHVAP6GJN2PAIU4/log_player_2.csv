{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to Bob's ideal price, but it's still above it.  Bob has reached a point where he's comfortable with the price John is offering.  There's a high risk that continuing to negotiate with Alice might result in a deal at a higher price, or no deal at all. It's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product at the guaranteed price from John."
