"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1800000 is a fair offer, I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I truly believe in the value of this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1700000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1850000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.  What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
