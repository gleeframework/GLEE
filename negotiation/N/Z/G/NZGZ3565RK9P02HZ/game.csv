"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking to get at least $150 for it.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're looking for $150, but that's a bit out of my range.  I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $80 right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize it.",110.0,Alice,5,
