"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what the product is worth to me. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I'm hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell at that price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal.  There's still a significant gap between our valuations, and I have more rounds to try to bridge it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate that.  $950,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the significant value of the product, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm offering $1,000,000.  This is a reasonable price given my budget and the value of the product.  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. It's getting very close to my minimum, but I'm confident that I can get a better deal with more negotiation.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to meet you halfway on this one. I'll accept $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price given the value of the product and our current positions.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can reach a figure closer to $1,000,000.  I'm offering $1,025,000. This shows my commitment to closing the deal and feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of time.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal from Bob is too high.  I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I'm willing to accept his offer to ensure a good outcome."
