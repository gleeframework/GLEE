"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can reach a figure closer to $1,000,000.  I'm offering $1,025,000. This shows my commitment to closing the deal and feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
