"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for your product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000? It's still a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose $10,500 for your product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise that benefits us both.  I'm also starting to feel pressured by the time constraint, so I'll need to be firm in my negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,800, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, you need to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 10800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering our conversation and I'd like to propose $10,700 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our needs. I hope you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I'm also running the risk of John changing his mind, so it's better to secure the sale now."
