Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than the asking price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, $900,000 is far below my minimum threshold. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe we can reach a more advantageous price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 yet, and I think Bob might be willing to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I value our negotiation, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $1,025,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you moving towards my price point. To be honest, I have another offer on the table, but I'd prefer to work with you. Would you be willing to do $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is $1,000,000, which is my minimum threshold. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit, while rejecting it risks losing the deal and only getting $1,000,000 from John. It's a good time to close the deal."
