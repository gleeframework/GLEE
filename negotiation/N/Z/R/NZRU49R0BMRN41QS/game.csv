"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than the asking price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value our negotiation, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $1,025,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you moving towards my price point. To be honest, I have another offer on the table, but I'd prefer to work with you. Would you be willing to do $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
