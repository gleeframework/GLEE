"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm offering it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you like it. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is my absolute minimum price. I'm confident that this is a fair deal, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $10000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're really interested in the product, I think this is a fair deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
