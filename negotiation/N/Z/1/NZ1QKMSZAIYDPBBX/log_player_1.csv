Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a 20% markup over the minimum I'm willing to accept, and leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, this offer is still potentially appealing to him.  

I will keep in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a good price, it's below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob seems insistent on staying below $1,000,000.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
