Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 (her product's value to her).
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 from John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price, there's no incentive to offer a price lower than John's offer to Bob.  Alice should aim for the highest price Bob might accept, knowing she has a backup plan.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and positions the product's value.
* **Targeting Bob's Maximum:** The offer is at the highest price Bob might consider.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** While Bob can still try to negotiate, Alice is starting at a strong point knowing she has John as a backup. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, Alice maximizes her potential gain by starting high and knowing she has a guaranteed sale at her minimum price."
