Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $875,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000 and a better deal than selling to John for $800,000.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
