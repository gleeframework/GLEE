Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, and my minimum is $12,000, I want to start with a higher offer to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level. His response will give me insight into how much he's willing to pay.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" (referring to John), I subtly introduce the concept of scarcity and competition, potentially motivating Bob to consider the offer more seriously. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while leaving room to negotiate a price that works for both of us, if possible. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can gradually lower it (but not below $12,000) or proceed with selling to John."
