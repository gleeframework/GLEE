"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'd like to make you a one-time offer of $1,000,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to resist. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Bob can get the same product from John for $800,000, which aligns with his budget and maximizes his savings."
