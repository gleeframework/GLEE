"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $9,000. It's ambitious, but Bob might be willing to negotiate a bit. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500. It's a bit closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this is a more agreeable price for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's getting too low for my liking.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a compromise, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000. I'll try to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $8,200. It's a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I hope this is enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower and I'm starting to feel like we're far apart. I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000, and I'm concerned that we're wasting time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
