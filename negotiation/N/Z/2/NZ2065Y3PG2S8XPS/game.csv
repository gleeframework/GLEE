"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",145.0,Alice,5,
