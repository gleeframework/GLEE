"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. This offer reflects the asset's true worth and future potential."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" the message subtly justifies the high price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:** The message implies willingness to negotiate by stating it's a ""starting price"" and an ""offer."" 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Establish a high initial price in Bob's mind.
2. **Gauge:** Observe Bob's reaction to understand his willingness to pay. 
3. **Negotiate:** Leave space for a back-and-forth discussion to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much. I could offer you $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to explore if you can negotiate a better deal.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price and are willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. This sets the stage for a more balanced negotiation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential impact.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this revised offer reflects a more accurate value and presents a fair opportunity for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  The message starts by recognizing Bob's offer and perspective. This shows you're actively listening and trying to find common ground.
* **Standing Firm:** While you're making a significant price reduction ($200,000), you're still firmly above both your minimum and Bob's stated value. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  By reiterating the ""value and potential,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the benefits he'd gain.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The phrase ""middle ground"" emphasizes your willingness to negotiate and encourages Bob to do the same.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Value:** Avoid a drastic price drop that could signal desperation.
* **Encourage Movement:**  Prompt Bob to raise his offer significantly in the next round.
* **Keep Negotiating:** Show you're serious about reaching a deal but not at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. How about $950,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows how serious I am. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. You have several factors to consider:

* **Negotiating Position:**  You're past the halfway point in the rounds. While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his increments are relatively small.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price. This provides you with a strong fallback position.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's latest message indicates he's serious, potentially leaving room for further negotiation.

Rejecting this offer maintains pressure on Bob to increase his price significantly if he wants to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the product's value. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,200,000 from another interested buyer. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I'm confident this product can be more beneficial to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:**  By revealing John's offer, you create a sense of urgency and demonstrate the product's value to other potential buyers.
* **Limited Flexibility:**  Stating it's your ""final offer"" signals you're firm on the price and unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Focus on Value:**  Shifting the focus back to the benefits Bob would gain aims to justify the price and sway his decision. 
* **Strategic Concession:** The relatively small price reduction ($100,000) shows you're trying to close the deal while still staying above your minimum.

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage a Quick Decision:** Bob now knows he needs to act fast if he wants the product.
2. **Justify the Price:**  The existence of another offer at a higher price supports your valuation. 
3. **Maintain Profitability:**  The final offer ensures you achieve a price above your minimum if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,300,000 is really pushing my limit.  If this deal is going to work, we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's my absolute best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. Here's why:

* **Unlikely to Reach Your Price:** Bob is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).  His incremental increases and the statement that it's his ""absolute best offer"" suggest he's unlikely to meet your valuation.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John represents a certain deal at your desired price. Accepting Bob's offer means a loss of $150,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of Bob not increasing his offer substantially outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. 

While you could counter-offer again, it's a risky gamble.  Selling to John secures your profit and avoids potentially wasting more time and effort on an uncertain negotiation."
