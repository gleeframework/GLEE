"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, given its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $70? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $70 is still quite low for what I can offer it for elsewhere. I'm willing to come down slightly to $85, my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $82.50? I'm trying to find a compromise here.",82.5,Bob,6,
