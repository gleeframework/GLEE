It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially when you have a fixed maximum price. Since Alice's initial offer is at your maximum, there's room for potential savings.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm going to start with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This gives Alice room to counter if she's willing to negotiate, but it also shows I'm serious about getting a good deal."

While $11,000 is closer to my goal, it's still worth trying to push for a lower price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to budge further."

Alice has come down significantly.  I'm going to accept this offer. While I'd love to get it lower, $10,900 is a good price and getting closer to my goal. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal by pushing for a lower price."
