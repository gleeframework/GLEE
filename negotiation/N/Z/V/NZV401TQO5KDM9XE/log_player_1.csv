Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $150, but let me know if you're interested and we might be able to work something out."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's very interested, he might be willing to pay close to the asking price. If he balks, there's room to lower the price slightly.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has the safety net of John who will buy the product for $100. This allows Alice to be firmer in her negotiation with Bob."
