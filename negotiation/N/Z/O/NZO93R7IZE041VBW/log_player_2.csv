Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is better than her initial $18,000, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $15,500 is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I'm going to continue negotiating, but I'm also getting closer to the point where I might consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is my final offer. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,200. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,200 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring that I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiations that may not lead to a successful outcome."
