"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I can offer $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
