Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my absolute lowest price. This product is truly unique and will give you a significant competitive edge. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $812,500? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I appreciate your commitment to making this deal work.  However,  $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum requirement. To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This allows for a fair profit for me while still giving you a valuable asset.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is not budging from her high offers. She went back up to $1,000,000 which is a bad sign.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 than risk not getting the product at all or overpaying with Alice."
