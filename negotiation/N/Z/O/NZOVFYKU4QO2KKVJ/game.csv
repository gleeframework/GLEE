"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my absolute lowest price. This product is truly unique and will give you a significant competitive edge. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings to both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $812,500? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $812,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer. This allows me to gain value from the product while ensuring a fair deal for you. Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I appreciate your commitment to making this deal work.  However,  $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum requirement. To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This allows for a fair profit for me while still giving you a valuable asset.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
