{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more amicable negotiation process. 

Remember,  you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum, and you have a guaranteed sale to John for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round allows you to explore if you can reach a compromise with Bob without risking selling for less than your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
