Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always come down to a price closer to $80. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing the sale entirely. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
