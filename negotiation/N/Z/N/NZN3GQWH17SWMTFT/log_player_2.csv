"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price from Alice. I can counteroffer with a lower price, hoping to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000.  While I'd love to get it lower, I'm already saving $150,000 compared to John's price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
