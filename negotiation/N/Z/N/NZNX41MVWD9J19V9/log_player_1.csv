Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $14,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good compromise, and it's more than I'd get from John. I'm happy to accept."
