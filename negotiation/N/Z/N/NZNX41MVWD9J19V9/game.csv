"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $14,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
