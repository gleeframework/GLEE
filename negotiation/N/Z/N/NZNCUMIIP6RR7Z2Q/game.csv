"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product,  $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a little too high for me. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $100? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it!",100.0,Alice,5,
