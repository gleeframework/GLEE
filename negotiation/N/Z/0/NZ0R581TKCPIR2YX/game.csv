"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $10000 is the highest I can go. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. If you're willing to sell it to me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I think $8000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9500. If you're willing to sell it to me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
