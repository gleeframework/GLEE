Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's more than what you'd get from John, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.  

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **High enough for profit:**  $1,150,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Low enough for appeal:**  $1,150,000 is still a good deal for Bob, since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, and you have some wiggle room to work with. 

Let's see if Bob takes the offer!"
