You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $1,200,000 which is within my budget, and it's a better deal than Alice's offer.
