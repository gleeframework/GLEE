"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits and potential this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,030,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1030000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire to find a mutually agreeable price. While I'm committed to making this work, I can't go as low as $950,000. Let's settle this at $1,000,000. It's a strong offer for a product of this caliber.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
