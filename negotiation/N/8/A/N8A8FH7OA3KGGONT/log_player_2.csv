{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While $78 is closer to your target, you still have 3 rounds left. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to lower her price even further.  It's possible she's feeling the pressure as the time runs out and is willing to make a final concession."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 72}
```

You're increasing your offer to $72. This shows Alice you're serious about a deal, but you're still pushing for a price closer to your target.  You have only two rounds left, so this might be your last chance to get a lower price from Alice."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but with only one round left, it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice to drop her price to your target. It's better to go with John's offer and guarantee you get the product for your maximum price.  You still save some money compared to Alice's initial price, and you avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your final counteroffer."
