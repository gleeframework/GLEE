{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a price of $90. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. It also doesn't immediately make him feel like he's getting a bad deal.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is more than my minimum of $80, it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $85 for you.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm sticking to my guns a bit with this counteroffer. $85 is still above my minimum and reflects the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal, especially since he rejected my initial offer. Let's see if this gets us closer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $80 is the most I'm willing to pay. I'm trying to be fair, but I also want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one! Bob's offer is exactly my minimum value, and I could sell to John for that amount right now. However, I've already invested some time in negotiating with Bob, and there's a chance I could lose out on a sale completely if I reject this offer.  It's a risk, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
