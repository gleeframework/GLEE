Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of your product, $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000,  which reflects the value I see in this product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

In light of that, I would like to propose a more flexible deal. How about we consider a payment plan over 12 months?
