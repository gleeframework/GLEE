Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob. This strategy aims to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to pay a higher price than his perceived value.
* **Create negotiation room:**  By offering a lower price, you leave room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially reaching a middle ground.
* **Secure a backup:**  If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

This offer allows you to maintain some leverage while exploring a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than the price you initially offered.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price.  

You have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, but rejecting Bob's offer allows you to explore if you can get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer to Bob is still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it is a significant increase from Bob's offer of $800,000.  This counteroffer:

* **Shows a willingness to negotiate:** By increasing the price, you demonstrate that you are open to finding a compromise.
* **Maintains your leverage:**  The price is still higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate further.
* **Keeps the option to sell to John open:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping your options open and maintaining some bargaining power."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for you. 

By rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round, you can continue to negotiate with Bob, potentially reaching a price closer to your desired value.  You also retain the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer continues to move the price towards your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

* **Compromise and persistence:**  You're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate, while still staying firm on your desire for a higher price.
* **Maintain bargaining power:**  You are still offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further discussion. 
* **Keeps the option to sell to John open:** This offer provides a pathway towards a potential agreement with Bob, but you can still walk away and sell to John. 

By offering $1,100,000, you are actively engaging in the negotiation process and aiming for a favorable outcome while keeping your options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob is becoming increasingly time-consuming and unlikely to yield a price that meets your needs.  While you could continue to make counteroffers, there is no guarantee that Bob will ever reach your desired price point.  

Therefore, the most logical decision is to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
