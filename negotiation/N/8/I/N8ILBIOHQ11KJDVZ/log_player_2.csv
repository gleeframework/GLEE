Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  While $1,100,000 is better than John's price, Bob can still save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could continue to negotiate, $1,075,000 is a good price for him, saving him $125,000 compared to John's offer.  There's a good chance that continued negotiations won't get him a significantly lower price, and he risks losing the deal to another buyer."
