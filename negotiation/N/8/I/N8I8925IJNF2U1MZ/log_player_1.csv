"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price of $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Value unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, I'm using an aggressive starting point to gauge his interest. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me confidence to be firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While I don't know Bob's maximum, there's room to negotiate. I'm willing to explore a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** Selling to John is still an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true interest and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above John's offer, keeping my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and accepting this offer is a good way to secure a sale without risking a lower counteroffer from Bob.
* **Risk of a lower offer:** While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might reject and then offer an even lower price in the next round.
* **Time is money:** Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal and move on, rather than continuing negotiations that might not result in a better outcome."
