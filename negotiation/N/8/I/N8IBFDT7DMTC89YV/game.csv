"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
