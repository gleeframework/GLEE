"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price, especially since we have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and the current market."",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We start by making a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value. This tactic aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A strong counteroffer can reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establish a lower anchor:** By starting low, we potentially shift the negotiation's midpoint in our favor. 

Even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer, it sets the stage for further negotiation and a potentially better final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $13,000 is still too high. We'll continue to negotiate and move closer to a price that works for us, keeping in mind our $15,000 alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."",
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
```

We're proposing a price that matches Alice's perceived value for the product. This is a strong negotiating position, as it offers a fair deal while maximizing our savings. It also signals to Alice that we're serious about purchasing but not willing to overpay. If she rejects this offer, we're still content with John's $15,000 backup."
