Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be split.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and you don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $200,000 surplus as possible without alienating Bob. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might make him suspicious or unwilling to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's privileged position.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages a response and potential counter-offer from Bob.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Key:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide to accept, make a new offer, or walk away.
* **Relationship Matters:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. Pushing too hard could damage future dealings."
