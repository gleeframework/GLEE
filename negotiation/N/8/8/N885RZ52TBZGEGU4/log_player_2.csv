"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to you. There's no reason to accept it in the first round. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price. This signals to Alice that I'm serious about buying but won't overpay. I know the product is worth $150 to her, and my offer is still above her cost, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I want to keep negotiating. There's no reason to rush into an agreement that isn't favorable to me. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price. I believe $110 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  This counteroffer shows flexibility and allows for potential agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above my maximum price of $100. I'm not willing to pay more than that, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still staying within my budget, as I am not willing to pay more than $120. This is my final counteroffer before I switch to John. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."
