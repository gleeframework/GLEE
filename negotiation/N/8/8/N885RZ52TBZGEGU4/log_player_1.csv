The goal is to earn as much as possible. While $110 is more than Bob's initial offer, it's still less than selling to John. Continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a better price for Alice."

While $120 is better than Bob's previous offers, it's still less than the guaranteed $150 from John.  Selling to John at this point is the most profitable option."
