"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $13,000? This gives us both a good deal, and it's still well below my initial offer.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer.  $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  To make this work for me, I'd need to be at $12,000. It's a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we are definitely getting closer! I'm willing to go up a bit, but $12,000 is still a stretch. How about $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to move closer.  To make this work for both of us, I'd need to be at $11,500. It's a small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,7,
