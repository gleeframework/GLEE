Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $13,000? This gives us both a good deal, and it's still well below my initial offer.  Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  To make this work for me, I'd need to be at $12,000. It's a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to move closer.  To make this work for both of us, I'd need to be at $11,500. It's a small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
