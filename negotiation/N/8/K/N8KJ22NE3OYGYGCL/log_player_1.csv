Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $115 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very good for you.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a profit regardless.

**Why not other options:**

* **$120:** While this is Bob's maximum, starting at his highest acceptable price might make him hesitant. 
* **$100:** This is the price John will pay, leaving potential profit on the table.
* **Less than $100:** This would be selling yourself short and losing potential profit."
