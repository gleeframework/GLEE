Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
