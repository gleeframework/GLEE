# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is a serious offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $885,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident that it's the best compromise we can reach.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $885,000 is close to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay. There's a chance that by rejecting and making another counteroffer, Bob can push Alice to accept a price closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $860,000 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I've reached my limit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than Bob's preferred price.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much further. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he has a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at this point and avoid any further negotiation."
