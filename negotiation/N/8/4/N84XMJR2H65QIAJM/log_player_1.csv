{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob, even though I'm not revealing specifics.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.  If he seems hesitant or counteroffers too low, I'll likely move on to John, since my goal is to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). While $10,000 is closer to his perceived value than my initial offer, it's still not a good deal for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to be strategic and consider his willingness to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, implying that even at $11,000, it's still a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept the deal with John for $15,000. The decision will depend on how much I'm willing to negotiate and my assessment of Bob's likelihood of accepting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to go above $10,000 for this product. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. At this point, the negotiation has stalled, and I'm not sure I can get Bob to agree on a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, I'll take the secure option and sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me the highest possible profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
