"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a price of $1,200,000. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe this price reflects its value fairly.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me and the fact that I can get the same product from John for the same price. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
