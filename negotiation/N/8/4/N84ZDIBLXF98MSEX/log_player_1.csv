"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a price of $1,200,000. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe this price reflects its value fairly.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'm going to try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,000,000.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'm going to continue trying to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me and the fact that I can get the same product from John for the same price. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation! While I'd love to get more than $1,000,000, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  I've got four rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
