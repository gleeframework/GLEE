```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point, but it's also a bit above my minimum value. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also willing to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum value. It's better to sell to him than to John."
