Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $115 is my initial offer, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to still get a price above my minimum.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it too high might make Bob reject it outright.  By starting at $115, I'm still guaranteeing a profit even if he negotiates down slightly."
