"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this price is still fair considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $750,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $750,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
