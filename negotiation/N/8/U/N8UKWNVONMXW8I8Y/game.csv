"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for such a unique and valuable item. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I'm not sure I can do more than that.  Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for such a unique and valuable item.
