"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's potential. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000? This gives you a significant discount while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1,300,000? This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to compromise to get the product. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
