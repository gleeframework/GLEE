"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's meet halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 isn't quite working for me. Let's split the difference - $10,125.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable at that price.",10125.0,Alice,5,
