"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fairer offer considering the product's potential.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
