Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial high offer will help you gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000 gives you a strong fallback position and lets you be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,500,000) and even Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's willingness to negotiate indicates he's interested. By rejecting his initial low offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to the product's true worth.
* **John provides security:** You have the safety net of John's offer, allowing you to confidently negotiate for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fairer offer considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's initial offer while still staying significantly above your minimum price.  
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""true value"" and ""potential,"" you reinforce that your offer is based on the product's worth, not just arbitrary numbers.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help you better understand how much room for negotiation Bob has and how determined he is to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob is now offering $1,250,000, which is slightly above his own perceived value of $1,200,000. This indicates he's serious and willing to pay a premium.
* **Close Enough:** While not ideal, $1,250,000 is a reasonable profit and a significant amount of money. Holding out for more might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means you receive the funds sooner, allowing you to potentially reinvest or utilize them elsewhere."
