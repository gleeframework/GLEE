Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This would still leave you a significant profit and be a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm not willing to settle for $1,050,000 just yet. I believe the product's worth more and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves significant room for profit on your end. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, I believe the product's worth more than $1,075,000.  I'm prepared to continue negotiating to reach a price that's fair for both of us."
