"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value it at $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a significant amount for me. This would still be a substantial profit for you, and we could close the deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. However, I still need to make a substantial profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
