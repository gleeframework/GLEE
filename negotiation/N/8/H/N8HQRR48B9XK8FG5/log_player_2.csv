{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value it at $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I want to keep pushing for a lower price.  I'll continue to counter-offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a significant amount for me. This would still be a substantial profit for you, and we could close the deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. However, I still need to make a substantial profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is very close to my last counter-offer of $1,050,000. While I'd love to get it even lower, at this point, it's a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product. I don't want to risk Alice going back up in price or losing the deal altogether. I'll accept her offer and move on."
