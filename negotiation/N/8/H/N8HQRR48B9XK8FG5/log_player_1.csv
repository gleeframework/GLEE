Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value it at $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer:

This would still be a substantial profit for you, and we could close the deal. Let's find a middle ground.
