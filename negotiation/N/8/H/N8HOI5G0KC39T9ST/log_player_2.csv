"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way too high. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price before even considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives room for negotiation.  We don't want to go too low too quickly and risk offending Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $10,000 is still too high. We'll continue to counter-offer and see if we can get closer to a desirable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

We're splitting the difference here to show Alice we're willing to move, but we're still aiming for a price closer to our ideal."
