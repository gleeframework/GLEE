Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your guaranteed $1,000,000.

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob doesn't outright reject the offer."
