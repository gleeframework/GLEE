"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My counteroffer is $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $987,500. This would give you a healthy profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $987,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
