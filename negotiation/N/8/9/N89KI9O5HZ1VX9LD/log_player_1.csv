Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still making a profit of $150,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob has room to negotiate and still come out ahead.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes the win-win potential.

This approach balances your desire for a high price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still a significant profit, I'm not ready to settle just yet. Bob is clearly motivated to buy, and I have room to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and still value the product highly.
* **Potentially get a better price:**  Bob might be willing to go higher if he thinks he might lose the deal.
* **Gain information:**  By seeing how much he's willing to move, I can gauge his true buying power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This reflects the product's value and still gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining optimism:** The message emphasizes the win-win potential and encourages Bob to agree.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm still open to going lower, but I'm not giving up on a higher price.

This approach allows me to continue the negotiation while also showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1125000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1150000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is now my original offer, and it represents a good compromise.  Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Profitable deal:** It's a significant profit for me, earning me $150,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The back-and-forth is getting longer, and there's no guarantee I can get a higher price.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  Bob might walk away if I continue to counteroffer, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,000,000.

By accepting, I secure a good deal and avoid the risk of a longer, more uncertain negotiation."
