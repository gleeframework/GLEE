"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This reflects the product's value and still gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1125000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1150000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
