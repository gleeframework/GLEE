"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  Let's make this happen!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $95 is still a little low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $105.  This is my final offer, let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97, but it's still a bit too low.  To be honest, I'm considering selling this to someone else who's offering me a much better price. However, I like doing business with you. If you can come up just a little to $100, I'm willing to make this deal happen. It's a great price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,7,
