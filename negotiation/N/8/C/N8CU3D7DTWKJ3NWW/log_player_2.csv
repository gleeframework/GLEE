"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your interest. Would you be open to exploring this further? If so, let's aim for a price that allows me to cover my costs and still leaves room for a reasonable profit, perhaps around $120. I'm confident this investment will pay off for you in terms of quality and utility. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards your $150 maximum."
