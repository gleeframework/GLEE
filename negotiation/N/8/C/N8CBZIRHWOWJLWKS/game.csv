"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree it has potential. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. This price reflects the value you've placed on it, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
