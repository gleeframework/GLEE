,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  I understand this is a significant gap, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but we're still pretty far apart. I can go up to $750,000. This offer takes into account the value I place on the product while acknowledging you need to get a fair deal too.  What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your budget constraints.  I'm confident this is a fair and reasonable offer.  Let's get this deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $1,000,000 is still a bit rich for me, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product at this price.  Let me know if you're open to closing the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
