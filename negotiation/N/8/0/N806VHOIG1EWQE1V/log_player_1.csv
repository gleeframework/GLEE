Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  Here's my reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't accept anything less.
* **Potential upside:** By offering a higher price, I increase the chance of getting more than my minimum. There's a possibility Bob values the product even higher than $1,500,000 and is willing to pay.
* **Risk mitigation:**  Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

This strategy balances the desire for maximum profit with the need to secure a sale."
