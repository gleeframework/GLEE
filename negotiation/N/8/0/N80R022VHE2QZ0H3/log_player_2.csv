Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm ready to make a final concession.  I'll offer the product for $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise from my earlier offers, and it reflects the value you place on the product.  Let's finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below John's $1,000,000 offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting her current offer would be overpaying by $50,000. Buying from John guarantees the best possible price."
