"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $150. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to quickly establish a lower price point for negotiation. It's also lower than my maximum budget of $120, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is closer to my maximum budget, I still want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further. It's also worth noting that I have the option to buy from John for $120 if this negotiation fails, so there's less pressure to accept a price above my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than my ideal price.  My counteroffer of $115 is a compromise, closer to my budget of $120, and hopefully gives Alice a strong incentive to accept.  This is a more moderate counteroffer compared to the previous round, which could indicate a willingness to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my budget, I'm not willing to go above my initial maximum of $120. It's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $130, so it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
