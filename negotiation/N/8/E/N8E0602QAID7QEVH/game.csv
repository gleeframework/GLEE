"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing my interest in the product.  While I see the value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a significant gain for you given the product's worth to me.  Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the product's value to you and my target price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm feeling optimistic.  I'm offering $1,275,000.  It's a fair price that's still a good profit for you, and it's the most I can realistically afford. Let's finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm counteroffering at $1,290,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my target price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
