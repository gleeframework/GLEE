Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he haggles you down.
* **Understanding Bob's valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob allows you to aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) gives him an incentive to negotiate, while still securing a substantial profit for you.
* **The ""sweet spot"":** $925,000 seems like a sweet spot that is significantly higher than your minimum while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider seriously."
