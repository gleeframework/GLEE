"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my minimum acceptable price.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your own willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to accept $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $925,000. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",925000.0,Alice,5,
