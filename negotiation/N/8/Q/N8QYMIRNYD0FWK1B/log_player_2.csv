"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our $150 maximum."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $125?"",

}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer a bit below our maximum but leaving room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

While closer to our desired price, we still have room to negotiate with Alice before considering John's offer."
