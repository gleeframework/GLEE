# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, I can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out.  $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
