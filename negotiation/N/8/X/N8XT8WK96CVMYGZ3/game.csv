"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $85 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm going to need to stick to my previous offer of $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time here, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50. I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're running out of time, but I'm still not willing to pay $89. I'm willing to meet you at $86.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",86.5,Bob,8,
