"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, we believe it's worth $12,000 to you. However, I understand budgets and am willing to make a special offer. Would you be interested in purchasing this product for $10,000? This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a price that's still above its market value but below its perceived worth to you. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is clearly willing to negotiate further.** Her message emphasizes the product's value to you while hinting at flexibility on the price. 
* **You have a fallback option.** John offers a price ceiling at $12,000, so you won't be left without the product.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price closer to her $8,000 valuation."
