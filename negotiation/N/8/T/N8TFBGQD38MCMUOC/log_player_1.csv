"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I might need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Still Too Low:**  While closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There are still rounds remaining. I want to see if I can push Bob higher.
* **Staying Flexible:** While John's offer is tempting, I want to exhaust all options with Bob before moving on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but I'm still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** Framing it as a ""fair price"" can appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Leaving Room for More Negotiation:** $11,000 still gives me some space to move if needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $10500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $10,500 is still below my desired price point.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I'm not yet at a point where I need to settle, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Staying Patient:** I have rounds remaining to keep negotiating. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Push:** I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm increasing my offer incrementally to show good faith. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  Again, I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by framing the offer as a compromise.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  I still have rounds to go, so this offer leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to meet you halfway. I am willing to pay $11000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** While $11,000 is very close to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to settle.  
* **Possible Higher Offer:** We're in the middle of the negotiation process. With a few rounds remaining, I believe there's still a chance Bob might offer more.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** Although I'm aiming for a better price from Bob, I'm aware that John's offer provides a secure fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $11,250?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm pushing for a higher price but increasing the offer by a smaller amount this time. This shows I'm willing to be flexible but still value the product.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  The ""fair compromise"" language continues to emphasize a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Pressure to Close:** This is likely the final round of negotiation before I consider John's offer. This offer puts the pressure on Bob to decide."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I am willing to pay $11000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $11,000, and I'm unwilling to drop below my desired price point.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to close the deal with Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed profit of $15,000, which is higher than what I'm likely to achieve with Bob at this point. 

It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John and walk away."
