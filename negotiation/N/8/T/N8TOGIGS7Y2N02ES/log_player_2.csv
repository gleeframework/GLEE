"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product that will meet your needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

The product is worth more to Alice than it is to me, so I should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to me. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll try to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though - I'll throw in a free premium service package worth $500. This will sweeten the deal and make it more attractive to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, even with the free service package.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000. It's a better deal for me, even without the service package."
