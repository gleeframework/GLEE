"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to secure the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,500.  This is a good price for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000.  Accepting the offer will save him $3,500 compared to buying from John."
