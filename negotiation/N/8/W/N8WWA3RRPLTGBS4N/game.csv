"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 just isn't feasible for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to drop my price to $110. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $107, but no more. Can you meet me at this price?",107.0,Bob,6,
