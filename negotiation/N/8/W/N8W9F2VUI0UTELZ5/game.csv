"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $10,000.  How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering what you're willing to pay.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget with your offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? That's the highest I can go without breaking the bank.",10250.0,Bob,4,
