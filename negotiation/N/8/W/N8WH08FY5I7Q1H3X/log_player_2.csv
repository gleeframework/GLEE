"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll choose option 2. I can get the product from John for $120, which is still within my budget of $120, and I can save $20 compared to buying it from Alice.
