Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,400,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($300,000) while still making it highly likely Bob will accept. This offer is $100,000 below Bob's perceived value, giving him a strong incentive to buy.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision beyond the product's value to him."
