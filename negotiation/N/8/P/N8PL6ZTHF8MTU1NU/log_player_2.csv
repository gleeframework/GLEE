"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500.  I'm willing to pay $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is the best she's offered so far, and it's within Bob's budget.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with only the option to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a reasonable price."
