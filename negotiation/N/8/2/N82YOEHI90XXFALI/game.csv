"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like it!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like it!",125.0,Alice,5,
