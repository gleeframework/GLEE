,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  I'm interested in the product but I'd be happy to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not quite ready to sell it to you for $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my offer of $14000. It's the best I can do.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $15500. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $15500. I'm willing to go up to $15250. This is really my final offer.  What do you say?",15250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $15250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15500 and $15250. I'll sell it to you for $15375. What do you think?",15375.0,Alice,7,
