Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $112 is a good price, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal.  I'd rather sell to Bob than to John, and we're still within a reasonable margin for me."
