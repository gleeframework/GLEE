"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I think this is a very competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly above her value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great deal for you given your value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe I can get a better price. Buying from John is still a fallback option if the negotiations fail, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to me. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within a reasonable range for me. It's close enough to my target price without risking further negotiation and potential stalemates.  Since I'm getting a good price, it's in my best interest to close the deal now and avoid the risk of either rejecting and counter-offering or buying from John for a much higher price."
