"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I think this is a very competitive price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great deal for you given your value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to me. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",885000.0,Alice,5,
