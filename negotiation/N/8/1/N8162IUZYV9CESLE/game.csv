"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, as it reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from owning it.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer $850,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear you see the inherent value in this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything less than $900,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the significant returns you stand to gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise, and hopefully a good starting point for a final agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
