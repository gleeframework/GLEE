"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering its potential and my resources.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $900,000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $850,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my resources.",850000.0,Bob,4,
