"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  It seems we both recognize the significant value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about we settle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and moving closer to my price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,225,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
