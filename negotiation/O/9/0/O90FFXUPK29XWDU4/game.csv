"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would you consider $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but I still think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. It seems like we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,625?",13625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to consider $13,625, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it more appealing. How about we do $13,750? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",13750.0,Alice,7,
