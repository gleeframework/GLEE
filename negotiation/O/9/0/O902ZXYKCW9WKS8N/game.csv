"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,087,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,031,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $1,125,000. This is my final compromise.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
