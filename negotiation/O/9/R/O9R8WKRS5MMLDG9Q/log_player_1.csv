Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000 is a good starting point:**  It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strong opening message:**  It highlights the value for Bob and frames the price as fair.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher offer, I aim to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I have a good starting point and can potentially negotiate up from there.
* **Encourage Bob to counter:**  This gives me the opportunity to assess his true interest and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Keep John as a fallback:** Knowing I can always sell to John for $800,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I believe I can push for a higher price by counter-offering. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to negotiate further.  This positions me to potentially secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise tone:**  The message acknowledges Bob's position while maintaining my own.
* **Midpoint offer:**  $1,050,000 is a halfway point between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes that the offer is fair for both parties.

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with a midpoint price, I aim to:

* **Signal flexibility:**  It shows Bob I'm open to negotiation and willing to work towards an agreement.
* **Maintain a profitable deal:**  $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum price and brings me closer to my desired profit.
* **Increase the likelihood of acceptance:**  The midpoint offer makes it harder for Bob to reject without appearing unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to continue negotiating.  This strategy aims to:

* **Push for a better price:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,050,000.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I keep the pressure on Bob and show him that I'm not willing to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Assess Bob's true interest:**  If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to come up a bit further."

{""message"": ""Bob,  $975,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart.  To show I'm serious about working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  I think it's a fair price considering the value this product offers you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is stated clearly to indicate that I'm serious about ending the negotiation at this price.
