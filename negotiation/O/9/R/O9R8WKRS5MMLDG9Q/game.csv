"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
