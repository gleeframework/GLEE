"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $775,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll counter with an offer of $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $710,000 to try and close this deal.  I think that's a fair offer, considering we're both compromising a bit.",710000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $710,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll counter with an offer of $720,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",720000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $715,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll counter with an offer of $725,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,9,
