"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is still too high, and there is room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  He can likely secure a better deal by counter-offering again."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away or he'll end up buying from John for a significantly higher price. At $1,120,000, he's still getting a good deal and saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
