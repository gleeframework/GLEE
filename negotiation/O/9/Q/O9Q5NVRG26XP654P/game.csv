"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $13,000? It's a bit higher than your budget, but it's still a good compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm really eager to get this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
