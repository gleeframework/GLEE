"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my maximum spending limit is $800,000,  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and  allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I've had considerable interest in this product, and to be completely transparent, I have another offer closer to my asking price. However, I value our conversation and believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Considering my maximum budget is $800,000,  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate upwards, and we are still significantly below John's offer. We need to keep pushing to get closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,500,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest and effort during this negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By round 5, we need to start solidifying a deal. Offering Bob the same price John is offering creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept and prevents us from going lower than our guaranteed sale price."
