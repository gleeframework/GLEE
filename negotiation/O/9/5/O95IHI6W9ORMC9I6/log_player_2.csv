"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($15,000).**  
* **You have 9 rounds left to negotiate.** There's a good chance you can get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is currently a worse option.** It's better to see if you can negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** $13,000 is well within your $15,000 limit.
* **Moderate reduction:**  It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer ($14,500), showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's still room for Alice to come down a bit, so there's potential for a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $14,800 is still over your $15,000 limit.
* **Alice is not budging much:**  Her offer is only slightly lower than the initial offer, which suggests she's not very flexible.
* **Time is on your side:** You still have several rounds left. By rejecting this offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:**  This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise, but still within your budget.
* **Testing Alice's limits:** By increasing your offer slightly, you're testing Alice's willingness to budge closer to your target price.
* **Still room for negotiation:** There's still a gap between your offer and Alice's previous offer. This leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget:**  $15,200 exceeds your $15,000 limit, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower, given her previous offers.
* **John's offer is the best option:** Buying from John for $15,000 is within your budget and provides a guaranteed purchase.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continued negotiation with Alice risks exceeding your budget and potentially reaching a stalemate.  

It's better to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of getting stuck in a negotiation that won't end in your favor."
