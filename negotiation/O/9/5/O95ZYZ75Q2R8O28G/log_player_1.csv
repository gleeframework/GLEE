Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $149. I believe it's a great deal and I'm hoping you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still keeps the price very close to your desired minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you could start at $150, it might make Bob less inclined to negotiate. A slightly lower price appears more flexible. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit while still giving Bob a reason to consider the offer."
