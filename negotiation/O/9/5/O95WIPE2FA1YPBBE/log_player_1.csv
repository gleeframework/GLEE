{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **It gives you room to negotiate:** This price leaves room for you to potentially lower the price if Bob counters, without going below your minimum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** This offer demonstrates your confidence in the product's value and sets a clear expectation for the negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, so be prepared to counter Bob's offers if needed and be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob won't meet your minimum price."

Bob is being stubborn and unwilling to move much further.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him. You can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly more than Bob's final offer and meets your minimum price."
