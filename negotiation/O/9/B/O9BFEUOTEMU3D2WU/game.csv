"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and while I value it at a higher price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from what I could receive elsewhere, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
