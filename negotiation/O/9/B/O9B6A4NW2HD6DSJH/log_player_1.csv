Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value & Certainty:**  Selling to Bob quickly at $14,000 might be preferable to the guaranteed $12,000 from John, even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
