"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $175. It's worth a lot more, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($175) since I know the product is worth at least $150 to me. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a good profit. I'm also using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120, which is still above my minimum price of $150, but is a significant decrease from my original offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $120 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $100 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking to a price above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to find a compromise, potentially leading to a deal."
