# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth your consideration.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. There's a chance she might be willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.
