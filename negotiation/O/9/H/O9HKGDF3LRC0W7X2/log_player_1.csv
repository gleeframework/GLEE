I'm starting with a price of $90, slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $75 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78?

While $78 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my $80 target in the next round."
