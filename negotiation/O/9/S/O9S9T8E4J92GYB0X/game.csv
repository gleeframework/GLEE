"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking $110 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? That's a fair price for both of us. ",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $100. This price is fair given the value of the product. If you're not willing to pay this, I have other options.  ",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",92.0,Bob,6,
