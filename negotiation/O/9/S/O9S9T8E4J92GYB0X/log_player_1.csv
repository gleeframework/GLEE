"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I can still do better. I'll try to get closer to my target price of $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? That's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $100. I have a buyer lined up at that price, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $100. This price is fair given the value of the product. If you're not willing to pay this, I have other options.  "", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is only offering $92, which is still below my minimum of $100. I'm not going to keep negotiating with him, especially since I have another buyer lined up to pay my minimum price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
