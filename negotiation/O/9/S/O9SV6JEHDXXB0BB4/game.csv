"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide tremendous value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
