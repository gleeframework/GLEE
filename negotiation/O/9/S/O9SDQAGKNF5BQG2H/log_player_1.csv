{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, knowing that my minimum is $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By mentioning ""open to negotiation"", I signal flexibility and willingness to work with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:**  I subtly imply the product's value to Bob without revealing specific details. This can pique his interest and encourage him to engage in the negotiation. 

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $18,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $19,000? It's a small step closer and might just make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledgement:**  I acknowledge Bob's position and show a willingness to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:**  I propose a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This creates a sense of fairness and encourages him to move towards a deal.
* **Incentive:**  I highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome by suggesting a ""small step"" that might make the deal work.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while trying to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $19000. How about we meet in the middle at $18500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $18,500 is only $500 away from my minimum price of $15,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $20,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It's a reasonable price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a profitable sale than to continue haggling and potentially end up selling to John for a lower price."
