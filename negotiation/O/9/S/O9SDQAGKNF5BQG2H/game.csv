"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $18000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $19000? It's a small step closer and might just make this work for both of us.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $19000. How about we meet in the middle at $18500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",18500.0,Bob,4,
