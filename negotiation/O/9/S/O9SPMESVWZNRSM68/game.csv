"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,1010000.0
"I appreciate your creative offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to split the difference quite that much. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1,010,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm counteroffering at $1,010,000. This is my last chance to negotiate, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1010000.0,Alice,7,,
