"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than Alice's original value, it's still above Bob's budget. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and Bob can always opt for John's offer.  It makes sense to reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a strong counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly closer to his maximum budget.  This shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating and willing to walk away.  A $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is significant, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget and even higher than her initial offer in round 1. While Bob wants to close the deal, he should continue to push for a lower price.  There are still multiple rounds to negotiate, and buying from John remains a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly, showing that he's willing to move but still maintains a firm stance. This time, Bob offers $875,000, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's most recent offer. This shows flexibility while still remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher with each round, making a deal with her increasingly unlikely.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating.  At this point, it's better for Bob to secure the product from John at a guaranteed $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
