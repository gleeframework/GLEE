"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm hoping to get a good price without pushing him away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer. It's a good middle ground that might encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130.  This is a slight increase from my last offer, but it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that might encourage Bob to close the deal without running the risk of losing him completely."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $127.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $7 less than my initial offer, and it's more than what John is offering.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing Bob completely."
