Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's estimated value of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving room for further discussion. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Initiate negotiations:** A firm offer encourages Bob to respond and engage in the process.
* **Secure a favorable price:**  The starting price is high enough to potentially yield a good profit, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away.
* **Keep the option open:** The offer doesn't close the door on selling to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to offer $875,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his initial offer, I signal that I am willing to negotiate further.
* **Potentially increase the price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I put pressure on him to increase his counteroffer. 
* **Keep the option of selling to John:**  Selling to John remains a viable option if the negotiations with Bob fall through.

My next counteroffer will aim to close the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest,  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the product's true value and gives you a great deal.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $925,000 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation. It also highlights that I'm looking for a win-win solution.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain control:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I maintain control of the negotiations.
* **Close the gap:** The counteroffer brings the price closer to my target while leaving room for further negotiations. 
* **Keep the option open:** Selling to John remains an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly below my initial asking price, but it's closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000.  Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While this is Bob's ""final offer,"" it's possible to negotiate further if I reject it. However, there's no guarantee he'll budge further. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is safe, but accepting Bob's offer means a quicker sale and potentially a faster return on the product. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out, potentially costing me time and money.

Accepting Bob's offer offers a good balance of maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
