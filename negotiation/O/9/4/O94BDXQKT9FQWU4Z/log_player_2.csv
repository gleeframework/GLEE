"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to let it go for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100.  I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to spend up to $100 right now. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $160. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $100. I will continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really committed to getting this product, but I can't go above $110.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $160, which would be $135. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still above my maximum budget of $100. Even though we have several rounds left, I'm not confident I can negotiate a lower price that I'm comfortable with. I'm going to take the guaranteed deal from John for $100 to save myself time and potential frustration."
