"I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to let it go for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to spend up to $100 right now. Would you be willing to consider that? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $160. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really committed to getting this product, but I can't go above $110.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $160, which would be $135. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
