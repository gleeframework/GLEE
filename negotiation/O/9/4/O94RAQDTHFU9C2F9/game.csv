"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. How about we meet at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $95, which is $97.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",97.5,Bob,6,
