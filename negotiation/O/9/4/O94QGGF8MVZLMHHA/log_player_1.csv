{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you earn significantly more than your minimum threshold. It also builds rapport by acknowledging the value to Bob, making him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $750,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. It seems we are at an impasse. It's time to move on and sell to John to secure a guaranteed price that meets my requirements."
