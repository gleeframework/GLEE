"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $900000 is above my budget for this purchase. I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product, as I believe that reflects a fair value given my current understanding. I'm eager to finalize this deal if you're willing to consider my offer.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $820000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it still reflects a fair value for the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll make a new offer of $790000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",790000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I value your product and want to make this deal work, I can't go above $760000 at this time. This offer is within my budget and still offers you a fair return. If you're open to this final adjustment, we can finalize the sale.",760000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it will be my last. I'll offer you $780000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",780000.0,Alice,7,
