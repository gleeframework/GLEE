"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Selling to John is better:**  While $8,000 is better than nothing, selling to John for $10,000 is significantly more profitable. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, it's not unreasonable. I have 8 rounds left, so there's still a chance to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to stand my ground. This might make him more likely to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $8,000, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This still leaves a reasonable margin for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Middle Ground:** Offering $9,000 is a middle ground that suggests I'm serious about a deal but not desperate. 
* **Positive Language:** The message remains positive and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle on $8,750 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still closer to John's offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I can get from John. 
* **Room for improvement:** I still have 6 rounds left. By continuing to negotiate with Bob, I might be able to nudge him closer to my target price of $9,000. 
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer again demonstrates that I'm not under pressure to sell at his price. This could potentially encourage him to increase his offer even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,750.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $8,875?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $125 this time, showing a willingness to close the gap.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the word ""compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the offer as a fair solution.
* **Closing Statement:** The message ends with a statement suggesting a quick and positive closure to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're willing to come down further, Alice. Considering my budget, could we agree on $8,800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my last counteroffer of $8,875.
* **Risk of losing John:** With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that if I continue to negotiate, John might change his mind or find another product.
* **Secure a decent profit:** While $8,800 is less than what I'd get from John, it's still a decent profit and a reasonable outcome given the circumstances. 
* **Time is of the essence:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and prevents potential complications with John."
