Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below your ""guaranteed"" price with John leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a better deal.
* **Time Value:**  While Alice has a guaranteed buyer, selling to Bob now avoids potential delays or complications that might arise with waiting for John.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while still ensuring a high likelihood of selling the product."
