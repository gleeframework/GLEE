"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $16,000 on it. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget, around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I see where you're coming from, but $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
