You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial offer. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to go that low. I have a backup plan with John.
