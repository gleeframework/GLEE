Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $125, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $125 leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value for Bob:** The product is worth $150 to Bob, so $110 is still a good deal for him.
* **Negotiation Room:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $100 is a guarantee, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Round Counteroffer:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price of $115, explaining that it's a fair compromise and still a good deal for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. It's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $115 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him ($150) to further encourage acceptance.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and cooperative tone can help keep negotiations amicable."
