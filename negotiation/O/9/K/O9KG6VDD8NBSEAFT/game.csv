"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  How about we settle at $12,500?  I think that's a fair price.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $12,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to move a bit more. How about $13,000 even?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",14000.0,Alice,7,
