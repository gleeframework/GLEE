Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems stuck at a price point too far above your maximum. She's gone back up to $14,000, and it's unlikely she'll budge much further.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000, so it's better to take the sure thing and save the $4,000."
