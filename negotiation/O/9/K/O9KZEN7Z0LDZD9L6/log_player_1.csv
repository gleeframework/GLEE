Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13800}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a good price, but $13,400 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,600? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on!"", ""product_price"": 13600}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not too far off from the middle ground, but I'm still trying to save a bit. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a bit more, this offer is just $100 less than my previous counteroffer and is still significantly higher than John's offer.  It's getting late in the game, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
