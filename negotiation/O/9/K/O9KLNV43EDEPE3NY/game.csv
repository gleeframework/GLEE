"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 represents the value I see in the product, I understand your budget constraints. Could we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm still not quite there at $10,500.  Could we try $9,500?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this product would be a great investment for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
