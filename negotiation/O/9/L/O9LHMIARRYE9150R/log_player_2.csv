"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, there's no potential to save money by negotiating. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
