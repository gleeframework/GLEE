""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $13,000 or $13,500 is still a significant profit over John's offer of $12,000.

By aiming high but staying reasonable, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal that maximizes her profit."
