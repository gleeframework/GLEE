"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest but clearly states that the initial price is too high. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** My ideal price is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but I need to gauge her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $125, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great product and I think it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice is now offering the product for $125, which is only $5 more than her value and a significant saving compared to John's $150 price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to negotiate a few more dollars off, there's a risk that Alice will refuse and I'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort.  The potential savings are likely not worth the extra hassle."
