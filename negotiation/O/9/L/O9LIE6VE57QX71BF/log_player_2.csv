"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a starting price of $14,000. I believe this product would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's starting price, which might encourage her to negotiate further. It also leaves room to increase the offer if needed, while still staying well below John's $15,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a competitive price for this product. To reach a compromise, I can offer it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate. A counteroffer closer to $11,000 could potentially get us a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
