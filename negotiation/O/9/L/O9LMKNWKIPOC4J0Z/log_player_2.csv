Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet my expectations. In light of that, I am prepared to consider your offer more closely. However, I must respectfully decline your proposal of $1,250,000. My current valuation of the product remains at $1,350,000. I am open to discussing terms that might bridge the gap between our positions, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. Please let me know if you are willing to adjust your offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* Alice has stood firm at $1,350,000.  
* This is still a better price than buying from John at $1,500,000.
* Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher cost.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
