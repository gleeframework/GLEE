Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe it offers significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our own minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, increasing our profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring a successful sale."
