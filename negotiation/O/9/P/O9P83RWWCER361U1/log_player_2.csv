"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product, and it's a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's try to meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're close to your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $13,250. It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above my budget of $12,000. While we've been close in our negotiations, I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with in the remaining rounds.  To avoid further negotiation and potential frustration, it's best to secure the product from John for $12,000, my maximum price."
