# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000, and I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,600,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me while being closer to your initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  Let's work towards a deal that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,450,000.  At this point, the difference between her offer and John's price is only $50,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
