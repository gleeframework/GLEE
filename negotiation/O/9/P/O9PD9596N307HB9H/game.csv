"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000, and I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000 for it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,600,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me while being closer to your initial offer. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for me.  How about $1,350,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  Let's work towards a deal that's mutually beneficial.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
