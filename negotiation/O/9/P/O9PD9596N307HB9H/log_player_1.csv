{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000, and I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I am aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also willing to negotiate. By starting at $1,750,000, I leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a productive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. It's too risky to accept, as it would leave me with a substantial loss. I will reject the offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,600,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me while being closer to your initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm taking a more assertive approach this time. I'm emphasizing that Bob's offer is too low and I'm setting a firm counteroffer at $1,600,000. This is still higher than my minimum price but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm also re-iterating my interest in selling to him to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for me.  How about $1,350,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. Selling to John for $1,500,000 would be more profitable. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to come up with a counteroffer that brings us closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  Let's work towards a deal that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still maintaining a price above my minimum. I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise and highlighting the value of the product for him. This is a more aggressive approach, as I'm trying to close the gap quickly. I'm also adding a friendly note about finding a ""mutually beneficial"" deal to encourage Bob to accept."
