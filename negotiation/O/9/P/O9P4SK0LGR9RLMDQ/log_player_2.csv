"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and we're looking to sell it at a special introductory price of $75. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice. Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. This doesn't mean we'll get it for $60, but it opens the door for counteroffers and hopefully a final price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $65 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. Let's see if we can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  Could you do $62? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 62
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise but still aims for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding our offer appealing, Bob. Considering your feedback, how about we settle at $63 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and $63 is a good price. It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds. Accepting now secures a good discount."
