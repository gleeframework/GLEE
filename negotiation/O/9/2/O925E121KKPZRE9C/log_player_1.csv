Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal with Bob is impossible.

**The Offer**

Since any price Bob is willing to pay is less than your minimum, you should make an offer that is just above Bob's valuation in the hopes that he does not negotiate further.  You will make more money by selling to John.

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob will likely reject this offer:**  He knows what he's willing to pay and your offer is above that. 
* **Don't waste time negotiating:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John. Prolonged negotiation with Bob will only delay the inevitable.

**After Bob Rejects**

Politely thank Bob for his time and move on to John. You'll secure your $1,500,000 sale swiftly."
