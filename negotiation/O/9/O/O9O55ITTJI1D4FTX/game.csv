"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $1,200,000 than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
