"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value and potential for growth. Given its significance, I believe it's worth more than just monetary exchange. However, if we're focusing on financial transactions, I propose an offer of $10,000 for you to consider. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity cost for both of us. I understand that you see its value at $8,000, and I appreciate your perspective. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Please let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,1,
