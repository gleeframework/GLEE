"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to me is at least $800000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is intriguing but a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, considering your own valuation of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a significant concession from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. This is a reasonable midpoint between our current offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
