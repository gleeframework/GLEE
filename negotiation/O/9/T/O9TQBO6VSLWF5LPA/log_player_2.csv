"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value for you. This unique item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I am offering it to you at a special price tailored to our mutual benefit.

Considering its significance to you, I propose to sell the product to you for $900,000. This offer not only ensures you secure this valuable asset at a favorable price but also allows me to maximize the return on my investment.

Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations and if you wish to proceed with the purchase. I am confident that together we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice
