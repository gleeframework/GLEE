"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120 to me. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be worth $100 to you. Let's make this deal happen! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in trying to save a few dollars. You have 9 more rounds to explore potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A $10 reduction is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It shows you're serious about buying but are also looking for a good deal.
* **Direct communication:** Clearly stating your interest and price helps Alice understand your position. 
* **Open to discussion:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to negotiate. How about we aim for a middle ground? I propose $95 for the product. This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** Alice has moved closer to your price point, and $95 is a fair compromise.
* **Time is money:**  You've already rejected one offer, and accepting now saves you time and potential further negotiation rounds.
* **Slight savings:**  While you could try to push for a lower price, the savings might not be significant enough to justify the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again."
