Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Setting a Baseline:** This initial offer establishes a baseline for the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether it's worth considering or if I should sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $100, which is still a better deal than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100 while still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $95 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize that it's still a ""great deal"" to highlight the product's value and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fairness:**  Using words like ""fair"" and ""compromise"" creates a sense of good faith negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale. 
* **Another counteroffer:** If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and make a decision based on the price and my willingness to continue negotiating. 
* **Selling to John:**  If the negotiation doesn't lead to a mutually agreeable price, I'll sell to John for $100 to ensure I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  While I'm close to my goal, accepting his offer would still mean I'm losing money. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  The difference between Bob's offer and my minimum is only $10.  Further negotiation might lead to more frustration and time wasted.
* **Guarantee profit:** Selling to John for $100 ensures I get a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of continued negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This is the most financially advantageous option given the current circumstances."
