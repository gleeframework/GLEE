"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,800.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. $8,800 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8,600 for the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $8,700.",8700.0,Alice,5,
