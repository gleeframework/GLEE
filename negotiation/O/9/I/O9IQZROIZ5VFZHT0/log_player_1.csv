{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a $2,000 profit if Bob accepts. It's also a good starting point for negotiation. I've offered a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation and I've mentioned my willingness to negotiate to make Bob feel like he has some control in the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget is tight, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? I'm confident you'll find this to be a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,750 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,250. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly below my minimum price, but it's very close. I'm willing to accept it since it's a relatively small difference and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to negotiate a higher price with him in the future.  It's also a good deal compared to selling to John for $12,000."
