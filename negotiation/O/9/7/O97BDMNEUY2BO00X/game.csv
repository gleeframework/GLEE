"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? I'm open to discussing a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go for $9,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this is a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, which is $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the absolute minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, and I believe that's a fair compromise. It's a small step for you, but it makes a big difference for me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,900, but I'm not budging any further. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",9900.0,Alice,9,
