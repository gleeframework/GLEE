I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm aware of John's offer and I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

This still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,150,000. How about we meet at $1,120,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

While $1,120,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $1,130,000.  That's just a small step up from your offer, but it's the closest I can come right now. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 1130000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,120,000. How about we meet at $1,125,000? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal.

Bob's offer is just above my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal overall, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
