"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. This product is worth a minimum of $1000000 to me, but I believe its potential value to you could be significantly higher. I'm confident that it would be a strategic investment for your business. My initial offer is $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I believe it has great potential, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. If you're willing to negotiate, I'm ready to discuss it further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1000000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to bridge the gap a bit and come down to $1250000. This represents a significant value to you and allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1250000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1000000. Could we consider a price of $1100000? This would allow us both to benefit from the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
