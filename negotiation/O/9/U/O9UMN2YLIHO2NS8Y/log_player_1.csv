Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I believe it has great potential, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. If you're willing to negotiate, I'm ready to discuss it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
