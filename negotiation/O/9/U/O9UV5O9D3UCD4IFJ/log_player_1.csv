"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its value to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have room to negotiate and hope to get closer to my desired price. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000, which serves as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing him as a buyer.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids potential delays or complications with further negotiation."
