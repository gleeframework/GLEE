"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
