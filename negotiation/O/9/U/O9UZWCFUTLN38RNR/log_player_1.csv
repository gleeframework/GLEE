{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for the price, emphasizing the value to both of us. 
* **Open to Discussion:** My message encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  $950,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's estimated value.
* **Encourage counteroffers:** By leaving room for negotiation, I increase the likelihood of a successful sale.
* **Position myself for a good outcome:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can gauge his willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm not willing to accept a loss of $150,000.  

**Strategy:**

* **Continue Negotiation:** I believe there's still potential for a better deal with Bob.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price, aiming to find a compromise.
* **Test the Waters:** This will reveal Bob's true budget and his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Avoid a Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $950,000 to $900,000. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Seek Compromise:**  I'm open to further negotiation, suggesting we find a compromise that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer aims to find a price point that's more acceptable to Bob without sacrificing too much of my potential profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering a lower price, I'm testing Bob's willingness to negotiate further.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While $900,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a considerable profit compared to Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $875,000 is still too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a loss of $125,000.  

**Strategy:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation with Bob could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **No Compromise:** I've already lowered my price twice, and there's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to compromise any further.

By selling to John, I secure a better financial outcome and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might result in a lower price."
