"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a compromise, I'm proposing $2,100,000. This price reflects the unique features and substantial benefits this product offers you.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. This is my final offer.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $1,950,000 is a significant investment, I understand the value this product brings. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $2,000,000. This is a considerable concession and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $2,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a smart financial decision.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
