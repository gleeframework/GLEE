Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible while ensuring you get a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high gives you room to potentially negotiate down if needed, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This offer shows you understand the product's value to Bob without seeming overly aggressive or trying to extract every last dollar.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower, more collaborative price might be strategic.
* **Urgency:**  If you need to sell quickly, mentioning a deadline or alternative offer (without revealing John's specific offer) could encourage a faster decision."
