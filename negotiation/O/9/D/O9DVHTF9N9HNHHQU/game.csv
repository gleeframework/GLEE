"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $775,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000.  This is a final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
