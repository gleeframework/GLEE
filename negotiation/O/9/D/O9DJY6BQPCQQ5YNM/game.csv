"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a living, so I can't go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be. How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in your product.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I can do one better - how about $137.50? It's a small step up, but I think it's still a fair price for this great product",137.5,Alice,5,
