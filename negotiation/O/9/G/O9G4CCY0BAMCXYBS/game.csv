"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a purchase at that price.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a certain profit margin for my business. I am therefore unable to accept $85. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",87.5,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $88 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I hope this meets your expectations.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $89, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $89?",89.0,Bob,6,
