"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my best compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 just yet, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a strong compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. Let's try $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
