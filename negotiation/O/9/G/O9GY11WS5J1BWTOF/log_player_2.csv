# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $1,450,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $1,450,000, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.
*  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John, saving you $50,000."
