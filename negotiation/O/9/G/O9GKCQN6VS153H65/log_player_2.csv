"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $90.  It's worth at least $80 to me, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $90, which is less than the $100 you would pay John. Since your maximum budget is $100, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 and still allows you to buy the product."
