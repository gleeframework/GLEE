I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to get as much as possible from Bob.  I'm confident he'll counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm not willing to go that low yet. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. This should hopefully encourage Bob to increase his offer further."

While $130 is lower than I'd like, it's still a decent profit and Bob isn't likely to go any higher. I'm better off accepting his offer and securing the sale than risking him rejecting my counteroffer and walking away, or selling to John at a lower price."
