Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above her minimum ($12,000).
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other interest, Alice motivates Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above $12,000.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so aiming high initially is a calculated risk worth taking."
