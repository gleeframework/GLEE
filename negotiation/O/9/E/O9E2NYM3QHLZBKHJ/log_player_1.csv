Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This sets a high bar for the negotiation and allows for room to lower the price if necessary. I want to see how much Bob values the product and how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what I could get from John.  This deal is a good compromise and ensures a quick sale, which is beneficial for me."
