Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good deal, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  $950,000 is a good deal and closer to my desired outcome than selling to John for $1,000,000. It's a good compromise that still brings me a significant profit."
