"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very competitive price of $1,500,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Competitive Price:** I'm emphasizing the ""competitive"" nature of the offer to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:**  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and end the negotiation, I believe there's room for a better deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I'm not convinced Bob is willing to pay much more, but I want to test his commitment and see if he's truly willing to walk away if I don't meet his price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting and counter-offering, I can signal that I'm not desperate and that the product holds value beyond his initial offer.

**Strategy:**

My next counteroffer will likely be a compromise, but I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offering. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge at all."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 as a compromise. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm not giving away too much. 
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting the ""win-win"" potential of the deal to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a more reasonable compromise that still leaves some room for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to compromise, Bob will be more receptive to finding a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1300000. Can you consider this as a new compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Gradual Increase:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below my initial price and even my last counteroffer.
* **Test of Commitment:**  I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product.  If he rejects my next counteroffer, I might consider selling to John.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer further.

**Strategy:**

My next counteroffer will likely be around $1,350,000.  I'll explain that this is a fair compromise given the product's value and Bob's previous offers.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously reconsider selling to John, as the potential for a significantly higher deal with Bob seems unlikely at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $1,350,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, but still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Progress Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the progress we've made to encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm stressing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John. I'm reaching a point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1325000. Can you consider this as a new compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob's offer is only a small increase from his previous offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my last counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of running out of rounds without a significant improvement.  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be more strategic and consider the potential for a deal that is significantly better than John's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll make one more counteroffer, hoping to get Bob to agree to a price closer to $1,350,000. If he rejects, I'll likely accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed sale and avoid the risk of a stalemate with Bob. The potential for a much higher offer with Bob is dwindling, and I need to secure a deal within the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $1,340,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product and reflects the progress we've made in our discussions. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's seal this deal."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my last counteroffer before I consider John's offer. I'm aiming for a price that's slightly closer to my previous offer but still represents a significant increase from Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is the final offer, implying that if Bob rejects, I might move on to John's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm playing a high-stakes game, as the potential for a significantly higher offer is diminishing with each passing round. If Bob rejects this final offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of a deal falling through with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1312500. Can you consider this as a new compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds left, the potential for Bob to significantly increase his offer is extremely low.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Risk Avoidance:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all. 

**Strategy:**

It's time to secure a guaranteed sale. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a higher price with Bob, John's offer provides a safe and reliable outcome. I'm choosing to prioritize certainty and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
