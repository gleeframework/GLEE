"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10500?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not all the way to $9000. I'm willing to go to $11000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I really think we can meet in the middle somewhere. Can we try $10250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $9250, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I'll meet you at $10500. This is my final offer on the lower end, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
