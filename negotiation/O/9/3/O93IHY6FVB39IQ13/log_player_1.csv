Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a better price. I can still get $120 from John, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going to get me a price I'm happy with. I'm better off selling to John and getting my guaranteed $120."
