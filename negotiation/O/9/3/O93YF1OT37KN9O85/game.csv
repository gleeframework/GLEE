"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $750,000 is still too far from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant concession.  This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget. I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
