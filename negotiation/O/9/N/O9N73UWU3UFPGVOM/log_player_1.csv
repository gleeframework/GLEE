Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" we subtly imply that if Bob doesn't take it, someone else will.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
