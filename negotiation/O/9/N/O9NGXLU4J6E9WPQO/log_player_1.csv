Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm eager to work with you, but unfortunately, I can't go higher than this.
