Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm aiming to maximize profit, but I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $100 if this negotiation fails. 
* The friendly tone of the message is important for building rapport and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $90 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum value of $100. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while also reiterating my desire for a higher price. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further, which may encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer."

```

**Explanation:**
