Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $11,000 leaves some room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the ""great deal"" subtly highlights the value of the product. 
* **Flexibility:** This price is high enough to potentially close the deal quickly but allows for further negotiation if needed. 

I'm willing to go lower if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I want to start strong and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest.  This indicates there's room for negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is the fallback:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, so there's no rush to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll aim for a price that still gives me a good profit but is more appealing than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $10,500 splits the difference between my last offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Still Profitable:** $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm still making a profit. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. If he still rejects it, I'll likely go with Plan C and sell to John, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is only $250 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Further negotiation unlikely:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate but is unlikely to go significantly higher.
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer of $12,000.

**Conclusion:**  It's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and the possibility of losing a sale altogether."
