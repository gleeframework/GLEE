Let's start with a strong counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it leaves room for some negotiation."

Let's try a counteroffer of $1,100,000. It's a slight increase from my previous offer but still lower than Alice's price, and hopefully, it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
