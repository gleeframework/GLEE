"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also allows me to potentially get a good deal. I'm also framing the message in a positive way, highlighting the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 10 rounds, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 
I'm trying to find a compromise while still staying above my minimum threshold.  I'm also reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. However, $9,800 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $10,200.  This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get as much as possible. I'm emphasizing that this is a good deal for both of us and that we're getting closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a higher price with some more negotiation. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000, which is closer to Bob's offer and still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price and that it will be mutually beneficial for both of us. I'm also trying to close the deal by creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,700. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but with only two rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob. I'm not sure if I can get him to agree on a higher price within the remaining rounds.  It's safer to sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum and ensures a good outcome for me."
