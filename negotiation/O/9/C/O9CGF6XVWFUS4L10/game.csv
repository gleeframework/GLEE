"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Would you be willing to go down to $8500?  That's my top price for this.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $9000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
