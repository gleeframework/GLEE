"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to pay more."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  That's my top price for this."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $9000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice is willing to go down to $9,000, which is still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John."
