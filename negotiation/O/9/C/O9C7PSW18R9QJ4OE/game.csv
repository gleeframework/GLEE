"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. How about we meet at $12,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $12,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's the best I can do. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",12800.0,Bob,6,
