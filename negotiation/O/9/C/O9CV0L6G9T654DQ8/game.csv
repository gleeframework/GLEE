"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
