"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good ($12,000 is less than the product's value to you), there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's original price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows you're serious about buying the product but are determined to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10000 is a little too low for me. How about we settle on $11000? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price, and her current offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for you.  You value the product at $15,000, so you're saving $4,000 by accepting.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and you could risk losing the deal.  It's better to secure the product at a good price."
