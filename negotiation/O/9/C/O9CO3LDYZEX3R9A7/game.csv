"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and what I'm willing to part with it for.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if you agree.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,800. It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway again.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $9,800 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $9,100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. Let me know what you think.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $9,300? It's a small compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",9300.0,Alice,7,
