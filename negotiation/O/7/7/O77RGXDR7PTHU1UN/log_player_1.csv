"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for myself.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob while still leaving me a comfortable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still aiming for a profit of $300,000.  This price is a good compromise that might encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer.  I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to push for a higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer will ensure a $250,000 profit, which is still a significant amount."
