"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe $1,100,000 is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. It's also important to remember that I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so I don't need to settle for anything below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer, but still a price that is above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that allows us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum price.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This round is getting close to my minimum price, but it's still lower than I'd like.  Plus, we're already halfway through the rounds, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway.  Rather than continuing to negotiate, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. This is the best way to ensure I get the maximum value for my product."
