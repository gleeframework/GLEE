"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135. This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is the lowest I can go.",145.0,Alice,5,
