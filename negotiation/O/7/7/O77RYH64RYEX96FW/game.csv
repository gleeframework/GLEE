"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $960,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",960000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. That's the lowest I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as it will go. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",950000.0,Bob,6,
