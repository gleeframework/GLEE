Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I emphasize the product's worth to him, making the offer more attractive.
* **Open ended:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to establish a strong starting point and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $960,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $960,000 is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore that possibility.
* **Not rushing into a deal:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm aiming for a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as it will go. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my target price.  We seem to have reached a stalemate, and further negotiation may not yield a more favorable outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of continuing negotiations is that we may not reach an agreement at all.
* **Guaranteed outcome:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed outcome and ensures that I won't lose out entirely.

Although I prefer to sell at a higher price,  the risk of losing the deal altogether by continuing negotiations is too high.  Selling to John for $800,000 provides a secure and acceptable outcome."
