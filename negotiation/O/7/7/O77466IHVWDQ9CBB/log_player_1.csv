"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing him that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is worth more than $17,500.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500.  I'm starting to feel the pressure with only 3 rounds left, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I'm only one round away from selling to John for $15,000. I believe I can still get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000.  This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to close the deal, as this is my last chance to get a higher price from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to sell to John.  While Bob's offer of $16,000 is better than my minimum, I'm out of time for negotiation.  I can't risk another rejected offer and losing out on the sale completely.  Selling to John at $15,000 is a guaranteed sale and better than no sale at all."
