Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its worth to you.,180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $145 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll meet you at $152, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",152.0,Alice,5,
