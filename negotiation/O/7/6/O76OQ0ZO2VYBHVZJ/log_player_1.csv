"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $8,800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but selling to John for $10,000 remains a strong backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my best offer considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make an offer of $8,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. However, with 6 rounds remaining, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll continue to explore the possibility of a higher offer from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. However, I can't go lower than $8,800 at this point. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my willingness to reach a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make an offer of $8,200. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While I'm still willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $8,200 is only slightly above his initial offer of $8,000. It's unlikely he'll budge much further. 

With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum acceptable is high.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a good profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
