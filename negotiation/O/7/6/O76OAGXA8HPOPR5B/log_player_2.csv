"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $140 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has room to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible.  $130 is a reasonable counteroffer, showing Bob is serious about buying but still wants a good deal. It's also closer to Alice's value of $120, making it more likely she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal considering his initial goal was to pay no more than $150.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will counter with an even higher price or reject the offer completely.  Accepting at $135 secures the product at a good price and avoids potential further negotiation complications."
