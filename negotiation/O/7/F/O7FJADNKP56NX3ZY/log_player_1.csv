Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I'm confident it can bring you substantial value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. While $1,500,000 might scare Bob off, $1,300,000 still leaves room for negotiation (if needed) and increases the perceived value.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John guarantees your minimum price provides leverage. You can afford to be firm in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have some time. If you need to sell urgently, a lower price might be more suitable.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown factors. You might need to adjust based on his responses."
