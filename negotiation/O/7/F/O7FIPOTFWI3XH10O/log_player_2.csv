You can likely get a better price than $120.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

You're still aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer might get you closer to your goal of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to make a small compromise, though. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $127.50. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $127.50 is closer to your goal of $100, it's still more than you're comfortable with.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer could potentially get you closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $127.50 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's meet in the middle at $120. I'm ready to make a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go up to $120, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last offer. I can give you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $128. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is only willing to go down to $128, which is still more than you're comfortable paying. You're getting closer to your target, but it's likely that Alice won't budge any further. Buying from John for $150 ensures you get the product and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
