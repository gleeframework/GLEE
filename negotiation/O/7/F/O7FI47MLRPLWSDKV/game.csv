"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,275,000 for the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
