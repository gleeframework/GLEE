"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $18000 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $19000?  Let's make this happen!",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $19000 is slightly above my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $17500?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $18500?  That's a fair compromise, and it lets us both get this deal done.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose $18000 as a compromise. This price is within my budget and still reflects the value of the product.",18000.0,Bob,6,
