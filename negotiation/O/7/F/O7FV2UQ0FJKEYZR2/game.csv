"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
