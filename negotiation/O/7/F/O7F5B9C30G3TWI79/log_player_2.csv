# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in the product, but I think I can get a better deal. Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to reject her offer and see what John has to say.
