"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000 right now.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000, Bob. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
