"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a lower price.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,100,000? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,085,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this deal work.",1085000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're almost there.  $1,085,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. I'm willing to go to $1,080,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it'll help us close this deal quickly.  Let's make this happen.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
