Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and still leaves a good profit margin for me.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and still gives me a profit margin higher than John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to lowball me. While $1,400,000 is still above my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation at this point. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000. It's a secure deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on that for a potentially lower price from Bob."
