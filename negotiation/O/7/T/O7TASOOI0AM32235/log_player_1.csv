""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know we have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. Therefore, our goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering a price slightly below our guaranteed sale price ($1,500,000) might entice Bob while still maximizing our potential profit. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and the ""return on investment,"" we aim to justify the high price to Bob, even though we haven't explicitly revealed our minimum.

This offer aims to strike a balance between a price appealing to Bob and ensuring Alice doesn't leave too much money on the table."
