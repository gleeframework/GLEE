"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position.  $105 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $110. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we settle at $108?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
