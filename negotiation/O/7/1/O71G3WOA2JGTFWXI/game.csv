"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $12,000. This offer reflects its worth and is a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $12,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $9,500 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
