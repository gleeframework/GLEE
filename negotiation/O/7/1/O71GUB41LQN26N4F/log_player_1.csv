Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's slightly higher than what I consider the minimum acceptable offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit above my minimum acceptable value.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potential rejection."
