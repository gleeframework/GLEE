"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely do better.  You know the product is only worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
