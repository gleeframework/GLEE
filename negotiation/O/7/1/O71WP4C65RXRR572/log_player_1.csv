{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are not moving towards my desired price. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
