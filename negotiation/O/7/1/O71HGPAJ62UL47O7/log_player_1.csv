Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is far too low. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm counteroffering with $180. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping Bob will see that my initial offer was fair and that he's willing to pay a bit more to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if he'll go any higher.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's also willing to pay $150, I'll choose to sell to John.  It's a guaranteed sale, and there's no risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price."
