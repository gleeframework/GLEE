"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,500, which would be $11,250. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower to $11,000. Can we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,,
