Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Knowing it's worth a significant amount to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a win-win opportunity for both of us.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Time Value:**  While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, selling to Bob quickly is advantageous.
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys value and positions the offer as mutually beneficial. 

This offer balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit from Bob while retaining the security of John's offer."
