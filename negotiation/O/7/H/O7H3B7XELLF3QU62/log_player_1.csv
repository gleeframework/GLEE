Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable and I know you'll be impressed with what it can do. I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob's value is lower, starting near your minimum acceptable price anchors the negotiation high.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than what John is offering.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly stating why it's so high. This allows Bob to potentially justify a higher price in his own mind. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and are willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer. If you need to sell the product quickly, a price closer to John's offer might be more suitable."
