"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $5,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This would be a good price for both of us, and we could finalize the sale quickly.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a compromise, Alice, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair offer considering John's offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your effort.  However, $7,000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",8500.0,Alice,5,
