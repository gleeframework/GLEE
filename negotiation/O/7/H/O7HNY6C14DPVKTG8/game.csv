"I understand that $850000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850000.

"I'm surprised you're willing to go that low, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I can offer it to you for $812500. This is the last concession I'm willing to make. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go as low as $780000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options.",780000.0,Bob,10,
