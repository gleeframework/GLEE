{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $1,450,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and focused on the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to maximize profit. By starting at a higher price, I can potentially negotiate down to a price closer to $1,500,000 while still securing a better deal than selling to John.  

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and counteroffers, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Negotiation is key:**  I'm not ready to accept his offer. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,450,000.
* I will keep in mind Bob's financial constraints and the value of the product to him, while still trying to secure a profitable deal for myself.
