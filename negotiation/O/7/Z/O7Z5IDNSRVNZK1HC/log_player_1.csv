"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, as I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. I'm also leaving room for a counteroffer from Bob, as I don't know his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is far too low.  I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that price.  I'll counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to make sure I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can sell the product to John for $15,000. I'll counter with a price closer to that, hoping to reach a deal with Bob before I lose my chance to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm countering with $16,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and closer to Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$13,000 is still not ideal, but we are getting closer.  We've only got four rounds left, so I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob.  I'm still holding out for a better price, but I'm prepared to make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's latest offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm countering with $14,500.  This is a compromise that's only $500 away from John's offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price. We only have a few rounds left and I want to close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John. We're down to the last two rounds, and I need to make it count!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering with $14,000. This is my final offer, and it's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above John's offer. If Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
