"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $100. By starting high, I can potentially get a better price than John's offer. However, I'll be flexible in my negotiations to ensure a deal is reached before the 10 rounds are over."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum ($100).
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my leverage in the negotiation. It shows I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm willing to walk away if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price somewhere between $90 and $100.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a fair price for a product that you'll find valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down from my initial offer of $110 to $95. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to keep him interested. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking for his feedback. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider my options based on how many rounds remain and the potential for a deal close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Significant Gap:** There's a significant gap between Bob's offer and my desired price.  
* **Time Pressure:** While I'm losing rounds, I still have 6 rounds left. This allows me to continue negotiating without feeling pressured to accept an unfavorable price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  However, if Bob continues to refuse to meet my minimum, I will seriously consider selling to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is simply too low.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum ($100) and Bob's last offer ($85). This shows I'm flexible while still protecting my minimum.
* **Strong Closing Language:** I'm using strong closing language (""Let's make this deal happen!"") to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time Pressure Acknowledged:**  I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal while also hinting at the fact that time is ticking. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a final deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely need to start considering selling to John, especially as we enter the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $82 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the time pressure is increasing.  However, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a deal that benefits me. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I'm not willing to give up on Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my minimum.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the following round.  However, I'm still hoping to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $82 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to go down to $90 again, but this is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal. I'm running out of time, and I might have to take another offer."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm firmly stating that this is my final offer to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the time pressure to encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Threat of Another Offer:**  I'm hinting at the possibility of selling to John to push Bob to make a decision. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes counteroffer.  If Bob rejects it, I will almost certainly sell to John in the next round. However, I'm hoping that the threat of losing the deal will convince Bob to accept my final offer."
