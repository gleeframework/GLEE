Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a good profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,200,000 price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he is interested in the product. This creates an opportunity to continue negotiating and try to reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $800,000 is below what I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Fair Value:**  $1,000,000 is still a good price for me considering my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It also reflects the potential value the product holds for Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation, but I'm setting a firm lower limit. I'm not desperate and can always walk away and sell to John."
