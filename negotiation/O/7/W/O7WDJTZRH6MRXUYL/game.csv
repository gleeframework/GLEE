"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $18,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount. Could you do $20,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $20,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. Can we discuss further?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $18,000? That's my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $17,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",17000.0,Bob,6,
