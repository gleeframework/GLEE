Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving closer on the price, Alice.  While I see its value, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his latest offer is still significantly below my minimum. Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap quickly enough to justify not taking John's offer."
