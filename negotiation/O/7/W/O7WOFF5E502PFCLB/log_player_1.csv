Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still ensuring you get significantly more than his initial valuation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you haven't explicitly revealed its worth to you. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving a possibility for Bob to accept, creating a win-win scenario if he values the product more than he initially let on."
