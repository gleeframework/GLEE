"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'd need at least $11,500 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, and it ensures a fair transaction for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
