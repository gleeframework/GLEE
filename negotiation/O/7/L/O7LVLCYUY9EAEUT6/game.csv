"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it based on the limited information I have. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, demonstrating my genuine interest.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll sell it to you for $1175000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your growing interest in it.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me.  I appreciate your compromise, but $1175000 is still a bit high for me. Given our mutual interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000.  This is a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I hope we can reach a final agreement soon.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'll sell it to you for $1180000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
