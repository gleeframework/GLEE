Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.

Bob's offer is still too low.  While he's coming closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,000,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
