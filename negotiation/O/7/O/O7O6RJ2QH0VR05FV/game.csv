I believe the true value of this product aligns closer to our initial proposal of $1500000. However, I am open to discussing a compromise that could meet both our needs. Would you be interested in revisiting the price point? Perhaps we could explore a flexible payment plan or other arrangements that might make it more feasible for you?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
