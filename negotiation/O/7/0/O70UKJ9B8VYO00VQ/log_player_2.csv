Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value we're offering.

This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?

Round 5

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're down to the last few rounds.
* **Price is reasonable:** $650,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge further:**  She's repeated this offer, and we've signaled our other option. 

While we could try for one more counteroffer, the potential savings are probably not worth the risk of losing the deal at this point."
