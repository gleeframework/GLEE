Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), giving me room to negotiate.
* It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), leaving some room for compromise.

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being willing to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and potentially make a new one.  However, I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John, which limits my risk of settling for too low of a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to take a slight risk and try to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still leaves some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price to $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aims for a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer is also higher than Bob's valuation of the product, so there is still a chance he might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but is still too far off. At this point, I'm confident that I can secure a better price from John. The potential risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the possibility of a lower price.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the uncertainty of more negotiation rounds."
