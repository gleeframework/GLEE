"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and your profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that $900,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
