"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. How about $900,000? That's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $887,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",887500.0,Alice,5,
