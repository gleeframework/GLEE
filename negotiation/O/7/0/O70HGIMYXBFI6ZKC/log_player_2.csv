"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's worth $1,200,000 to me. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,250,000 for the product. This price is still a good value for you considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the value I place on the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to close the deal without either of us losing money. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
