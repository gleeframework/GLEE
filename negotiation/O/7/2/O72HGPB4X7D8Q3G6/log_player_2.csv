"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1200001. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's worth and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,200,000 than to accept Alice's offer of $1,200,001.  Even if we could negotiate down further with Alice, there's no guarantee we'd get it for less than $1,200,000, and the risk of a prolonged negotiation isn't worth the potential savings of $1."
