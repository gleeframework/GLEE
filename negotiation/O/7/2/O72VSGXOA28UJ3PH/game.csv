"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $950,000. Let's settle on $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
