"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for this item. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9000 is still slightly out of my range, I would like to propose an offer of $8500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value and my budget constraints.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $8250. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
