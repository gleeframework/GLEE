"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can do better! While $12,000 isn't a terrible price, you know John will sell it to you for $10,000. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in further negotiations."
