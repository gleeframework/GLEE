"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value:**  Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, but offering $1,300,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Your goal is to save money:** You want to pay as little as possible. 
* **John's price is your limit:** You have a backup option of buying for $1,500,000. 

**Next Steps:** By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  The counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, showing you are serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is still above Alice's value,  giving her incentive to negotiate.
* **Avoids ""too low"" offers:**  A lower offer might make Alice walk away, and you don't want to risk losing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Alice is willing to meet you halfway, which is a good sign. 
* **Getting closer to your target:** $1,150,000 is still within your budget, and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting and counteroffering again might lead to further negotiations, but it could also risk Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting this offer is the most strategic decision at this point. You are getting a good deal while minimizing the risk of a negotiation breakdown."
