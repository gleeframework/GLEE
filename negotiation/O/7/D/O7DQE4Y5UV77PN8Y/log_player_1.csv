Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down while still keeping us comfortably above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, making the price more palatable.
* **Alternative Option:** While we don't mention John directly, the fact that we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives us leverage.

This strategy aims for a high initial offer, hoping Bob recognizes the value and accepts. If he negotiates, we have room to maneuver while ensuring a profitable outcome."
