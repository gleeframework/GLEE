"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear and Concise Message:** I'm keeping the message short and to the point, focusing on the value proposition for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for flexibility in future rounds.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I want him to feel like he has a chance to get a good deal without feeling like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.**  It's significantly below the product's worth to me and my minimum acceptable price.
* **I have room to negotiate.** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **More negotiation rounds are available.** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price.

**Next Step:**  I will counter Bob's offer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering your value for the product and my minimum requirements. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower, but Still Profitable Price:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer and profitable for me.
* **Highlighting Value & Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise. This can help encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  I'm not going all-in with this counteroffer, allowing for further discussion if needed. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground where both Bob and I can feel like we're getting a good deal. By offering a price that's a compromise, I'm hoping to avoid going through too many more rounds of negotiation and secure a sale closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I could do $950,000.  That's a substantial increase from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I'm confident in my ability to negotiate a better price.** I have multiple rounds left and can continue to counteroffer, aiming for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a secure option.** While I want to maximize my profits, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed deal.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob again in Round 5, hoping to push the price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:**  I'm still trying to get a better price from Bob, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous counteroffer and Bob's current offer. This shows I'm taking his position seriously and trying to find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Value and Compromise:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him and highlighting the concession I'm making to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that by offering a price that is more reasonable and showing a willingness to compromise, I can convince Bob to accept the offer and avoid having to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,025,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my desired range, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,500,000.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.**  With 4 rounds left, I still have time to try and get a better deal from Bob.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John and get my minimum price.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob again in Round 7, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I will try to be firm but still show some flexibility in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a significant offer, considering the value you place on this product. Let's finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,025,000). This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product, highlighting that $1,150,000 is a fair price for him.
* **Urgency:** I'm using a phrase like ""finalize this deal"" to suggest that this is my final offer and I'm ready to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal. I'm also setting the stage for a potential final round of negotiations if he rejects it, allowing me to either accept his final counteroffer or sell to John if needed."
