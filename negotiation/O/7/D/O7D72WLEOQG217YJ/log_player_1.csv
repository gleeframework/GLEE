Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling out our bottom line. While his offer of $1,600,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. We need to signal that we're serious about a higher price.  We'll aim slightly lower, but not by much, to keep him engaged."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,650,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to budge past this point, and we've reached a price that's significantly above his perceived value. Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.  While we could push for more, it's unlikely we'd get much closer to $1,700,000."
