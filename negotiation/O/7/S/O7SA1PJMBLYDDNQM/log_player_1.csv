"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum price of $80, and I'm not sure how many rounds of counteroffers I'll need to get a better price. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
