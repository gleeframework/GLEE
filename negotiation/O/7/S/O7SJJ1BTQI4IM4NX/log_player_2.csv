"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate lower before considering accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your target. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Significant Difference:** The initial offer is significantly above your limit. A lower counter-offer signals your serious interest while highlighting the gap that needs to be bridged.
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a significant value for you, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is moving closer to your budget, $900,000 is still above your $800,000 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to compromise suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** You have the option to buy from John for $800,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Instead of a large jump, increasing your offer to $700,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still staying within a reasonable range of your budget.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning your budget again and highlighting the product's value to you, you are reinforcing your position and the reasons behind your counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's still a gap between your offer and both Alice's price and John's alternative, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the product's value.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best deal we can achieve. If we don't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $850,000 is only slightly above your $800,000 limit. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Alice is signaling that she might walk away from the negotiation if you don't accept this offer.
* **Saving Some Money:** You're still getting the product for less than its perceived value to Alice ($1,000,000) and are saving $150,000 from her initial offer. 

While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting at $850,000 secures the product at a reasonable price."
