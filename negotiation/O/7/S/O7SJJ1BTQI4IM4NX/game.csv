"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a significant value for you, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the product's value.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best deal we can achieve. If we don't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
