{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it has potential. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $825,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can do $810,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly moving towards a more reasonable price. However, she's still above your absolute limit, and your fallback option (John) will sell you the product for less. There's little point in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
