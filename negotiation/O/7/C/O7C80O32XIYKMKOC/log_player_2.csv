"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's significantly closer to your maximum budget ($1,500,000) than her minimum desired price ($800,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating.** This gives you more control over the process and potentially a better outcome."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating your seriousness about getting a better price. However, it's still above her minimum desired price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for further rounds of counteroffers if Alice doesn't accept the initial counteroffer."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Further negotiations could get you a better price.** You can likely push her down a bit more. 
* **Buying from John is still an option if the negotiation fails.** You have a fallback plan, so you can take some risks with the negotiation."

This is a fair offer that is closer to both of our desired prices. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
