Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $700,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this item.

# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be frugal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.
