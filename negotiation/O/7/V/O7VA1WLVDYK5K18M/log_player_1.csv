"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, considering the product's value to me. I'm confident that I can get a better price, even if it takes a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I want, $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating, and I'm not desperate to sell. I'm also considering selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer to Bob. I'm willing to accept $10,000, which is the value of the product to me.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for him as well. If he rejects it, I will sell the product to John for the same price."
