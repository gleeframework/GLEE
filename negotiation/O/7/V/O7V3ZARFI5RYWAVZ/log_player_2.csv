"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to get a deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to your $15,000 limit."
