{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Above Bob's value:** It's above what Bob values the product at, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Below your minimum:**  It's significantly lower than your minimum, giving Bob room to negotiate.
* **Motivates negotiation:** It creates a clear starting point for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to counteroffer.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to get a better price than John's offer while still leaving room to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and close the gap before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a better price.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourage Bob to come up a bit more.
* **Still above my minimum:**  It's important to keep my minimum in mind and ensure I don't get too far below it.

This counteroffer hopefully puts us closer to a deal while keeping me in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too far below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can bridge the gap.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  If we can't agree, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

This is a calculated move:

* **Final Offer:**  By stating it's my ""final offer"", I'm putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Small Concession:**  $1,025,000 is only $50,000 higher than Bob's last offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Close to Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum price, but close enough that I can potentially accept if necessary.

This counteroffer aims to make Bob realize he's close to a deal, but if he rejects, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no further. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $1,500,000."
