{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to start high to see what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 16500}

I'm going to counteroffer with $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.  We're getting close to a deal, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $1,500 below my minimum.  I'm worried that if I reject, he'll walk away, and I'll be stuck selling to John for $12,000.  It's better to secure a sale at $13,500 than risk getting nothing at all."
