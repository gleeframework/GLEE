Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is structured to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for him to counter-offer. This helps you understand how much he values the product and how high you can go."
