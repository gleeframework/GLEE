{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and encouraging Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle on $92?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $92 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, but it's still above my minimum and a fair compromise.  It's better to sell now than to risk losing him completely and having to sell to John for less."
