We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob.  We're above my minimum with John, and I think I can get Bob closer to $900,000."

While I could push for more, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're now at a price significantly higher than John's offer.  Accepting $875,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
