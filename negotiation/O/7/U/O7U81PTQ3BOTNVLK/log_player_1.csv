Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $900,000 starts the negotiation closer to my desired price point. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob can encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering that Bob might be willing to pay more than $800,000. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation space:**  While I could potentially accept Bob's offer, I believe there is still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Exploring counteroffers:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price, while still keeping John's offer as a safety net. 

**Next Move:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,000,000, but still below John's offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000, considering your interest in the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value it will bring you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  $880,000 is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This price is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm again highlighting the value the product offers to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully assess my options.  I'll need to consider whether it's more beneficial to accept his previous offer of $850,000, or to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
