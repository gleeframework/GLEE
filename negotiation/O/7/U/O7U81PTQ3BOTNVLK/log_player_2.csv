Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $850000 is still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $880000, considering your interest in the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value it will bring you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.

While you can still try to negotiate further, Alice has come down to $880,000, which is within your budget. Accepting this offer is the best choice, as it's only slightly more than what you'd pay John and saves you the hassle of further negotiation."
