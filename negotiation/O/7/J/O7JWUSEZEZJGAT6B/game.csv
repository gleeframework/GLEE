"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, I'm looking to invest in this product at a slightly lower price point.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
