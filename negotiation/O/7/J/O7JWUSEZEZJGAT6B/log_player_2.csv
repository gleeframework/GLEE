"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and a counteroffer will allow him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, I'm looking to invest in this product at a slightly lower price point.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from her original $1,200,000 price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a purchase at a lower price than John's and allows Bob to secure the product."
