Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter if he wants to. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in case Bob rejects the offer and the negotiations go south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested. This opens up the possibility of a counteroffer that could potentially get me closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** If negotiations with Bob don't work out, I have John as a guaranteed buyer who will pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130?  That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  By offering to meet halfway, I demonstrate that I'm trying to be fair.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing that this is a good deal for both of us could make Bob more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my offer. However, I'm still unable to go above $120 for the product. Would you be open to meeting me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below it. 
* **Risk of Going Lower:** Further negotiation could lead to me accepting a price even lower than $125.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:**  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing a safe and profitable sale.  

I'm choosing to sell to John because the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential of getting a slightly higher price. John's offer is my safety net, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
