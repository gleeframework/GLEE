Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is only slightly below my initial offer, and it's still above the $100 minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
