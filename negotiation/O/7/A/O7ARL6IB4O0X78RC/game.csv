"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I would prefer to stay within my budget, I am willing to consider $925,000 as a counteroffer. This allows us to move closer to a mutually agreeable price while still keeping my financial constraints in mind.",925000.0,Bob,4,
