Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **High but Appealing:** $14,999 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" while leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** You have the security of John's offer, so there's less pressure to accept a low price from Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible price from Bob."
