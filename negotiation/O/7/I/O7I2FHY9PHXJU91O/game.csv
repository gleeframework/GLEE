"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects my understanding of its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still think it's a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I have to be honest, $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a considerable investment from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
