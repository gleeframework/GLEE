"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a great price.  Would you be interested in buying it for $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $125 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150.  You save money and get the product by accepting."
