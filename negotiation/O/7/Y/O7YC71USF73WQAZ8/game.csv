"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
