"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss it further. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to purchase it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
