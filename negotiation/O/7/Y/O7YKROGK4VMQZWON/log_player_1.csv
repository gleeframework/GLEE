"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a high starting point for negotiation and leaves room for concessions if needed. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for more. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm confident I can secure a better price through negotiation.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a considerable amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Since I'm already in round 4, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit."
