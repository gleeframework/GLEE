"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the value of the product to me, I am unable to agree to $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down a little further and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
