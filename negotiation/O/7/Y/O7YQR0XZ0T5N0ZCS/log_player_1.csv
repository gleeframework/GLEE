{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my profit while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the value of the product to me, I am unable to agree to $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is still a good amount of money, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down a little further and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
