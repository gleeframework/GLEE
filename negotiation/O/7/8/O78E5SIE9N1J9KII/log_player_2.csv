"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still significantly lower than his maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's closer to his desired price point. While there might be potential for further negotiation, accepting this offer ensures a good deal without the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price."
