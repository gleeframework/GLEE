"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
