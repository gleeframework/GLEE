"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, and I know it has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This feels like a fair price, considering the value this product holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see you're willing to meet me a bit closer to a fair price. How about we settle at $1,065,000 and close this deal?",1065000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,065,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,072,500? This would be a mutually beneficial outcome, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product for you. Let's close this deal.",1072500.0,Alice,5,
