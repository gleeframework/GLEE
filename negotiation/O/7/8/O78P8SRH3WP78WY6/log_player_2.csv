Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This feels like a fair price, considering the value this product holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,065,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,072,500? This would be a mutually beneficial outcome, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,072,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,072,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly skilled at bargaining and moving in small increments.  At this point, the difference between her offer ($1,072,500) and our ideal price (closer to $1,050,000) is relatively small compared to the risk of the negotiation breaking down. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk having to pay the full $1,200,000 to John later."
