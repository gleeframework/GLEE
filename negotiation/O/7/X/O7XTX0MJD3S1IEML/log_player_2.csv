"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While $14,000 represents the value I see in it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,250 is closer to his target, it's still above the product's value to Alice.  There's more room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However, $13,250 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now. Let's try $13,000. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
