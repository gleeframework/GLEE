"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing I can adjust if needed. This also allows for some room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $150. How about $155?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to make a sale,  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this.  $130 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. How about $140? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. There are only 4 rounds left, and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more time to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $145. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $135 for the product. This is my final offer. If you can't accept, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the game and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. Even though I could make a counteroffer, I'm not confident he will accept it. With only two rounds left, I'm better off selling to John for $150. This ensures I meet my minimum profit and avoids any further risk of a lower sale."
