Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise while still aiming for my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  While $11,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $10,000, I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for me to profit.  I believe this price is reasonable given Bob's willingness to go up to $11,000, and it keeps me closer to my target of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $11,200.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value and represents a significant profit compared to Bob's initial valuation.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, as John is always a viable option for a guaranteed $12,000."
