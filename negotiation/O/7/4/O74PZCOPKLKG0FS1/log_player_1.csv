Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 (John).

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive could lead to Bob rejecting the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair given its potential benefits to you. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the value proposition can make Bob more receptive. 
* **No Mention of John:** Never reveal your backup plan (selling to John). This weakens your negotiating position. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate based on your assessment of his willingness to walk away."
