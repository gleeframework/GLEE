"Alice, your initial offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a competitive offer, reflecting the unique advantages this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
