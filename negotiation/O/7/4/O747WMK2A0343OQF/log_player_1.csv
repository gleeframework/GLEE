Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him for $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price that's still lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a little more. How about $15,000? This reflects the quality and value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. It's better to secure a sale at $13,500 than to potentially end up with nothing."
