"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to sell to John, hoping to get a better deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is also high enough to leave room for negotiation without compromising my minimum value. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000, which is the price John is willing to pay. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I have 9 rounds remaining.  There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob or potentially negotiate a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourages further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Midpoint:**  $1,075,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000).
* **Fairness and Value:** The message emphasizes that this price is fair to both parties and still recognizes the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. Looking forward to your feedback. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are only in Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing out on this deal and having to start over with John.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Although I'm accepting the offer, I can still try to negotiate a higher price in the future if I have the opportunity (for example, if there are further rounds of negotiation or if Bob needs the product urgently)."
