"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price.  Let's discuss a figure that benefits both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate and leave some room for you to counter-offer. Her opening price is exactly halfway between what she values it at ($1,000,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000). By rejecting her first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, increasing the likelihood she'll come down further in price. 

While you could buy from John for $1,500,000, there's a good chance you can get a better price from Alice with a bit of negotiation."
