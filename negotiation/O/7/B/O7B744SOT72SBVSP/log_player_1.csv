"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $85, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $92.50, which would be $88.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I want to make this work. However, $88.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $90? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below what I need to make a decent profit.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm risking losing too much time and potentially getting stuck with a low price. It's better to sell to John and ensure a good return on my product."
