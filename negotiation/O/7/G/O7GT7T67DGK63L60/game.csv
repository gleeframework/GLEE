"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a fair price considering your target.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $15,000. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price given the value I see in the product and it's a significant step closer to my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $14,500. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's the best we can do.",14500.0,Alice,5,
