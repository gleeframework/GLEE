"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your initial offer, but $1,200,000 is closer to the product's true value.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
