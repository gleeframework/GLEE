Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it just below this ensures you're maximizing potential profit from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the price is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer. You can then decide if a slightly lower price is acceptable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup guarantees you won't go below your minimum price. This strengthens your position.

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had that information, you could tailor your offer more precisely."
