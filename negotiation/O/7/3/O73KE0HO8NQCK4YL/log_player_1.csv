Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the discounted price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more if Bob accepts a price higher than that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below your minimum ($11,500) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob. He gets a $500 discount from your public price, while you still earn a significant profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John."
