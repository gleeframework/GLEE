Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than my minimum value:**  I'm still making a profit of $30.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value:** Bob gets a good deal, saving $10.

This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while still securing a decent profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently fall back on John's offer of $80."
