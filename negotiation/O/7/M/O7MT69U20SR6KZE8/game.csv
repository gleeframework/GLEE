"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to facilitate this deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference and go with $825,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
