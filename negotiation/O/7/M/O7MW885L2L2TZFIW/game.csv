"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to settle at $950,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
