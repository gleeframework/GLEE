"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $75 yet. I'll meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $85. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up slightly, but $85 is still a bit much for me. How about we finalize the deal at $80? That's the best I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already met you at $85 and you're now offering $80. I'm not willing to go below $90, so let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $87.50?",87.5,Alice,7,
