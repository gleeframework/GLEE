Round 5
Alice's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up slightly, but $85 is still a bit much for me. How about we finalize the deal at $80? That's the best I can do."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already met you at $85 and you're now offering $80. I'm not willing to go below $90, so let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $85 and has even explicitly stated she won't go below $90. You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, so there's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
