"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value and ensures we both benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
