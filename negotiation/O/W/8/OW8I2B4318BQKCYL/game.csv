"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",8500.0,Alice,5,
