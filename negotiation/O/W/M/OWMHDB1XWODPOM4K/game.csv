"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a comfortable price point. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a substantial difference from what I believe is a fair valuation. To meet you halfway, I propose a final offer of $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
