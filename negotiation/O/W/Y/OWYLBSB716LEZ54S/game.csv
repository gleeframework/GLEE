"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1250000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. If that works for you, we can finalize the deal. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1100000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1250000 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1175000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1175000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $1137500.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us and would let us conclude this negotiation.",1137500.0,Bob,6,
