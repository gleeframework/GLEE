"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that reflects its value and our potential long-term partnership. My initial offer is $1,100,000. This price is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price acknowledges your budget while still ensuring a profitable deal for me. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $975,000 is still too far from where we need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and our potential future business.  Let's reach a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground. Your offer is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000, but this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $990,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $1,007,500. Can you consider this price?",1007500.0,Bob,8,
