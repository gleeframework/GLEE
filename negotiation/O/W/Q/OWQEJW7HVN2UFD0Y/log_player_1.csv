Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,300,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This accounts for the value it brings while still being a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000.  It's the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob seems firm on his valuation, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap between his offer and the product's worth to me. It's time to move on to John, who's offering a price that reflects the product's true value."
