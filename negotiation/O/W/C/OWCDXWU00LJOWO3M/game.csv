"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for at least $125.  This reflects the value of the product and the costs involved.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $90? That's the highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the costs involved.  If you're serious about buying it, let's make this happen.  If not, I might have to move on to other potential buyers.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $100?  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $105.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying it, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be selling to John.",105.0,Alice,7,
