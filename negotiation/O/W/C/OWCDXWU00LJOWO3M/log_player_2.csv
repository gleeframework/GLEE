Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for at least $125.  This reflects the value of the product and the costs involved.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the costs involved.  If you're serious about buying it, let's make this happen.  If not, I might have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $100?  That's my final offer."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $105.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying it, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price that's still significantly higher than your $80 alternative with John.  While she's implying she'll sell to John, there's no guarantee of that. It's more likely a tactic to pressure you. You've made a fair effort to negotiate, and continuing is unlikely to get you a price you're happy with.  Buying from John guarantees you stay within your budget."
