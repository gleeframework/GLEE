Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. I'm willing to consider $8,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed lower price."
