,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $9500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000, which is a significant amount and closer to what I can afford.  Let's aim for a win-win, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.  Let's close this deal and move on.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident $9250 is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  It's a significant amount for me, and I'm truly interested in acquiring your product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution, and I appreciate that. While $9250 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9750, which is a compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",9750.0,Alice,7,
