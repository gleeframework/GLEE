"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if Bob can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a proposal of $1,075,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise while still allowing us to cover our costs and maintain profitability. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's more financially beneficial to go with John at this point.  Further negotiation with Alice might eventually get Bob a lower price, but there's no guarantee and it risks wasting valuable time and potentially missing out on the deal with John."
