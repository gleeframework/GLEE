"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $12,000. Given its worth to you is estimated at $8,000, I propose we find a mutually beneficial solution. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price that respects both our interests? Perhaps a negotiation could lead to an agreement that satisfies both parties. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility for further negotiation or can simply proceed to buy from John at your desired price."
