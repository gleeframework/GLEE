Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $95, which is closer to your $80 limit. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from her. Accepting her offer is the best option to save time and still get a good price."
