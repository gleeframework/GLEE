"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to make this deal happen.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12800.0,Alice,5,
