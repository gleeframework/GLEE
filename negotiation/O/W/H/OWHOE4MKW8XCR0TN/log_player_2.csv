"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly or buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I could do $6,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my maximum budget ($8,000) and Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite but clearly communicates that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to either get Alice closer to my target price range or quickly determine if buying from John is a better option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $9,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay, especially knowing I can get it for $8,000 from John. It's worth negotiating one more time, but I'm prepared to walk away and go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still stretching my budget. I can do $7,000, and I think that's a very fair offer.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer to $7,000, showing willingness to compromise but staying below my $8,000 limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I want to convey that my offer is firm and I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't accept.
* **Final Attempt:** This is my last attempt to negotiate with Alice. If she doesn't accept, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below my maximum budget.  While I could try another counter-offer, there's no guarantee she'll budge further, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy it at $8,000 from John.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
