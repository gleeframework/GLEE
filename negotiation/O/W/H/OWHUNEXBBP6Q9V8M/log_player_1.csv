Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate without you feeling like you're losing too much.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **It includes a positive message:** This makes Bob feel good about the offer, even if it's not his ideal price. 

By offering $115, you are hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It's important to be prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but you also have the option to walk away and sell to John if you feel the negotiation isn't going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:**  You've lowered your price from $115 to $110, showing flexibility.
* **Remains above your minimum:** $110 is still above your $120 minimum, so you're not losing money.
* **Uses positive language:** The message emphasizes fairness and the value of the product, keeping the negotiation positive.

This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $108.  Let's split the difference and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is closer to your minimum, it's still below it.  You're better off continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your desired price.  You still have the option to sell to John for $120, so you're not taking a huge risk by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a small compromise:**  You've only lowered your price by $1 from your previous offer, showing that you're serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Is still above your minimum:**  $109 is above your $120 minimum, so you're still getting a profit.
* **Is presented as a final offer:** The message suggests that this is your best offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the deal without having to sell to John.  It is a small compromise but still protects your interests."
