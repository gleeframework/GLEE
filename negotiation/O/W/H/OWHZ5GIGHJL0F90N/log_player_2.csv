"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  The product's value is significantly higher than $950,000, and I'm confident in its worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000? This would be a great deal for you, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Given the product's value, I can only accept a price of $1,150,000. This is a very fair price considering the quality and benefits it offers.  I hope you'll agree that this is a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!
