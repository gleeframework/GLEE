"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  The product's value is significantly higher than $950,000, and I'm confident in its worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000? This would be a great deal for you, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Given the product's value, I can only accept a price of $1,150,000. This is a very fair price considering the quality and benefits it offers.  I hope you'll agree that this is a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,5,
