{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I am confident that I can earn more than $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate to secure the deal. 

**Next steps:** 

* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my next offer accordingly.
* If negotiations stall or go below my minimum, I'll switch to John, who guarantees my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price, but I prefer to explore further negotiation with Bob first.

**Next step:** 

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  The product's value is significantly higher than $950,000, and I'm confident in its worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000? This would be a great deal for you, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:** $1,100,000 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's high value, subtly reminding Bob that a lower price would be unfair.
* **Positive framing:** I present the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, focusing on his potential benefit.

**Next steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, the deal is closed.
* **Further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the proximity to my minimum price.
* **Fallback option:** If the negotiation stalls, John remains my guaranteed safety net at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Closing the gap:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **John is a reliable alternative:** Selling to John guarantees my desired price and minimizes risk.

**Next step:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum or explore selling to John if a deal can't be reached."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Given the product's value, I can only accept a price of $1,150,000. This is a very fair price considering the quality and benefits it offers.  I hope you'll agree that this is a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Reasoning and emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's value and justify my price point to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Positive framing:** I present the offer as a ""good compromise"" and emphasize finalizing the deal.

**Next steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, the deal is closed.
* **Fallback option:** If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000, as further negotiation seems unlikely to achieve my desired outcome."
