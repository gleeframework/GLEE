It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $110.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept it."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John."

I'm going to offer Alice $85. This is still less than what I'm willing to pay John, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. If she rejects this, I'm going to buy from John."
