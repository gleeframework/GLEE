"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is asking for $115. This is too close to your limit, and there's room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $115 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
