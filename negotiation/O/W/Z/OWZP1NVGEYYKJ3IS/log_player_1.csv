Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit with Bob:** While you have John as a guaranteed buyer, your goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a price higher than $1,000,000 (his perceived value) allows for potential profit beyond John's offer.
* **Finding a Sweet Spot:** The price of $1,150,000 is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation but leaves room for bargaining and still nets you a considerable profit. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning the ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly nudge Bob to consider the deal seriously before you potentially move on to other buyers (like John). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
