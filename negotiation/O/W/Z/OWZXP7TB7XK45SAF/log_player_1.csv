Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it presents a great value at this price and would hate for you to miss out."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my fallback price incentivizes Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, potentially allowing me to still secure a deal above $10,000. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, avoids potential delays associated with selling to John."
