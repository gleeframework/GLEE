{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit to $18,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 18000}

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While $16,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we settle at $17,250? I believe that reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $17,250. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $17,000, Bob seems firm on his maximum price. Accepting his offer of $16,000 is a better outcome than potentially getting stuck with a lower offer or ending up with John's $15,000."
