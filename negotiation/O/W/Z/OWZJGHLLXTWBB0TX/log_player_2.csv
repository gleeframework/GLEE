"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'd pay $9,500 from Alice vs. $10,000 from John.
* **You save money by accepting Alice's offer.**  You're still getting the product for less than your maximum price of $10,000."
