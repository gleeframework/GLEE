Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,500,000 (your product's value to you).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You hold a strong position. You have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price. Therefore, you should aim high with Bob, leaving some room for negotiation but not going below your minimum.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm offering it at $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum. This gives you negotiating room.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message implies the product's value and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message doesn't sound like an ultimatum. This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement above your minimum.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! You've maximized your profit.
* **Bob Counters:** You can negotiate down towards your $1,500,000 minimum.  
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem. You sell to John at your guaranteed price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could start with a slightly lower price if you prefer a quicker negotiation, but never go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
