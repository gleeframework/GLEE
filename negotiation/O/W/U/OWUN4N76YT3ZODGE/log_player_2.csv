"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000. While this is less than what you'd pay John, you can still do better by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with her further. You have leverage because you have a backup option with John."
