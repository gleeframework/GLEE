{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **50% Markup:** A starting price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for potential negotiation while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in the offered price, aiming to influence Bob's perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), you can adjust your initial offer and message accordingly.
* **Market Context:**  While not provided, factors like the product's uniqueness or demand within its market can impact pricing strategies. 

This offer represents a strong starting point, aiming to secure the highest possible profit while acknowledging the presence of a backup buyer."
