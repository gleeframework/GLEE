{""product_price"": 7000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $11,000. This is still a significant discount from Alice's current offer, but getting closer to my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and secure a price that works for both of us."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is not budging much, and her offer is still above my budget. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000. It guarantees a purchase within my budget and avoids further negotiation that may be unproductive."
