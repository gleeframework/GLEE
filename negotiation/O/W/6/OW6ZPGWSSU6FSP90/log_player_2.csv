"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal at $140. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He values the product at $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still within his budget and likely within Alice's acceptable range. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also showing that he's serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $135. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $135 is a good deal considering Bob's maximum budget is $150.  Accepting the offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John and secures the product."
