"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a fair price of $7,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price.  He has 9 rounds left, and  he can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you consider $6,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $6,800. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, and $6,800 is still above his desired price point. He can potentially get an even lower price by continuing to negotiate. He has 7 rounds left before having to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $6,800 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $6,600? This is a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a good price."", ""product_price"": 6600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $6,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already successfully negotiated a price down from $7,000 to $6,900.  While he may want to go lower,  Alice has made it clear that $6,900 is her lowest offer.  He has 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee he'll be able to get a lower price. Buying from Alice at $6,900 is still a good deal compared to John's $8,000."
