"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum price.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's valuation as possible.  A starting offer of $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. This also leaves room for some back and forth before reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his valuation of the product. Accepting this offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John, and allows for a faster conclusion to the negotiation.  While there's a possibility of further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John or going through multiple rounds of counteroffers is not worth the potential for a small additional discount."
