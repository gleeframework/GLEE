"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $950,000 is still too close to your maximum.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You have 10 rounds, which gives you room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have the option to buy from John.  This gives you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how close she is to her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You are still within your budget and have John as a backup option, giving you strong leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a reduction from her previous price, it's still above your desired price point. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You're making progress; Alice is lowering her price, indicating she's open to negotiation.
* **More room to lower the price:** You have several rounds left, and there's still potential to get a lower price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you continue to exert pressure on her to come down further, and you still have the option to buy from John if the negotiations fall apart."

* **Testing for a deal:** This offer is close enough to Alice's last offer that she might be inclined to accept. It gives you a good chance of closing the deal in this round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price point, but it's still above your target.
* **Potential for a better price:**  You've made significant progress in negotiations and have 5 rounds left. There's a good chance you can push Alice down further.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You have John as a backup option, which allows you to be more assertive in your negotiations with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you continue to pressure her to come down further, and you can use your leverage to secure a more favorable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway again:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you're willing to be flexible while still pushing for a better price.
* **Closing the gap:** This offer is only $10,000 away from Alice's last offer, making it more likely that she'll accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You're still within your budget and have John as a backup option, giving you strong leverage in the negotiation.

This is a calculated risk. If Alice rejects this offer, you have fewer rounds left and may need to consider buying from John. However, the potential savings of $10,000 make this a worthwhile risk."
