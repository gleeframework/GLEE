Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I am interested in purchasing it for $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $16,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this stage, Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price range. While I could push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $16,000 ensures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely by going to another round."
