"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $8,500?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $8,400. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",8400.0,Alice,5,
