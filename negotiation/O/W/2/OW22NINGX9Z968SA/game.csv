"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
