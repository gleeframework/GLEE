Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's potential valuation:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm suggesting a price of $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation but keeps Alice close to maximizing her profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and offering it before a public listing implies scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Open for Discussion:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation open. Bob might accept outright, or it could lead to a counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher (closer to $12,000) to leave more room for bargaining.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be a bit more flexible on price to avoid going to John."
