"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option to achieve Bob's goal."
