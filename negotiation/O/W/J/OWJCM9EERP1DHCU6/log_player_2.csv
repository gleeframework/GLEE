Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider $10,200, which is a small increase from your last offer. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. It's not the $10,000 I was hoping for, but $10,200 is a reasonable deal and beats John's price."
