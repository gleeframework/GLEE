Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $10000. Would you consider lowering the price to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (1) Accept Bob's offer.
