Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,450,000. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for a limited time at $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** The message starts by mentioning a high value ($1,450,000) to set an anchor in Bob's mind, making the final price seem more attractive.
* **Scarcity:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message highlights the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly reinforcing why it's worth a significant investment for Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  While aiming to maximize profit, Alice understands that pricing too close to John's offer ($1,500,000) might deter Bob. By offering a price of $1,400,000:
    * Alice ensures a substantial profit margin above her minimum ($1,500,000).
    * Bob gets a good deal below his perceived value ($1,000,000) and saves $100,000.

This strategy attempts to make the offer appealing to Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
