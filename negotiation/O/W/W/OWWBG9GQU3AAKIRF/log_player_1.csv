{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum price:** This makes it attractive to Bob.
* **It's still above your product's value to him:**  Leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you are willing to negotiate:**  This encourages Bob to respond.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if you feel the negotiations aren't going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you want. It's better to try to negotiate a bit more and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired selling price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is too low.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you've already gone down significantly from your initial price. John is offering your desired price, making it the best choice to secure your desired value for the product."
