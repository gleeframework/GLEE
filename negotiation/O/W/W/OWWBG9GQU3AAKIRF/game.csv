"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired selling price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
