"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a fallback option (John) at $1,000,000, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price.  This is a reasonable starting point, demonstrating my interest in the product while also setting a clear expectation of wanting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is only $50,000 more than my counteroffer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer again and potentially increasing the price is high. Accepting this offer guarantees me a price that is $150,000 lower than John's offer, making it the most financially beneficial choice."
