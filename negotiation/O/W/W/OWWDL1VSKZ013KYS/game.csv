,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product but would like to offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can meet your price of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $175. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $175 is still a bit high for me. How about $125?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm now offering the product to you for $150, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",150.0,Alice,5,
