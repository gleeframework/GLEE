"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for the product.  I'm happy to pay $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering your cost and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer. I'm confident that the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $875,000? This would give you a good return and is closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,
