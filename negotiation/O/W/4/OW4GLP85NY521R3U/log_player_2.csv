"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  $900,000 is still above your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for the product.  I'm happy to pay $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering your cost and my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer. I'm confident that the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your target price, it's still a bit higher than you want to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $875,000? This would give you a good return and is closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Alice's offer for $925,000 is the best choice.  It's still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might get you a slightly lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving you with no product and forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
