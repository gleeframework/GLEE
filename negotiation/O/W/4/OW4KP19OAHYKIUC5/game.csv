"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last offers?  Would you be willing to do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a slightly higher price, $825,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $800,000 is about as high as I'm willing to go.  If you're open to that, I think we have a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
