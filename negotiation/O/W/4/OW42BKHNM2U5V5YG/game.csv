"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $15000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $15000 is significantly below the value I've placed on it. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a compromise that allows me to still gain a decent return, while also offering you a good deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with an offer of $16500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and what other sellers are asking.",16500.0,Bob,4,
