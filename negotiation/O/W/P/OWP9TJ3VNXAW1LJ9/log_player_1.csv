Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully it's attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $82.5 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Since he's been persistent in negotiations and it's likely I won't get a better offer from him, it's time to accept his offer and secure a sale."
