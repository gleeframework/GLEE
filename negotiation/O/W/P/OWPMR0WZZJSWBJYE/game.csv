"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're looking for, while also being fair to me.",11500.0,Alice,3,
