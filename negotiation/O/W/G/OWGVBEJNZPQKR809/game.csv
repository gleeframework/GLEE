"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $8,750? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I believe the product is worth it, $8,750 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,250?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",8250.0,Bob,4,
