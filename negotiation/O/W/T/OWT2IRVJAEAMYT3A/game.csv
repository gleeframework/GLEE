"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it in the long run.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is a good compromise, considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000 just yet. I can offer you a price of $10,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",10750.0,Alice,7,
