Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting high ($925,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return"" emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Backup plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for $800,000. This minimizes risk while maximizing potential profit."
