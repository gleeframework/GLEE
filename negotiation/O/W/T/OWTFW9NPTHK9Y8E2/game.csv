"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's condition, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to be closer to my budget. How about $11,500? Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, though. How about $12,750? It's still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference - how about $12,250? It's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
