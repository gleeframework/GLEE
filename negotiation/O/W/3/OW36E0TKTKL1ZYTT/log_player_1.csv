Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I value the product at no less than $1,200,000, I'll make a slightly higher offer to see if Bob is interested.

{""product_price"": $1,500,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a significant amount. I'll consider my options.

Since I value the product at no less than $1,200,000, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000. It's too low.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, making a counteroffer to try to get a better price.
