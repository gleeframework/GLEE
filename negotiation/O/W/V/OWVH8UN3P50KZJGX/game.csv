"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
