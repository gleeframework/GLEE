"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is still above my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
