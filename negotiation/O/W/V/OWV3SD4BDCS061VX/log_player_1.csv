Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal for a product I know you'll find incredibly beneficial."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price with John creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is $1,100,000, starting high leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing my minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome by balancing Bob's perceived value with my desired profit margin."
