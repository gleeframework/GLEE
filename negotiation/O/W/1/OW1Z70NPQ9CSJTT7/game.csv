"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's inherent worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to the value I see in this product. Let's try to find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
