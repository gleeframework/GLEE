"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to achieve our goals.  I hope you'll consider my offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
