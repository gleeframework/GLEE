Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000.  Aiming for a price between these values maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Psychology:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, even though it's still very favorable for you. 
 
**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation tactics beyond his valuation of the product."
