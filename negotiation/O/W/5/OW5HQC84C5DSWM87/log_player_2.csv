Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make a decision, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,500. It's the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at that price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has gone back up to her original offer of $9,500 and is unwilling to budge. It seems unlikely she will go below $9,000 at this point. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation, potentially ending up with a price closer to John's offer or even missing out on the product entirely. Buying from John for $12,000 is the safest option now to ensure you get the product."
