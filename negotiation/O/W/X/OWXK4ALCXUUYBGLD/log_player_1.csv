{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of the backup option with John, so I'm willing to walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly has some interest and is willing to pay more than his initial value. 
* **Plan B is Still Available:**  Selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a counter-price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer,  highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing a fair deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm still aware of the option to sell to John, which allows me to be assertive in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on the product, and I'd be happy to pay $9,500. This is a fair price, and hopefully, we can close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer than previous offers, it's not enough to justify selling the product at this point.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly very interested in the product and has raised his offer. This suggests that there's a chance we can reach a price that works for both of us.
* **Plan B is Safe:** Selling to John for $15,000 remains a secure option.  This gives me the leverage to hold firm in my negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I think we can finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and his offer of $9,500. This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Finality:** I'm hinting at finality (""finalize the deal"") to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm still aware of the option to sell to John, which allows me to be assertive but not overly aggressive in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility in negotiating. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I would like to get.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiations, and Bob's offer isn't increasing substantially. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Plan B is the Best Option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option available. It ensures I reach my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome.

Given these factors, selling to John is the most sensible decision to maximize my earnings."
