"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's desired maximum of $1,000,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I still think the product's value is significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still above his target.  Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price given the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still higher than $1,000,000.  With limited rounds remaining, Bob has to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate against the certainty of getting the product from John for his desired price.  Since Bob is only willing to pay up to $1,000,000, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
