"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price given the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
