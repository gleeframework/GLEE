Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,500. What do you think?"",
  ""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but suggestive, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation and the security of a backup buyer."
