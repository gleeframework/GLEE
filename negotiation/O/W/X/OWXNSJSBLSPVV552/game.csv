"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a fair price. How about we settle at $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $125 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
