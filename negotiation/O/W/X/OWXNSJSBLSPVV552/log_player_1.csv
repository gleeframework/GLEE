Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $125 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer of $100 would mean a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $150.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
