"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than $600,000. I could consider coming down to $950,000. This offer still reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $950,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $725,000 is too low. How about we settle at $850,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
