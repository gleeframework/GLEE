"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is way above your budget, so it's definitely worth rejecting.  You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point, and you can always adjust it depending on Alice's reaction.  It's a significant drop from her offer, but still within the realm of possibility given your $120 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price. You still have room to maneuver, and there's a chance Alice will budge with a bit more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

This counteroffer is a bit more aggressive, but still leaves some wiggle room for both of you.  It's a reasonable attempt to find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, it's still not ideal. You can try to negotiate one more time to see if you can reach a deal closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

This is a final attempt to get a good price. It's only $5 above your budget, but you can still try to convince Alice. You can try to appeal to her desire to get the product sold, as you're the only buyer at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting close to your budget, but it's still $10 more than you are willing to pay. You can get the same product from John for $120, which is within your budget. It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and get the product from John."
