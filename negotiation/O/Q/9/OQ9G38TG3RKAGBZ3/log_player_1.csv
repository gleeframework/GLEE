Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000, the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives him an opportunity to accept if he's willing to pay my minimum price, but also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to offer less.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffer isn't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to drop below $12,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that is still profitable for me, but also appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent price, it's still not as good as selling to John for $12,000.  I'm willing to walk away from this deal and secure the higher price."
