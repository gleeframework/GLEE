,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $125 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $128. Let's make this happen.  Is this something you can work with?",128.0,Alice,5,
