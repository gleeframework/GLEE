{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $127 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk a continued negotiation that may not result in a price I'm comfortable with."
