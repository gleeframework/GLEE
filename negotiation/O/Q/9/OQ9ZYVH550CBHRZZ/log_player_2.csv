"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a lower price than the product's value to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to come down in price, $950,000 is still above my budget. It's not clear if she's willing to go lower. To avoid further negotiation and potentially a higher price, it's best to go with John's offer of $800,000."
