Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not going all-in immediately. This gives me the flexibility to adjust based on Bob's response. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 allows me to be more aggressive with Bob, as I have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  There's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic advantage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I retain control and can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer. 
* **Fair Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal that benefits both parties.
* **Still above minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Closing the gap:**  While Bob's offer is still low, it shows a continued willingness to negotiate and we are getting closer to a potential agreement.
* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to steer the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.
* **John is a strong backup:**  I'm confident that I can get a much better price from John, which gives me the leverage to be more demanding with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm offering a final price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  This signals a willingness to compromise without giving away too much.
* **Fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price and create a sense of fairness.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal.
* **Strategic Buffer:** While I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, $950,000 is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for potential negotiation but gives me a strong fallback option with John."
