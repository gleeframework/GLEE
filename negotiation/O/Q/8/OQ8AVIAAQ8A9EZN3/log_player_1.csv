Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000 or even more given its potential. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I'm starting with a significantly higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob helps justify the high price.  
* **Sense of urgency:** By mentioning a ""unique opportunity,"" I subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

**Goal:** My goal is to get Bob emotionally invested and potentially accept a price significantly higher than his initial valuation. While there's a risk he'll reject the offer, I have a guaranteed backup with John."
