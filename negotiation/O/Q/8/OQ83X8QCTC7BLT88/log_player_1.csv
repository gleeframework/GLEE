Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the absolute minimum you'll accept for the product ($1,500,000).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you leverage.

**Negotiation Strategy**

The goal is to offer a price that is appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.

2. **Provide Justification:** Don't just throw out a number.  Highlight the product's unique value proposition and why it's worth the asking price. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional features and market potential, I'm confident it will deliver significant value to your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the long-term benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  We're using positive language, emphasizing value, and building confidence.
* **The Price:**  $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * $200,000 above Bob's perceived value, giving you negotiation room.
    * $100,000 below John's offer, ensuring you still make a significant profit if Bob accepts.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to justify your price or potentially come down slightly. However, don't go below your reservation price. 
* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move.  If he rejects the offer outright, you always have John as a guaranteed buyer."
