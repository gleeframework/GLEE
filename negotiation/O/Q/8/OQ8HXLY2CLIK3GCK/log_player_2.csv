"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds an intrinsic value of $12,000 to you. However, to ensure a fair transaction, I propose a price of $11,000 for this remarkable item. This offer not only provides you with significant savings but also secures a high-quality asset that aligns with your needs. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can bring this opportunity to fruition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you. While her offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down closer to her own product valuation of $10,000."
