"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to still get a decent return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're firm on $8,500.  Let's try one last compromise before I consider other options.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,6,
