Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I've carefully considered its worth to you, and I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Avoid a Counter Offer:** By proposing $925,000, I aim to secure a price significantly above my minimum ($800,000) while still enticing Bob with a perceived ""discount.""
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can rely on John to buy it for my minimum acceptable price."
