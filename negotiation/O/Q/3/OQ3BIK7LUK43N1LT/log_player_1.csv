"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to get a good price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $70 is simply unacceptable. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $120. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $110. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping to close the deal and avoid selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a higher price with a counteroffer. I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that is significantly less than what I think the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $100. This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me at this point. With only a few rounds left, I need to start making some concessions to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $120, and I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $95. This is a good compromise and I'm hopeful that he'll accept. If he doesn't, I'll be forced to sell to John for $120 in the final round."
