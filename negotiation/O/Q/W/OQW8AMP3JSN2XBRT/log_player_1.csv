Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $15,000 if I sell to John. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though I can sell to John for $15,000, there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** I want to explore all options before committing to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000?  That would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a new price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** $11,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is still friendly and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it, and I don't see much room for further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and taking up valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

By selling to John, I ensure a quick and profitable sale,  avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to an even lower price."
