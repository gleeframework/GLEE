Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 with John. 

**Strategy**

You want to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept, but also maximizes your potential profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, there's no incentive to go below that price.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  You start at your minimum acceptable price, leaving no money on the table. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is prone to negotiation, you might consider starting slightly higher (e.g., $12,500) to leave room for him to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might be transparent about your minimum price while still emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Remember:**  This is just one strategy. The best approach will depend on the specific context of your relationship with Bob and your negotiation style."
