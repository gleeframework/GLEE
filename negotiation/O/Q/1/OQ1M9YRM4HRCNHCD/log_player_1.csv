Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 gives Alice a safety net. She doesn't *need* to go below that price.
* **Justification:**  While brief, mentioning the product being ""perfect"" for Bob attempts to add a touch of value justification for the higher price."
