"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you say?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and go with $115.  This is my final offer, as I'm willing to purchase from John at $100 if we can't reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I can meet you at $120, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to selling to John at the original price",120.0,Alice,5,
