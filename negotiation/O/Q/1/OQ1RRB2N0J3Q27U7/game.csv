"Alice, $15,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price considering the benefits this product offers.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  $9,500 is my final offer.  It's a significant discount and a deal you won't find elsewhere.",9500.0,Alice,5,
