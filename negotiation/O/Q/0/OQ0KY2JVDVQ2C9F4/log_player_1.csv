Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $100.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully leads to a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John. I've already rejected Bob's lower offers twice, and it seems unlikely we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with. John's offer guarantees me $100, which is my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing more time on a negotiation that might not be successful."
