Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $9,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's above your minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the product's value and positions the price as a good deal. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start negotiations strong.** By setting a slightly higher price, you give yourself leverage.
* **Encourage Bob to negotiate.**  The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation, making him more likely to counteroffer.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John.**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on the $8,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value it holds, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum value.**  You're not losing anything by accepting.
* **Negotiating further might not be worth the effort.**  While you could try to get a higher price, there's no guarantee of success.
* **Selling to John is the same outcome.** You'd get the same amount of money.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure the sale quickly and avoid potential delays or further negotiations."
