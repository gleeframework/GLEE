"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can try to get a better price from Alice. $110 is still above your target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $107.50 is within your budget of $120.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a good price."
