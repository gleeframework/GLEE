"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Can you consider my revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $775,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to stay at $800,000.  This is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer. If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
