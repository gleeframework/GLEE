Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential for profit.
* **Positive and Engaging:** The message is friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a successful deal."
