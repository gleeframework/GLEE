"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings to your operation.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while giving you a great deal on this high-value asset.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
