"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $700000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $700000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $650000. I think this price is more reasonable, considering the value you've described. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to meet your needs. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm now offering the product to you for $720000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we may not be able to come to an agreement, so I want to emphasize that I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise further than this.",720000.0,Alice,5,

This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.
