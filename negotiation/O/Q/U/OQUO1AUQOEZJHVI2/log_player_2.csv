It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  You can always go with John as a backup."

I'm offering $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $15,000 to Alice and $10,000 to me. It gives her a good profit and saves me some money."

While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal price. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise while still getting a good deal for myself."

Alice is not budging much, and it's clear she's not willing to go lower than $13,500.  At this point, it's better to go with John and get the product for my desired price of $10,000."
