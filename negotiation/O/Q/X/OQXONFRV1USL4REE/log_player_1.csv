```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's value of the product ($800,000) but lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000).

* The message is friendly and encouraging, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get.
* I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference?

* I'm confident that this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob, as it's closer to his preferred price than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but no higher. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.
* I'm confident I can push for a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* The possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 still provides a safety net, giving me leverage to stand my ground."
