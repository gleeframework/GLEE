Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to increase your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness about purchasing the product. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and at this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,500,000 than risk Alice not budging further."
