"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering its worth to you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to increase your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness about purchasing the product. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
