Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism:

* **Ambitious:** The high price targets Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Realistic:** It acknowledges that Bob won't pay more than the product is worth to him.

By starting high and conveying a sense of urgency, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal closer to her desired price."
