Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold. I believe there's room for a better deal, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.
