"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to us at $1,200,000, reflecting its quality and uniqueness. Considering its worth to you at $1,000,000, I believe we can find common ground.
To make this acquisition possible, I propose a negotiation process. Let's aim for a fair compromise that respects both our interests. Please let me know if you're open to discussing terms that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is starting negotiations very high. While she acknowledges the product's value to you is lower, her offer is still significantly above your maximum.
* You have a strong alternative with John offering the product at your target price. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high and open the door for further negotiation. She might be willing to come down closer to your range to avoid losing the sale."
