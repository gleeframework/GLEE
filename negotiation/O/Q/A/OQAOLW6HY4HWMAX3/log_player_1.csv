Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price without immediately risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he may walk away entirely, or I may have to settle for selling to John for a significantly lower price.  I'm choosing to accept his offer and secure the sale."
