"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer the product for $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",900000.0,Alice,3,
