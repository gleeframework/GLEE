Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175. This is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer. It also emphasizes the perceived value of the product to build interest. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:** Starting high increases the chance of getting a price closer to my desired value.
* **Keep options open:** I can always lower the price if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **Show confidence:** A high starting price shows that I value the product and am confident in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $125 is better than his initial perceived value of $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 

I'm choosing to **reject** Bob's offer because:

* **I have a better alternative:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a higher profit. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a better price in the next round. 

My next move will be to counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $140. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my willingness to compromise, while also highlighting the product's value to justify the price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase the chances of a deal:** By showing flexibility, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Maintain control:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm still in a position of control, as the price is closer to my preferred value. 
* **Set the stage for a potential final offer:** If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to lower the price further or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could counteroffer again, it's unlikely Bob will go higher.

Given my current options:

* **Accept Bob's offer:** This would result in a loss for me, as I'm committed to earning at least $150.
* **Reject Bob's offer and counteroffer:** This could lead to a prolonged negotiation with an uncertain outcome.
* **Sell to John:** This guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $150.

Therefore, the best decision is to **SellToJhon**. It provides a sure profit and eliminates the risk and uncertainty of further negotiations."
