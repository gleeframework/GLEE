"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I can offer $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'd accept $1,350,000. This price is still very attractive for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to maintain a decent profit. Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer $1,320,000 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to the value I'm willing to pay as possible.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
