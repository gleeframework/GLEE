Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $95 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but not Greedy:** Offering a price too close to $100 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to rejection.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
