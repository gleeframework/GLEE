"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $75, it's a good deal.  There's no reason to risk a higher price or delay the purchase."
