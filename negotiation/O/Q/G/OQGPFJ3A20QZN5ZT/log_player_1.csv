Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
*  I am aiming for a higher price because Bob is an unknown buyer. I don't know his valuation of the product.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $1,200,000.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

This approach allows me to potentially maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a better deal."
