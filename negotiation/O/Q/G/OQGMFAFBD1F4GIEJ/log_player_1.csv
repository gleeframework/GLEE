Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to counter his offer if it's reasonable.  If he doesn't come close to my desired price, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not quite what I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer."
