"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still quite a stretch for me. I could consider going up to $700,000. This offer reflects my budget constraints while acknowledging the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to go up to $700,000. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time, I'll come down to $900,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,5,
