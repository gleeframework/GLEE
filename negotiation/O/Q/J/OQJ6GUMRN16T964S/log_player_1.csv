Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product.  I'm excited to discuss this opportunity with you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents fair value considering the unique benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it matches the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  Since I have another buyer (John) lined up at that price, it makes the most sense to sell to John directly. This avoids further negotiation and potential delays or complications."
