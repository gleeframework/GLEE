Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I can do $85, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than $85. We're already on Round 6, and the difference between his current offer and John's standing offer of $100 is getting smaller.  

It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
