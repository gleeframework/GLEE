"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a bit high for me, though.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value and our potential long-term relationship.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us and we can finalize this quickly.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $920,000, which is just a bit above the original price I mentioned. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.  It's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",890000.0,Bob,6,
