Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the value I believe it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $15,500 is lower than her previous offer, it's still more than Bob's budget.  He has already tried to negotiate, and he's reached a point where he's better off buying from John at a price he's comfortable with."
