{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $120 but below my minimum threshold of $150.  It gives Bob room to negotiate, but also ensures I don't sell it for too low.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price threshold of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $100 is just too low. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm flexible and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's perceived value of $120, but it's also closer to my minimum threshold of $150. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $115?  That's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If this doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm going to offer a final price of $120.  This is my best offer, and I really think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This is my final counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum threshold of $150.  I'm willing to go down to $120, but if Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
