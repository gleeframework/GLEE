"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm flexible and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $115?  That's a fair deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm going to offer a final price of $120.  This is my best offer, and I really think it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
