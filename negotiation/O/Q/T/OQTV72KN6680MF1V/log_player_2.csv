"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $2000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also within my budget, giving me some wiggle room if Alice counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still above my preferred price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. I want to avoid buying from John at $15,000 if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. This is a middle ground between our last two offers, and it leaves room for Alice to counter if needed.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target of $10,000, but I'm also trying to find a solution that might appeal to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is getting very close to my preferred price of $10,000. While it's not ideal, it's within my budget and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Accepting now means I save a significant amount compared to buying from John, and there's a chance I might be able to negotiate further down the line.  I'm willing to take the risk and accept this offer."
