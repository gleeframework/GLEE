Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,375,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping to achieve a price that reflects the product's true value.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price.  With only a few rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum price. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
