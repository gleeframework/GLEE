"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I think I can get a bit more. I'll see if I can convince him to go higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $87.50? Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's not ideal, but it's a better outcome than selling to John for $80. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
