"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but I'm only able to go up to $105 right now.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $108.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to what I can afford.",108.0,Bob,4,
