{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It offers a price slightly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation but also demonstrating your product's value.  I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but I'm only able to go up to $105 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $115. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $108.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to what I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum, and it seems like he's not willing to go any higher.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
