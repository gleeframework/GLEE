"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $8,200 is too close to my minimum and I can potentially do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,800? That's still a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? I really like the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $8,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's also important to close the deal and avoid further negotiation, as I'm not sure I can get a better price."
