Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, but we're still significantly away from our minimum acceptable price. We're only on round 4 of 10, so we have room to negotiate. By rejecting and countering, we maintain pressure and signal the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. To be fair, I'll come down slightly to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is my final offer, I signal seriousness and a limit to further concessions. 
* **Round Number:**  We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation. Putting a little more pressure now is strategic.
* **Psychology:**  The $1,000,000 mark is a psychological price point. It might be more appealing to Bob than a slightly lower figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my budget. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob hasn't significantly increased his offer despite my ""final offer"" statement. This suggests he's unwilling to meet my valuation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has diminishing returns. We risk leaving money on the table by not selling to John, who's offering a guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a round we're not finalizing the sale with John.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
