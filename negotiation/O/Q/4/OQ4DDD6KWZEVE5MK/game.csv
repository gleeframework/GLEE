"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $730,000? I think that's a fair offer.",730000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I understand you're trying to get the best price, $730,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $740,000. This way we both get a good deal and can finalize the transaction.",740000.0,Alice,5,
