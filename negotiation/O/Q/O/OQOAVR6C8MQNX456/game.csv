"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. I am willing to consider $9,000 as the price for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive in the market. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
