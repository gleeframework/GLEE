"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $110? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more than $80, but I'd like to get as close to that price as possible.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $125? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $110. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110. How about we try $117.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",117.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make one last offer: $110, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $80",110.0,Bob,8,
