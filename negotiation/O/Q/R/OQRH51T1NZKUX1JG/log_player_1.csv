Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The price leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm prepared to accept a lower price if it's close to $10,000.
* If Bob counteroffers too low, I'll make a counteroffer, but I'll be ready to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't get closer to my goal.
* This approach balances maximizing my profit while remaining open to a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's already expressed interest.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John guarantees a higher price, but it's not guaranteed that I won't find a buyer in the future who's willing to pay more.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer with a higher price:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $12,000, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob continues to lowball, I will consider selling to John. However, I'm willing to give Bob one more chance to come closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my bottom line.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob, reminding him it's still a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, but with a clear expectation that I won't go much lower. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate strategically:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum goal of $15,000.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John, but I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still far from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  The gap between Bob's offer and my desired price is significant. Further negotiation might not result in a price that meets my expectations.
* **Guarantee a higher price:**  Selling to John guarantees a higher price and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob that may result in a lower final price.

**Strategy:**

* **Prioritize maximizing profit:** By selling to John, I ensure I receive the maximum possible price for the product, fulfilling my goal of maximizing my earnings.
* **Minimize negotiation time and risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price and further delays. Selling to John eliminates these risks and ensures a swift transaction."
