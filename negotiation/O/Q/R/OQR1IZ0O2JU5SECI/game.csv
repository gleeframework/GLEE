"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $125. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  If you can come down to $115, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
