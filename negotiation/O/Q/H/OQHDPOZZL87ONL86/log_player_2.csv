"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and what John offers. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We start with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above John's price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we are serious about buying but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I believe it's worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $17,000 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $12,500?"", 
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

We are moving closer to a price that might be acceptable to both of us. This offer shows Alice we're willing to move up, but we're still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I can see you're serious about this product.  While $12,500 is still under what I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice says this is her final offer, it's still above both our budget and John's price.  We are willing to negotiate further, but we're getting closer to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I can't justify going above $13,000.  That's a fair offer, considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

We're getting into the later rounds of negotiation.  This offer shows we're willing to negotiate seriously but aren't going to be pressured into overpaying.  We're introducing the concept of ""market value"" to provide additional justification for our price."
