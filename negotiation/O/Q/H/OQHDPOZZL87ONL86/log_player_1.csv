Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I can't justify going above $13,000.  That's a fair offer, considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. He's consistently stayed below $15,000, and I've already stated my final offer to him. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
