"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I believe it's worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I can see you're serious about this product.  While $12,500 is still under what I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I can't justify going above $13,000.  That's a fair offer, considering the current market.",13000.0,Bob,6,
