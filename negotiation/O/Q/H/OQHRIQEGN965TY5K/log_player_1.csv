"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's value for the product. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little extra."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm countering with a price of $12,500. This is still below my ideal price but higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by meeting him halfway, he'll be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal at this point. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
