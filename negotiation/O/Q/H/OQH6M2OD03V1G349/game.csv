"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would give you a great deal, and allow me to make a reasonable profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $925,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $940,000.  Let's close this deal at that price, and we can both walk away happy.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I can only go up to $920,000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",920000.0,Bob,6,
