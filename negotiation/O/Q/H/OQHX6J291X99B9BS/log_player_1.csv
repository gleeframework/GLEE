We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum threshold.  However, I'm hesitant to accept his offer at this point, as I believe I could get a slightly better price if I had more time.  To avoid risking a deal falling through, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I receive a guaranteed price that meets my minimum requirement, even if it's not the best possible outcome."
