Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal. What do you say?

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming to get the price as close to $10,000 as possible."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, but that's my final offer.  Think about it -  it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice has met your bottom line.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John since you'll get the same price."
