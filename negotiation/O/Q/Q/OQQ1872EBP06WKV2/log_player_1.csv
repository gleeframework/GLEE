Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being patient. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $10,000 even? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob has reached his maximum price and is unlikely to go higher. 
* Accepting $10,000 is a $2,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* Continuing negotiations risks losing the sale entirely, pushing you to accept John's offer, which nets you only your minimum."
