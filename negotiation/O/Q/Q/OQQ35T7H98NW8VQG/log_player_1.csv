Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:
    * You earn $150,000 more than selling to John.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly without revealing your guaranteed offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you want to maximize profit and are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you prioritize a guaranteed sale over potentially higher profit, offering it to Bob at $1,200,000 would be the safer approach."
