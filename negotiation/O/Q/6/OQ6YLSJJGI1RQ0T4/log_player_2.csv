"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's making a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.
* **Fair price:** Bob is suggesting a price that is still above Alice's value for the product, suggesting he's willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer establishes a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate and making a counteroffer.
* **Value for Bob:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, and further negotiation could lead to a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, meeting Alice halfway.
* **Win-Win:**  Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's value, making it a potentially attractive deal for both parties.
* **Closing the deal:** By suggesting a compromise, Bob is aiming to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation rounds."
