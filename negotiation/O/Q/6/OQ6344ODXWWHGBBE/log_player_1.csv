{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $12,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, making it more likely he'll consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do at the moment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is better than $12,000, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
