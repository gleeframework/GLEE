Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $149. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since John will buy it at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit. 
* **High Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing Alice's minimum price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having a guaranteed sale to John as a backup."
