"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering our previous discussion, I would like to offer the product at $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target of $8,000, it's still a bit too high.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and hopefully close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I value your interest in our product and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I propose to sell the product to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, he's still within his negotiation rounds and can likely get a better price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, Bob can counter and hopefully get the price down to $9,500 or even closer to his $8,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,750 for the product. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given our discussions."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $9,875. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has a few things to consider:

* **Getting closer to his goal:** $9,875 is only $1,875 over his target of $8,000. This is a decent compromise, especially considering the limited rounds left.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects and tries to counteroffer again, there's a chance Alice will reject and the deal will fall apart.  He might end up having to buy from John at $8,000.
* **Time constraint:** Bob has only 3 rounds left.  Trying to negotiate further could be risky, especially if he's not sure Alice will budge. 

Considering these factors, accepting the offer at $9,875 is the most reasonable choice. It's a good price, and it ensures Bob gets the product without risking a failed negotiation."
