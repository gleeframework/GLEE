"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $115. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than what Bob considers the product to be worth.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his value of the product ($100) as possible. He's offering a price that's still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but might be within the realm of what she's willing to accept considering she values the product at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $105.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob is still within his budget and has multiple rounds left.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $110 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $108? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground by offering a price slightly higher than his initial counteroffer but still lower than Alice's most recent offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still trying to minimize his own cost."
