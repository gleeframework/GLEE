"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value allows for negotiation room. 
* **Realistic Expectation:** While $1,750,000 is still less than my minimum desired value, it's a starting point that allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer creates space for Bob to counter, encouraging further negotiation without immediately resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $1400000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:**  $1,400,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows his willingness to negotiate.  I have more rounds to explore potential compromises and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting the offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Within Range:**  My counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still below my desired price of $1,750,000, but it is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Middle Ground:** This price represents a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Clear Communication:** My message reiterates my willingness to work with Bob and highlights the potential benefits for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am glad we are getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $1550000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is exactly at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are nearing the middle of our 10 rounds, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While I could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer and I will be forced to sell to John for a lower price than I initially wanted.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed sale and a decent profit."
