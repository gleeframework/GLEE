,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $95 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. How about $105? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $102, but that's my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",102.0,Alice,5,
