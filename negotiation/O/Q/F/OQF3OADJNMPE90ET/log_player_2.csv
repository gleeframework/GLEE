# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's a lot of room for negotiation since Bob's maximum price is $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum is $1,200,000."

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is a good compromise - it's significantly lower than John's price, and Alice has come down from her initial offer."
