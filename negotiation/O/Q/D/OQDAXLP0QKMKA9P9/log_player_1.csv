Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for significantly less than what the product is worth to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This gives you a solid price point, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to me.

I'm still not ready to sell for that low. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $900,000 is still too far below what this product is truly worth. Let's split the difference: $975,000. This gives you a significant discount, but also allows me to get a reasonable return.  If you're serious about getting this product, I think this is our best chance to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we settle on $925,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

I'm not getting closer to my desired price and we're nearing the end of the negotiation. John is a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000, so I'll take that option."
