"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  Let's make this deal happen!",115.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $112? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $112 just doesn't work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $113. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love this product.",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $113 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $111? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",111.0,Bob,6,
