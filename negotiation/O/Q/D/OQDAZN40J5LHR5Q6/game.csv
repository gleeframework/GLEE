"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite steep. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? That's my maximum for this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
