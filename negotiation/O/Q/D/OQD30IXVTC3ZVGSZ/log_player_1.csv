Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $11,000. Since this is still below my target price of $15,000, I'll choose to reject his offer and send a counteroffer of my own.

I'll try to get closer to the target price by offering Bob a price of $13,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to the price Bob is willing to pay.
