Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $15,000. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $14,000?  That's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth it. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering your valuation of $15,000 and my maximum budget of $10,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to continue working with you. However, $11,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my preferred price, $13,000 is still above my budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  How about $12,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I really don't want to lose out on the opportunity to work with you. Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget.  While it's a good compromise, I've already had several rounds of negotiations and I'm running out of time.  To ensure I get the product within my budget and avoid further delays, I'll choose to buy from John for $10,000."
