Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob is interested in the product and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price higher than Bob's initial offer.  This should keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Although it's only slightly higher than my minimum value,  continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away or I'll end up selling to John for the same price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
