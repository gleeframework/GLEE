"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I open it up to other interested parties. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a much better deal from John."
