Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit higher than your original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $8,500. How about $9,250?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,000. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000 and saving yourself the further hassle."
