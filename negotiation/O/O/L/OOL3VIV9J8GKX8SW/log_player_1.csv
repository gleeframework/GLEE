"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I think I can still get more. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more.  We'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  Even though it's the same as his previous offer, I still think I can do better.  It seems like Bob is being stubborn, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll see if I can convince him to raise his offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $13,000. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to give in too easily. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. With only four rounds left, I'm starting to worry about running out of time, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $12,500.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to finally convince Bob to accept. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're running out of time, and $11,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather sell to Bob at that price than risk selling to John for $10,000.  It's a good deal considering how difficult the negotiation has been."
