"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000 even? That would make it much easier for me to commit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,250. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
