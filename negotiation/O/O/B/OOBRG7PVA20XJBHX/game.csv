"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is already a discount from its true value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. How about we settle at $900,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000, which is a compromise between my minimum and your offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  That's a significant price and I think it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I can offer you a slight discount to $1,025,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm finding it difficult to justify going over $1,000,000.  My final offer is $975,000. This leaves us both with a reasonable deal.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
