Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

This offer gives you a good chance of securing a higher price than John's offer, while still being attractive to Bob. 

Here's why:

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is lower than what the product is worth to him, making it a good deal. 
* **Good for you:**  You get more than John's offer, bringing you closer to your desired value.

Of course, there's always the chance Bob will reject the offer. But,  if he does, you have a guaranteed sale with John."
