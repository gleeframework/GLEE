"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I understand its value to you and am willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. My offer is $1,100,000. It's a price that allows me to earn a reasonable profit while still providing you with significant value. Consider this a win-win scenario. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price, saving you $100,000."
