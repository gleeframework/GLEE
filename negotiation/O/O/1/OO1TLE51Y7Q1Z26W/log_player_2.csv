"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a number that I think is fair, considering its value to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its market value."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer (but one that is still profitable for Alice) allows room for negotiation. It also establishes my position as a serious buyer but one who is looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While $900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I believe there's room for Alice to come down further, especially since my budget is reasonable compared to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and would be a beneficial deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious about buying, but not drastically. I'm sticking closer to my budget while still leaving room for some final negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you're placing on the product, I'm willing to reduce my price by another $50,000. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is very firm on $850,000, and while it's tempting, it's still above my absolute limit and a significant amount more than John's offer. At this stage, the potential savings from continuing the negotiation aren't worth the risk of Alice refusing to budge further.  I can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John."
