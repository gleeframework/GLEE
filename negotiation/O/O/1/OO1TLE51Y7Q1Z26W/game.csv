"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a number that I think is fair, considering its value to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and would be a beneficial deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you're placing on the product, I'm willing to reduce my price by another $50,000. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
