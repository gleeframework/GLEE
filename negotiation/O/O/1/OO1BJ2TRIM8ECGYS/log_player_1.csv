Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm sure you're aware of its potential, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will yield great returns for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I've used a friendly and persuasive tone, highlighting the value the product holds for Bob. I've also acknowledged the significant investment but emphasized the potential returns.
* **Product Price:** I'm offering the product at the maximum price knowing that if Bob rejects, I can still get $1,000,000 from John. 

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still being open to negotiation with Bob."
