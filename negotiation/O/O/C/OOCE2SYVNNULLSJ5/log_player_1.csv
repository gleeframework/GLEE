Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a price higher than John's offer, giving me the potential to earn more. 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Potential for profit:**  This price allows for a significant profit margin compared to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk mitigation:** While there's a chance Bob will reject the offer, I have a guaranteed fallback with John's offer. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Offering a higher price, but still below the perceived value of the product to me, might encourage Bob to negotiate.

By offering $1,500,000, I'm striking a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a safety net with John's offer."
