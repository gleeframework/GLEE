Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher than Bob's perceived $10,000, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Important:** While this is a starting point, be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects the offer, you can gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly to still secure a profit above your $15,000 minimum."
