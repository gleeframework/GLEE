"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum value, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $8000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $12,000. I will continue negotiations with Bob and see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing discussions, but $10,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which reflects the true value of the product.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your price. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $11000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price. I'm confident John will buy the product for $12,000, so I'll take his offer and avoid further negotiations."
