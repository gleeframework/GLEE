This counteroffer is a good starting point. It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but you're also not willing to pay her full asking price.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's risky to keep going back and forth, but you're closer to your goal than when you started. Let's try another counteroffer."

Alice is not budging much, and her offer is still too high for your budget. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. You'll save $70,000 compared to Alice's offer, and you'll have a product in your possession."
