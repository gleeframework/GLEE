"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and $10000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but $12000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14000?",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make one final push to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $17000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and my investment.",17000.0,Alice,7,
