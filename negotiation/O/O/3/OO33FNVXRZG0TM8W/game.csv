"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
