"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind.  How about $118?",118.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $118 is still a bit too low for me. How about $122?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let's close this deal.",122.0,Alice,5,
