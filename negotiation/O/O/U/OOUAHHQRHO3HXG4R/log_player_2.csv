"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding an arrangement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is simply not feasible for me right now. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My goal is to save as much money as possible.  By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price, I'm aiming to establish a negotiating range that's beneficial to me. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves considerable space for negotiation.  I'm prepared to increase my offer, but I want to see how Alice responds first.
* **John as Leverage:**  I always have the option of buying from John for $800,000. This gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more firm in my negotiations with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** Alice dropping from $2,000,000 to $1,300,000 shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still Too High:**  $1,300,000 is much closer to her value but still significantly above my $800,000 limit. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  I believe there's still room for her to come down further, especially with the knowledge that I have an alternative option."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm very interested in the product, but I need to be realistic about my spending."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:**  I'm moving significantly closer to her price to demonstrate that I'm serious about buying.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $900,000 represents a compromise, splitting the difference between her current offer and my maximum. 
* **Budget Justification:**  Mentioning my budget reinforces the idea of a limit while showing my desire for the product.
* **Keep John in Mind:**  I'm still well below my ""walk-away"" price, giving me leverage in case Alice is unwilling to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's try $1,100,000. I believe this offers a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice came down another $200,000, but the pace is too slow. We're still $300,000 away from my maximum, and $200,000 away from a price I'd consider reasonable.
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to remind Alice that I have a viable alternative.  Continuing to reject her offers puts subtle pressure on her to move closer to my price range.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While I'd be willing to pay a bit more than John's price, I believe there's still room for Alice to come down further."

{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000, but that's really the absolute limit I can justify. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase, Firm Limit:** Increasing by $50,000 shows good faith, but stating it's my ""absolute limit"" conveys urgency and firmness.
* **Encouraging a Decision:**  This counteroffer puts the ball in Alice's court. She can accept a price slightly above your ideal, or risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Alternative Still Viable:**  You haven't revealed your $800,000 fallback, keeping the pressure on Alice. This tactic maximizes your chances of getting the best possible deal from her."
