"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding an arrangement that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is simply not feasible for me right now. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm very interested in the product, but I need to be realistic about my spending.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's try $1,100,000. I believe this offers a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000, but that's really the absolute limit I can justify. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,6,
