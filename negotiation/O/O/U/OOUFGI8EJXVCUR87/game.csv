"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $105 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't quite go that low yet. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? I think that's a fair compromise.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
