"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of your product, $2000000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1250000.  This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's seal the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1280000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and potential returns.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1280000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go to $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential returns. Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1260000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and potential returns. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1260000.0,Alice,9,
