"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his ideal price.  He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really interested in your product, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. I think this is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is tempting, Bob is still within his budget to continue negotiating. He can try to push for a lower price.  It's worth seeing if he can get even closer to his goal of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $11,500. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has been trying to negotiate down, but Alice is stubborn. It's getting close to his budget, but it's still $4,500 over his ideal price.  At this point, it's more worthwhile to buy from John and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
