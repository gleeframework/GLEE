"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than Bob's maximum of $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling Bob's serious intent to negotiate.  $100 is still a good price for Bob, leaving room for potential compromise. It also leaves Alice with a profit margin, which could incentivize her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $115, which is a good compromise. Bob is still getting a good deal at this price, and there's a risk that if he rejects the offer again, Alice might not be willing to negotiate further or even increase the price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a stalemate or having to buy from John at a higher price."
