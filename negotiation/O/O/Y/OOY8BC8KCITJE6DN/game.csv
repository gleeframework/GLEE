"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering its value. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $1,100,000. Let's try $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. We're close, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a small step closer to your offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
