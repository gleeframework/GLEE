**Reasoning:** 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer and it's still $25,000 over your alternative purchase price with John. While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely Alice will move significantly closer to your ideal price. Accepting John's offer guarantees you the product and saves you money."
