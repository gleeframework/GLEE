Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $120, but it's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $120 and my initial offer of $150.  It's not a viable option for me.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm still not willing to go below my floor price.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $90 is better than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've already rejected his offer twice, and I don't want to risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower offer.  John is offering a guaranteed $120, which meets my minimum requirements.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
