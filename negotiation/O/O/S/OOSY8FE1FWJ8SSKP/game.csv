"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,225,000?  This is still a good deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be closer to your original asking price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,187,500.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to get a good deal.",1187500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,187,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but  I can't go lower than $1,206,250. This is a very fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you say?",1206250.0,Alice,5,
