Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safe $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a significantly larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $50,000 of its value to him), while still earning you a substantial sum above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly."
