# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to purchase from John at a much better price."
