Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000  to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find value at this price."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is a big drop from your initial offer, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $14,000 is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price that still offers you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to settle at $13,000? That would seal the deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go above $13,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's better to make a good deal now than risk getting stuck with the product or having to settle for John's offer later."
