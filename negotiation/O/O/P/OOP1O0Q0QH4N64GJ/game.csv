"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find value at this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is a big drop from your initial offer, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $14,000 is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price that still offers you a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to settle at $13,000? That would seal the deal for me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
