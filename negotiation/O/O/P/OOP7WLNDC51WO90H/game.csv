"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $85.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
