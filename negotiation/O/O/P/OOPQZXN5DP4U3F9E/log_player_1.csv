{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price. It offers Bob a seemingly small but enticing discount while still netting you a profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" adds a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
