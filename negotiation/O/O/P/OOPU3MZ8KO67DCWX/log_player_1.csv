"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not so high as to be immediately rejected.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. Bob's initial offer is too low, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and see if I can push for a higher price or potentially end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.  I'm hoping that we're close to a deal and this will be the price Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now too low, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and I've reached the point where I'm willing to accept John's offer of $80.  It's time to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John to ensure a guaranteed profit."
