Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $130 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $135?  It's a fair price, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $130 as the final offer for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not comfortable risking another round of negotiation that might end with a lower price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, making it the best option in this scenario."
