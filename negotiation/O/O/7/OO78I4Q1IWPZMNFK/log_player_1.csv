Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a great product, but I'm not sure it's worth the initial price you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price for this product. I'd be willing to consider $1,200,000, but I need to see some more movement from you. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price. While $1,225,000 is still significantly lower than our ideal price, we have room to negotiate and it's still significantly more than John's offer.  We'll continue to counter in hopes of reaching a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,225,000 is closer, but still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To show you I'm flexible, let's settle on $1,275,000.  This is a very fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,225,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly invested in negotiating and has met us exactly in the middle. While we could push for a slightly higher price, we're now at a point where the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward of a few thousand more. $1,250,000 is a strong profit, and accepting now ensures a successful sale."
