"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,450,000 to you. How about we start there?",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a great product, but I'm not sure it's worth the initial price you mentioned.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price for this product. I'd be willing to consider $1,200,000, but I need to see some more movement from you. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,225,000 is closer, but still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To show you I'm flexible, let's settle on $1,275,000.  This is a very fair offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,225,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can we discuss this further?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
