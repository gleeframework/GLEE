Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it hints at it with the phrase ""given its value.""  This subtly implies the price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying another buyer exists), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. 
* Observe Bob's reaction to gauge his interest and adjust your strategy accordingly in subsequent communication."
