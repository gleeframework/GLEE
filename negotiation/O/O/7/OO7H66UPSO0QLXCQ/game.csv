"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm proposing $9,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I need to get.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about buying this product, and I appreciate that. However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $9,100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm running out of time here, and I really want to make this work. I'm going to offer you the product for $9,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your urgency, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but that's as high as I can go. If you're willing to accept this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",8900.0,Bob,8,
