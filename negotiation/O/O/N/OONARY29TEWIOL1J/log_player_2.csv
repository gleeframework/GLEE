"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $9,500. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and a great price for me."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's a starting point that acknowledges Alice's value while also reflecting Bob's desire to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a competitive price for a product of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $9,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and he could end up paying John's higher price.  Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase at a reasonable price."
