"Round 1
Alice's offer:

You have three options:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $100 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $130. How about we discuss further?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming closer to my price, it's clear she's unlikely to go as low as John's $120 offer. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation rounds. I can get the product for my target price right now from John."
