Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is worthwhile.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a guaranteed sale to John."
