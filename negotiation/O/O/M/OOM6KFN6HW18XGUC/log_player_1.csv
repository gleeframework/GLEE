"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with some negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth $8,000 to both of us, and I'm willing to come down to $8,500. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you consider that?

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $8,000. This is a fair price for a product that's worth that much to both of us. Let's close this deal now before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $8,000, we're running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
