"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget of $800,000. It's too early to accept, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll start by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
