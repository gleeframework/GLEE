Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price might entice Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Even though I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures I get paid sooner.

By offering the product at $14,500, I aim to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
