"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to pay that amount to take it home.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $17500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. Let me know what you think!",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to pay that amount to take it home.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $16000, but I need to add a small premium to cover some additional costs. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16250. This is my final offer. Let me know if it's acceptable to you.",16250.0,Alice,5,
