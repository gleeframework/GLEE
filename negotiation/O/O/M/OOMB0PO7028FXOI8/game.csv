"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $825,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $815,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
