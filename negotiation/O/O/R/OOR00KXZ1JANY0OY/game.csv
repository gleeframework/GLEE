"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? ",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit above my budget with $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's try $100.  That's fair for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
