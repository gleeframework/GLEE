"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $15,000? I'm confident that the product will bring you a lot of value, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $15,000 is still outside his budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $15,000 is closer, it's still slightly more than I can manage. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer, $14,000 is still over his budget. He should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $13,500. I believe this is a good price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000, as we previously discussed. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $14,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Even though Alice is willing to negotiate, she's not getting close enough to his maximum price. He's already had 6 rounds of negotiation and the price is still too high.  He has limited rounds, and buying from John guarantees him the product at his maximum price."
