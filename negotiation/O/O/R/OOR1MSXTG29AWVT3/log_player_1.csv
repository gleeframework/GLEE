**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, I still have room to negotiate. We are in round 4 of 10, and I'm aiming to secure a price closer to $1.1 million.  I'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,080,000. While not ideal, this price is significantly above my minimum and provides a good profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
