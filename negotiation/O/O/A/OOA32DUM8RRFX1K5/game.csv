"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $825,000? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $780,000? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and I think this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,
