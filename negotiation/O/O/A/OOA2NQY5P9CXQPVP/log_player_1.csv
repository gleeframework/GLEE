Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Value:**  Knowing Bob values it at $800,000, offering it slightly above that won't work.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation (if Bob counters) while staying closer to Alice's desired price. 
* **John as Leverage:** Alice doesn't need to reveal she has another buyer, but the knowledge of that backup offer empowers her to aim high. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,100,000. He might counter-offer, or refuse outright. This strategy aims for the best possible outcome for Alice."
