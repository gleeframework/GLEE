"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  While the product is worth more to me than John's price, I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. By starting low, I aim to leave room for bargaining and hopefully reach a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is definitely too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's still a significant markup from John's offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $6,500.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between her current offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates willingness to compromise while still pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $6,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  That's a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my best alternative price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John since the price will be the same."
