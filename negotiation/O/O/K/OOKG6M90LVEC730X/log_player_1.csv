Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down. Even if he negotiates, you're still likely to get a better price than John's offer. 
* **High but not Unreasonable:** While $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), it's not so outrageous as to be immediately dismissed.  The message emphasizes the product's value, which might justify the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. You could start with a lower price and see if Bob counter-offers. There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright, but the potential reward of a higher sale price might be worth it in this scenario."
