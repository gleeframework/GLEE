Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $2,000,000. I believe its value is significantly higher than that, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and hopefully maximize my profit.
* **Acknowledging Value:** I mention the product's potential value to make it clear I'm not just throwing out a random number.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I clearly state that I'm open to negotiation,  signaling a willingness to work with Bob and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **No Immediate Fallback:** I'm not mentioning John at this point. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and how his negotiation tactics play out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  While Bob is interested, his initial counteroffer is significantly lower than my asking price.  This suggests there might be room for a higher counteroffer from him. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and show that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, reflecting my desire to reach an agreement with you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($2,000,000) and Bob's offer ($1,400,000), demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the Discount:**  I emphasize that this is a significant discount from my initial offer, reinforcing my desire to make a deal with Bob.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I'm inviting Bob to find common ground and potentially agree on a mutually acceptable price.
* **No Mention of John:** I'm still trying to secure the best possible deal with Bob without revealing my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and meet me halfway, indicating he's serious about buying the product.
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:**  If I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, I risk Bob walking away or further lowering his offer.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I have John's offer as a backup, ensuring I won't lose out on a good deal if I accept Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:**

Given the close proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum price and the potential for further negotiation complications, accepting his offer seems like the best option to secure a good deal and avoid potential delays or losses."
