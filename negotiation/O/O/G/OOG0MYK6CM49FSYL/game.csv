"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's fair to both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the same price I offered initially. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",11200.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,200. I'm ready to pay $11,000 for the product, which is my final offer. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll need to move on to another seller.",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,200, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at this price. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which is a $1,000 value. So, the effective price would be $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product.",10200.0,Alice,9,
