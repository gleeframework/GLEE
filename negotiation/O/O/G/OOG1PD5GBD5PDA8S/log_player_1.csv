Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's generally advisable to start with an offer above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchor Price:** By starting at $20,000, you establish a high anchor. Even if Bob doesn't agree to this price, it influences his perception of what a ""fair"" price might be.  
* **Leave Room for John:** It's crucial to remember you have a backup offer of $15,000. Your offers to Bob should reflect this alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's room to negotiate towards a price closer to your target. 
* **John as Leverage:** You still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $12,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to meet somewhere between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but  slightly closer to your side. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly remind Bob that your product is desirable and holds its worth. 
* **Leaving Negotiating Room:** While you've lowered your price, you're still leaving room for further negotiation if needed, while staying comfortably above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the market value, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Strong Offer:** While it's not the $17,000 you countered with, getting $14,000 is a good deal. It's a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Time Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has an opportunity cost. Accepting now secures the sale and allows you to move on."
