{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob while emphasizing the potential savings for him.
* **Keeping the option open:**  I'm ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects this initial offer. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me confidence to push for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:** Having John's offer as a fallback gives me the leverage to push for a more favorable deal with Bob."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm showing respect for Bob's position and acknowledging his offer.
