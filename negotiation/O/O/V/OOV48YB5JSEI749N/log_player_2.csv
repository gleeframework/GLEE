"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's much better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, rather than immediately accepting or buying from John. There are still 9 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This establishes my limit and forces Alice to either accept or start a counter-negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for my budget. There's room for further negotiation, and I want to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product but still keeping it well below Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is getting closer to my budget, I still think there's potential to negotiate lower. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice that I am serious about buying the product but still pushing for a lower price. This should encourage Alice to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,500 is getting closer, I still think there's potential for a lower price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  I still have time to negotiate further and avoid buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still pushing for a lower price. This shows Alice that I am serious about buying the product but not willing to overpay.  This should encourage Alice to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point.  With only three rounds left, I need to strike a balance between pushing for a lower price and avoiding a deal breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $15,200 is quite close to my desired price point, I am only one round away from my fallback option of buying from John for $8,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, I can potentially push for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down further. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but with only one round left, I have a chance to secure the product for a lower price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm still interested but also highlighting that this is my last attempt. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll go with John's offer. This is a last-minute push to get a better deal than my fallback option."
