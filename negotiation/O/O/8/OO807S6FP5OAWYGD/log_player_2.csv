# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price of $140. Given its value to you, this is an excellent opportunity to secure it at a reasonable discount. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than John's price of $150, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice with a counter-offer."
