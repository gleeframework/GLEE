"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is my best price, as I'm also considering other options. ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
