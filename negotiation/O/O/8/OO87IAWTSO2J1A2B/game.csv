"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my absolute final offer. I'm sure you understand that I have other options available to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
