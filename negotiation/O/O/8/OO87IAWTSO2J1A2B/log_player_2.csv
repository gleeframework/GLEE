"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, it's always wise to keep John's offer as a safety net. You can use John's offer as leverage to drive a better price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation and see if I can get her closer to my target price of $8,000. I can still buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my absolute final offer. I'm sure you understand that I have other options available to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's clear that she's not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's better to stop negotiating and buy the product from John for $8,000. This will ensure I get the product at a price I'm happy with and avoid further frustration with Alice."
