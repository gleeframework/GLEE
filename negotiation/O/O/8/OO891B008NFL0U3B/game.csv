"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,200,000 is below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle at $1,250,000? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
