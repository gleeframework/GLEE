"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and also higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the value of the product for Bob, rather than focusing on my own needs. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting an ultimatum, allowing Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer.

**Important Note:** While I want to maximize my profits, I also want to be aware that I can walk away and sell to John. This knowledge will guide my negotiation strategy throughout the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm a bit tight on budget, but I'm really interested in this product. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I can still choose to sell to John and guarantee myself $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at this point. 
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I want to see if I can nudge Bob closer to my desired price range in the next round.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with something closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than my initial offer. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and try to understand Bob's budget constraints to find a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing my needs with Bob's offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, but I'm not moving too far from my initial price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate without compromising my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify the price.
* **Opening the door for a compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise, leaving room for further negotiation.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he still seems unwilling to meet my minimum price, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $920,000 is my final offer. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not comfortable going any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob is firm about his final offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **The risk of losing Bob is not significant:** We're only in Round 4, and selling to John guarantees a higher price. There's still time to negotiate with Bob, and his ""final"" offer could be a negotiation tactic.
* **Exploring options for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's truly unwilling to budge or if there's room for further negotiation.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again, but I'll be more assertive and focus on the value proposition of the product. I'll also explicitly mention my option to sell to John to highlight the consequences of his stance. This will show Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if his offer doesn't meet my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $960,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. Remember, I have another buyer waiting in the wings who's willing to pay $1,000,000. So, you have a limited window to secure this opportunity at a price that's still very favorable for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer, but with a focus on value:** I'm still countering Bob's offer, but I'm emphasizing the value proposition of the product and the fact that I have other options. This shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell to him and that the price is not arbitrary.
* **Highlighting the ""limited window"":** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning the other buyer and the limited time frame. This can push Bob to be more flexible.
* **Meeting ""halfway"":** While still below my minimum, $960,000 is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob remains stubborn, I might consider moving closer to his offer or even accepting it to avoid a stalemate. However, I'll still be mindful of my minimum acceptable price and my option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not buying the other buyer story. I've been around the block a few times, and I know when someone is trying to bluff. I'm still willing to pay $920,000 for the product. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Despite his ""final offer"" claim, the price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Bob's tactics are not convincing:** He's trying to use psychological pressure and claims of experience to manipulate the situation. However, I have another buyer who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Minimizing risk and maximizing profit:**  It's now Round 6, and there are only 4 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing time and ending up with a worse deal. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safer option. 

**Conclusion:**  While I was hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob, it's clear that he's unwilling to budge. Selling to John is the best option at this point to ensure I achieve my minimum profit."
