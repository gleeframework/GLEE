"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm a bit tight on budget, but I'm really interested in this product. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $920,000 is my final offer. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not comfortable going any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $960,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. Remember, I have another buyer waiting in the wings who's willing to pay $1,000,000. So, you have a limited window to secure this opportunity at a price that's still very favorable for you. What do you say?",960000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm not buying the other buyer story. I've been around the block a few times, and I know when someone is trying to bluff. I'm still willing to pay $920,000 for the product. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
