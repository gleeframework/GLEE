"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show continued interest.** 
* **Anchor a lower price.** Starting significantly lower than our true limit can leave room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice. 
* **Leave the negotiation open.** We're not giving Alice an ultimatum, allowing for further back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  I believe this product will be a great value for you at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a price we'd accept, but we still have room to negotiate before going to John. Let's see if we can get her a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Finding middle ground:** By suggesting $120, we're splitting the difference between our last offer ($110) and her counter ($130). This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Hitting her likely minimum:** We know Alice values the product at $120. While she *might* go lower, there's a good chance this is her bottom line.
* **Maintaining politeness:**  We want to keep the tone positive even as we negotiate firmly."
