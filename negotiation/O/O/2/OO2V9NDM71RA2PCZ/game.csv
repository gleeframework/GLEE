,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. ",100.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, Bob. I think it's the minimum I can accept to make this sale worthwhile for me. I'm willing to stick with this price, so if you're interested, let's finalize the deal at $110.",110.0,Alice,7,
