"While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, but that's my absolute maximum.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'll throw in a sweetener: I'll include a free premium service package worth $50,000. This way, you'll get the product and some extra value for the price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
