Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'll throw in a sweetener: I'll include a free premium service package worth $50,000. This way, you'll get the product and some extra value for the price of $1,000,000.

Alice's offer is still more than I'm willing to spend.  While the sweetener is tempting, it's not enough to justify the extra cost. It's time to go with John's deal."
