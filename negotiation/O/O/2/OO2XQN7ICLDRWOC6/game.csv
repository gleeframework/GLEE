"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $1,550,000 is my final offer, considering the product's unique value. It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. Let's seal the deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
