"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting with a high offer ($2,000,000) gives me more room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the price as fair. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an invitation to discuss, signaling flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to establish a high starting point and test Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it sets the stage for a bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This opens an opportunity to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, but I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob first.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my position and make a counteroffer in the next round. This strategy aims to secure a higher price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Reduction:** I've dropped the price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to both of us, reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Focus on Common Ground:** The message encourages collaboration and finding a middle ground.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our initial positions. By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I aim to encourage him to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John open if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,400,000 is still $100,000 below my floor of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential to Negotiate Further:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to come up on his price.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** I can always secure $1,500,000 from John, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round. The potential for a better deal with Bob outweighs the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John at this stage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $1,550,000 is my final offer, considering the product's unique value. It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Compromise:**  I've come down to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 above Bob's last offer.  This shows a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate the product's value and its potential for Bob, making it clear that it's a good investment at this price.
* **Urgency:**  I've used phrases like ""final offer"" and ""seal the deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to tempt Bob into accepting, as it's a small step away from his last offer. It's a calculated risk, but if Bob is serious about acquiring the product, he may be willing to agree. I'm also still prepared to sell to John if this round doesn't result in a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean losing $200,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  We've already gone through several rounds, and Bob has remained firm on his price. It's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is above my minimum requirement and a safer bet.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiations with Bob is not worth the potential loss.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and avoids the possibility of getting stuck with a lower price."
