"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal.  He has a significant buffer ($300,000) between his maximum price and Alice's offer, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still well above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to push for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It is lower than his initial counteroffer and significantly less than buying from John.  At this point, further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to another buyer (or Alice simply refusing to negotiate further) outweighs the potential gain. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price within his budget and avoids the risk of a more expensive alternative."
