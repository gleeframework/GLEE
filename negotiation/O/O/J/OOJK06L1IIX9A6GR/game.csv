"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700000 is simply too low. It's a significant amount of money, but it doesn't even cover the potential for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $850000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $850000 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $775000.  However, I need to be at least $800000 to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $825000.  This is my final offer, as I don't want to waste any more of your time or mine.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $795000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",795000.0,Bob,8,
