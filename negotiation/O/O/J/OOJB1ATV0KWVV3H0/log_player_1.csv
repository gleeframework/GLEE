"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is above my minimum but leaves some room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's offer, but also gives Bob some wiggle room to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best price for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $12,000. This would still give you a good deal while ensuring I can make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $10,000 and close to my initial counter-offer.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd be left with John's offer of $10,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale completely."
