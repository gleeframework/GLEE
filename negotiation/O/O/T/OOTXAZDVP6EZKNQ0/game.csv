"I appreciate the offer, Alice, and I'm definitely interested in the product. However, $1200000 is right at my budget limit.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000? I believe this would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make the purchase work within my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that $1000000 is your budget limit. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,
