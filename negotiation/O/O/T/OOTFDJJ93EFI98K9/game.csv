"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value warrants a higher price. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you're placing on the product, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,425,000?  This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,425,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
