"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $11,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
