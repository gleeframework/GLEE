"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a piece valued at $10,000 by you, but with an additional incentive that could potentially save you some money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. In light of this, I propose a revised price of $11,000 for the product. This still represents a significant saving for you compared to its value, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer again gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue discussing this. Considering our previous negotiations, I'd like to propose a final offer of $10,875 for the product. This allows us to close the deal while ensuring you receive a fair price for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $10,875, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's highly unlikely Alice will go lower.  Therefore, the best option is to buy from John for $10,000 and save the extra $875."
