Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed sale price creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves me space to potentially negotiate down to a price still significantly above his perceived value.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that he could miss out if he doesn't act."
