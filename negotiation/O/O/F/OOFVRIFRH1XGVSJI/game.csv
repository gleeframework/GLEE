"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the concession, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. Considering the value of the product to you is $1000000, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1300000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. This would allow us to reach an agreement and avoid going back and forth further. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
