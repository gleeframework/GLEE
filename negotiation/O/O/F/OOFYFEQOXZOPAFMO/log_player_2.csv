"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product from John for $100.  Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's, but still above your maximum price of $100. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
