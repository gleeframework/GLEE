"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price given its value and the potential benefits it offers. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and ensures I don't immediately sell to John.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value and benefits of the product, making the offer more attractive to Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,500,000 for it. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is closer to my expectation, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,650,000? This leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive, focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for more negotiation in case Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can realistically offer at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my initial asking price of $1,750,000 and significantly higher than what I would get from John.  It's a good deal considering I've already had several rounds of negotiation.  I'm choosing to accept this offer."
