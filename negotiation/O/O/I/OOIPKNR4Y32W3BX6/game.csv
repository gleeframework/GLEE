"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $135. How about we try $142.50?",142.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the offer, but $142.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $142.50, which would be $138.75. Can you consider that?",138.75,Bob,4,
