"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to get the product for $120, I'm offering that price directly. This is your maximum budget, and it's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but it establishes your desired price point from the beginning."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above your budget of $120.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is unwilling to go down to $120, I'm offering $125 as a compromise. This is still within my budget and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also a significant decrease from Alice's previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much. Her offer of $145 is still too high for my budget.  With John offering the product for $120, it's more financially sound to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice. There are only 5 rounds left, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal with Alice."
