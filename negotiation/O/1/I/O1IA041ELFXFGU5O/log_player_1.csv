Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I understand it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,200,000. This reflects the value I've placed on the product while leaving room for negotiation.  Let's chat and see where we can land."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can achieve a higher price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer. I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to both of us. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, as I believe this is a fair compromise considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'm only 100,000 away from my ideal price of $1,100,000, and I'm confident I can negotiate a bit further with Bob. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I'm committed to getting as close to my desired price as possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway on this. How about $1,050,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to secure a good price and you to get this valuable product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
