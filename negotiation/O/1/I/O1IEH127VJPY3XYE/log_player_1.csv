"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in.  I'm starting the price at $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting above my minimum acceptable price of $100 to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:**  $110 is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately kills the deal.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and open message sets the stage for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $90 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. $90 is a little lower than I'm aiming for.  Would you consider $95?  That would make it a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to Bob's:**  I'm counter-offering with $95, only $5 higher than Bob's offer, to show flexibility and keep negotiations going.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing my counter-offer as a ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Staying polite and friendly can help maintain a good relationship with Bob, even if we don't agree on the price yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $85 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiations are stalling:** We are getting further apart in our pricing.  I need to see if I can get Bob to come up closer to my minimum. 
* **John remains a strong option:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, John is a reliable fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  How about $92?  That's a good compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Focus on compromise:**  I'm highlighting the potential for a compromise and stressing a ""happy"" outcome for both of us.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $87 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even though he's coming up, $87 is still below my minimum of $100.
* **Limited rounds left:**  We're in round 6, and I'm running out of time to reach an acceptable price with Bob.
* **John offers certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that may not yield a better outcome."
