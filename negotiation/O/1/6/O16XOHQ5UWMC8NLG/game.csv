"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still higher than $850,000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it more reasonable. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
