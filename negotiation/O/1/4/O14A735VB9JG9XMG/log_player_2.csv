"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. It makes the most sense to go with your alternative option and buy from John for $80."
