{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what it can do for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we want to maximize our profit. Starting high gives us room to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so we don't want to go below that price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""demand,"" we create a sense of desirability and urgency.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how price-sensitive Bob is or his negotiation style. 
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, we might adjust our strategy to be less aggressive.
 
This offer is just the opening move. We'll need to be prepared to adjust our approach based on Bob's response."
