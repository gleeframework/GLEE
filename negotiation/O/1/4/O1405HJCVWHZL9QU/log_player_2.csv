"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.  Alice is offering it for the exact same price.  There's no benefit to buying from Alice, and you're not going to save any money.  Since John is also willing to sell at your maximum price, you might as well buy from him."
