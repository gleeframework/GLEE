"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $150. There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable given my maximum budget. This will hopefully prompt Alice to counter with a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $55 is closer to my target, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still below Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $57.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $57.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice is starting to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than buying from John."
