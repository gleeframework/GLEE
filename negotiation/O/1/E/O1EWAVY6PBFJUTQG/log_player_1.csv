Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm open to negotiation to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I use positive language to make the offer more appealing and build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to continue the process to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $95, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price by $5, showing flexibility but still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Willingness to Negotiate:** I emphasize my desire to find a ""middle ground"" to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a polite and respectful tone to encourage continued dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now just $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $90. I'm willing to accept this offer since it's close to what I'd get from John, and it seems likely further negotiation would only lead to more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a higher price.  I'm willing to take the $92 and avoid the risk of delaying the sale further."
