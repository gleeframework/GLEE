"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for your product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his counteroffer by being aggressive and aiming for a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. He is proposing a price that is still within his budget, but is a good starting point for negotiations.  This counteroffer will hopefully prompt Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for a product worth $8,000 to you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,250 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum threshold of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is fair considering the product's value to me. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now sticking to his maximum budget of $8,000. He's framing his counteroffer as a ""fair"" price, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and close the deal. This is likely to be his final offer before considering buying from John."
