"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for your product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for a product worth $8,000 to you. ",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is fair considering the product's value to me. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
