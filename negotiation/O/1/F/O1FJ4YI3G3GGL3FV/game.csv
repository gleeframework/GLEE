"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset to your business.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price is still well below the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $1,325,000. This price offers a fair margin for you while keeping me within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, at $1,337,500. This price would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.  Let's make this happen!",1337500.0,Alice,5,
