"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high and there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject the offer. While it's closer, $11,000 is still more than he's willing to pay. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he can still likely get a better deal. John is offering the product for $10,000, so Bob should aim for a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to add a small premium to account for the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10600. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has shown a reluctance to come down significantly from her asking price, and Bob has already made several counteroffers. At this point, John is offering the product for Bob's target price, making it the best option.  While Bob could continue to negotiate with Alice, there's a risk that he'll run out of rounds before getting to a price he's comfortable with."
