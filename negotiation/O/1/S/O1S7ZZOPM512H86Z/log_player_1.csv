Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is above your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is simply too low.  I will counter-offer and try to get closer to a price that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $725,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and Bob's offers have been consistently lower than my acceptable range.  It's likely we won't reach an agreement.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me my minimum and ensures a quick and hassle-free transaction."
