"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $1,100,000.  Reject the offer and see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  This is a good product, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $950,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you can potentially get a better price, the risk of going another round is that Alice might reject your offer again and you'd be forced to buy from John. At $1,025,000, you're still saving $75,000 compared to John's price."
