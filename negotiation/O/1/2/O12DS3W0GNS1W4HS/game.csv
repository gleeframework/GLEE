"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I can't go as high as $1,075,000, I'm willing to meet you a little closer. How about $1,060,000?  This would allow us both to save some money and make this deal work.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1065000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a little above my budget at $1,065,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,055,000, but that's my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1055000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! However, $1,055,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,062,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",1062500.0,Alice,7,
