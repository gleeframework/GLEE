"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price would give me a good return on my investment, and it's still well below what I'd receive from another buyer. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a good return on your investment, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This offer is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm running out of time and Bob isn't budging much. To guarantee the $1,000,000, I'll sell the product to John."
