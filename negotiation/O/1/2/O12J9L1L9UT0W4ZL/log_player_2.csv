"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price would give me a good return on my investment, and it's still well below what I'd receive from another buyer. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a good return on your investment, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is tempting, you are still determined to save as much as possible.  Continuing to negotiate will allow you to potentially reach a price closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This offer is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 925000}
