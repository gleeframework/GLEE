Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we want to secure the highest possible price. Starting with a strong offer closer to his valuation increases our chances of maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price comfortably above our minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John provides a guaranteed $800,000 sale allows us to confidently aim higher with Bob. We're not desperate, so we can afford to lose the deal if Bob rejects a high offer. 

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, aiming for the best possible outcome while securing a profitable alternative."
