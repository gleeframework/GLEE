Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is well above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for Bob by mentioning a lower price than what I could get elsewhere.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This offer gives me space to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Plan B:** I'll keep John as a backup, knowing I can secure my minimum price if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, I can still try to negotiate a better price. It's possible we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John is a secure backup:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum price.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, giving you a good deal and me a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's still higher than his initial value, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to accept a drastically low price.
* **Highlighting the value gap:** I'm reminding Bob of the significant difference between his offer and the product's true value.
* **Reaching a middle ground:** $1,100,000 represents a compromise, offering Bob a better price than my initial offer but still ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for more discussion, showing I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation has stalled:**  Bob's offer shows he's unwilling to budge much further.  It's unlikely we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement with continued negotiation at this point.
* **John offers a secure alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

I'm going to sell the product to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but unfortunately, $750,000 is simply not a price I can accept.  It's much too low for the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $900,000.  This is my absolute final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This is my last offer, emphasizing the limited room for negotiation left.
* **Significant concession:**  While still above Bob's offer, this demonstrates willingness to compromise.
* **Threatening to walk away:**  This subtly pushes Bob to take the offer, highlighting the alternative of selling to John.
* **Fair but firm:**  $900,000 represents a significant profit for me while still potentially offering Bob a good deal.

I hope Bob accepts this final offer. However, if he rejects, I'll move on to John to secure the minimum price."
