"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, giving you a good deal and me a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but unfortunately, $750,000 is simply not a price I can accept.  It's much too low for the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $900,000.  This is my absolute final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's final offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, guaranteeing you stay within your budget. There's no point in risking a higher counteroffer that Alice might reject."
