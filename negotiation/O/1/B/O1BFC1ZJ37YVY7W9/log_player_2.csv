"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. We're looking to maximize our earnings, so we're offering it to you for $140. Please let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's a great item, $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value. This gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The tone is important in negotiations. I want to appear interested but firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your feedback and are willing to negotiate. To better align with your budget, we propose offering the product for $125. This still allows us to achieve our earnings goal while providing you with a value that meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. Her offer is closer to her value than mine, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows I'm willing to compromise and move towards her price point.
* **Still Below My Limit:**  $117 keeps me well below my $150 maximum and leaves a bit of room for further negotiation if needed."
