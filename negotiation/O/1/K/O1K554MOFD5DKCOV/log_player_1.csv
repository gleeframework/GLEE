Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [Product Name] that I think you'd be interested in.  It's in excellent condition and comes with [mention some features or benefits].  I'm asking $18,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. It's important to start high as you can always come down in price.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights some key features of the product.  It also shows you're open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to start the negotiation high while remaining open to offers.  You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's potential interest.  

By offering a high starting price, you can gain some leverage and potentially get closer to your desired price.  Keep in mind, it's crucial to monitor Bob's reactions and adjust your approach throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's condition and features. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum value, it's important to remember your goal is to maximize your earnings. Since you don't know Bob's true value for the product, there's a chance you could potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His willingness to counteroffer shows he's still interested.
* **Create leverage:**  Rejecting the offer suggests you're not desperate to sell, potentially encouraging Bob to increase his bid.

**Next Steps:**

You should now formulate a counteroffer to Bob. Consider factors like:

* **How much higher than $12,000 are you comfortable going?**
* **Do you want to meet Bob halfway?**
* **What is your assessment of Bob's financial capacity?**

Remember, the goal is to find a price that balances your desire for profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little below what I'm looking for.  Considering the product's quality and features, I'd be willing to accept $15,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my asking price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** The counteroffer of $15,000 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than your initial asking price. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's financial constraints. 
* **Strategy:**  This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profits and maintaining a good relationship with Bob. By offering a price closer to your minimum value, you signal a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Bob's reaction:** Observe Bob's response carefully. If he seems hesitant or makes another low counteroffer, you might need to reconsider your strategy. 
* **Your alternative:** Remember that you have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. This gives you a safety net and allows you to be more assertive during the negotiation."
