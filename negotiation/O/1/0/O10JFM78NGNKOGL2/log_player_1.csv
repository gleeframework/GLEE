"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not outrageous. It will give Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay more.  I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still leaving some room for profit. I hope this will convince Bob to meet me halfway."
