"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $11,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
