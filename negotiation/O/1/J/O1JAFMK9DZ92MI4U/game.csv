"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for moving closer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $14,000? It's a bit more than my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort, but that price jump is a bit concerning. I'm serious about buying, but I need to see some real movement towards a price we both find reasonable.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $13,500? It's a bit more than my minimum, and I'm willing to make a serious compromise.",13500.0,Alice,7,
