"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my maximum price and John's offer. It's in my best interest to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than my actual maximum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating ""around $8,000"" I signal flexibility and openness to counteroffers.
* **Expressing Interest:**  It's important to express continued interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down significantly, it's still above both my target price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for moving closer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer to $9,500, demonstrating movement towards Alice's price but still staying below my maximum.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise"" I aim to find a mutually agreeable point.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  Alice is likely aware I have an alternative option with John, so it's essential to keep the negotiation moving without conceding too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $14,000? It's a bit more than my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, moving further away from a reasonable compromise. This suggests she might be trying to test my resolve or is not genuinely interested in meeting near the middle ground.  It's crucial to remain firm and signal that I have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort, but that price jump is a bit concerning. I'm serious about buying, but I need to see some real movement towards a price we both find reasonable.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Respectful:** I'm expressing my concern about the price increase while reaffirming my interest in the product.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting my maximum price of $10,000. This is a non-negotiable point, and Alice needs to understand this.
* **Implied Alternative:**  By not budging, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have the option of going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $13,500? It's a bit more than my minimum, and I'm willing to make a serious compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not negotiating in good faith. She keeps increasing her offer or making minimal concessions.  It's clear she's unlikely to accept my maximum price of $10,000.  It's time to walk away and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
