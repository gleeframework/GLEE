"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price point of $1,000,000. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue exploring a lower price and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably commit to. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000, which is a significant investment for me, but still leaves some room for us to both come out ahead."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000 rather than risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
