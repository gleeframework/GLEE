"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which is a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably commit to. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000, which is a significant investment for me, but still leaves some room for us to both come out ahead.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
