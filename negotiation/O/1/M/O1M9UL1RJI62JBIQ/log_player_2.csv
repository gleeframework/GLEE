# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price point. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and want to see if I can get a lower price. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence on the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to move the deal forward. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $715,000, which is very close to my target price of $700,000. I've already rejected her offer twice and the risk of her getting upset and walking away is high.  I'm confident I can still save a significant amount compared to buying from John, so I'll accept the offer."
