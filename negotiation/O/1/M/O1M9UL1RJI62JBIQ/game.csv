"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $725,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time. I'm sticking with my offer of $700,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and gives us both a good deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence on the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to move the deal forward. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",715000.0,Alice,5,
