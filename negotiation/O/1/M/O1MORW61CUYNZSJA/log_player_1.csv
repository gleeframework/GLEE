"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to $13,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from the initial price, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm firm on $12,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value. If you're serious about acquiring it, let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product, and I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $12,000, I'm worried that Bob and I are at an impasse.  It's looking like I'm unlikely to get a higher price from him, so I'll take John's offer and sell to him."
