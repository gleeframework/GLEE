"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth every penny to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway again, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,037,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
