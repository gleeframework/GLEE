Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150,  which is a decent markup from my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $140.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and still securing a good profit for me."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
