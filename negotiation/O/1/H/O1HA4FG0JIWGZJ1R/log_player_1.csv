Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and inviting to build rapport.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll wait for his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his proposed price. 
* If the negotiation stalls or doesn't seem promising, I'll go with the guaranteed $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $80. Accepting this would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** Bob has shown interest in the product, and his counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate.  There's room to find a compromise.
* **John is a fallback:**  I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $120, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Next steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $90 is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $70.  This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to reiterate the benefit of the deal for Bob. 
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and friendly to keep the negotiation going. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, we have a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $120. I'll evaluate Bob's counteroffer and my desire to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too expensive for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I was offered by John, the other seller. I'd be happy to buy it from you at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** While $80 is still below my ideal price, it's at my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer. 
* **Time is money:**  Selling to Bob at $80 is a quicker and more certain outcome than trying to negotiate further or waiting to see if John will make a higher offer.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
