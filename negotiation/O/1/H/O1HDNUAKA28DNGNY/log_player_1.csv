Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,450,000, which reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but slightly below my guaranteed price.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""true worth and potential,"" aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than $800,000 but still below my guaranteed offer.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
