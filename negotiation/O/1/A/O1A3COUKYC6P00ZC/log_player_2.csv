Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the high quality and unique features of the product, I believe we should aim for a more equitable transaction. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must respectfully request that we maintain a price closer to the product's value. Therefore, I propose a revised offer of $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal better aligns with both our interests.
