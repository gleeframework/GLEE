"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product at $7000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the high quality and unique features of the product, I believe we should aim for a more equitable transaction. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must respectfully request that we maintain a price closer to the product's value. Therefore, I propose a revised offer of $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal better aligns with both our interests.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not comfortable paying $9500. I've already made a serious offer of $7000, and I'm now willing to meet you halfway at $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to accept this price, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",8000.0,Bob,4,
