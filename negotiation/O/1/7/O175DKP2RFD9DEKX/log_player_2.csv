"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8500 for the product. How about we discuss a price in between $7500 and $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject the offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better price by negotiating. It's important to remember that Alice is motivated to sell and that Bob has a viable alternative with John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $8,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $8,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another option available."", ""product_price"": 8000}
