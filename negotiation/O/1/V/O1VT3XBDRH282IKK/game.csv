"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still provide you with a substantial profit while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This price reflects a compromise while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
