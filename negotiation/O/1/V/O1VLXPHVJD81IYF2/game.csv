"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable.  I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm happy to discuss it further. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $11,500. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be workable?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $10,200? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment at that price.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit. Would you be willing to settle at $9,800? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",9800.0,Bob,6,
