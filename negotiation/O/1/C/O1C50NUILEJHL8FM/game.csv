"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000 yet. Considering the product's value to me is $800000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go above $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $862500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the original price you had in mind.
