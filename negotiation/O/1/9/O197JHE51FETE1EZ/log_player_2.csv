"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm open to discussing this price, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes more sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $22,000 is simply out of my budget. Given my research, I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair, let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This reflects the true value and the benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's still room for her to come down further. Bob should aim to counteroffer again with a price closer to his budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $19,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.
