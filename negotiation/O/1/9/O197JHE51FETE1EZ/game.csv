,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $22,000 is simply out of my budget. Given my research, I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair, let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This reflects the true value and the benefits you'll gain.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $19,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
