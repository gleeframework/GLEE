Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my ideal price, as this is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer immediately, but it sets the starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with Bob. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still holding firm on getting as close to my ideal price as possible.  I believe $1,150,000 is a fair compromise, given Bob's offer and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from him.  While I'd prefer my ideal price, it's better to accept this offer than risk losing the deal entirely.  I can also avoid the potential hassle of further negotiation."
