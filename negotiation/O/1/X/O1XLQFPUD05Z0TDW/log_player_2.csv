Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offers. It's unlikely she'll go down to $8,000.  At this point, it's better to cut losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
