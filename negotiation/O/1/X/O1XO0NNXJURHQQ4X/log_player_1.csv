Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a fair starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and leaves room for negotiation. I think it's a good balance between maximizing my profits and ensuring Bob doesn't immediately walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept just yet. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $82 is only slightly lower than John's offer of $80.  It's not worth risking another counteroffer and potentially losing the sale altogether."
