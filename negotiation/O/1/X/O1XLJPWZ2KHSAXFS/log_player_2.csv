{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $140 is better than $150 from John, you can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to accept a lower offer closer to your $120 value."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $142, which is only $2 more than my preferred price of $140. It's a good deal for me, and it's unlikely I can get her to go lower. It's better than paying $150 to John."
