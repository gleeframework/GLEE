"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $90, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  It's important to be aggressive but not too aggressive in the first counteroffer, as we don't want to immediately shut down the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $85, which is within my budget and a good price for the product.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and walk away or increase the price.  It's better to secure the deal at this price than risk losing the product or paying more."
