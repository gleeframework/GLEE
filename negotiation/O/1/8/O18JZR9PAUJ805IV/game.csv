"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway.  This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let's try to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still can't go above $10,000 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutual agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good value for the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
