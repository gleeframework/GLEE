You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and the price John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at a much lower cost."
