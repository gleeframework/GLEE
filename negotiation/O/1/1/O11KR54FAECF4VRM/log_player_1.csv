Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  A price slightly below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to accept."
