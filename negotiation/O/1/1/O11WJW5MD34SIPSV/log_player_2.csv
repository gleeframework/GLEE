"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $95.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm offering Alice $75. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my $80 limit as possible before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $90 is still above my desired price. It's better to keep negotiating.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $80.  This is my final offer, and if she rejects it, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $85 is still slightly above my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll keep rejecting offers and I'll run out of time. It's more efficient to buy from John now and secure the product at my desired price."
