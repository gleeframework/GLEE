"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum value, making it attractive to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.  I've also included a friendly message to establish rapport and encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range. I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've lowered my price by $2,000, which shows I'm willing to compromise. This offer is still well above my minimum value, and it leaves room for further negotiation. By including a positive message, I aim to keep the conversation friendly and encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better offer.  My minimum acceptable price is $15,000 and $9,000 is still significantly lower than that.  I'm going to hold out for a higher price and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this - how about $9,500? That seems like a fair price for both of us, and it would get us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,500 as a counteroffer.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer but still leaves some room for further negotiation.  My goal is to reach a price as close to my desired value of $15,000 as possible. I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to compromise, Bob will also be open to meeting me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your effort in reaching a compromise. I would like to suggest a price of $9,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. With 4 rounds remaining, I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  I believe we are close to a deal, and I want to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a little more to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,375?  It's a small adjustment, but it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 9375}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,375 as a counteroffer. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, it also keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value. With only 3 rounds remaining, I want to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to make a final concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $9,300 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $9,300 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I've been able to push the price up somewhat, it's unlikely that I'll be able to reach my desired value in the remaining rounds.  

Therefore, it's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum acceptable value. It's important to recognize when further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome, and to secure a guaranteed deal when possible."
