**Explanation:**

Alice is being stubborn. She's only dropped $100 from her previous offer. With only a few rounds left, it's not likely she'll budge any further.  While $9,100 is closer to my budget, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with, and I don't want to risk losing more rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
