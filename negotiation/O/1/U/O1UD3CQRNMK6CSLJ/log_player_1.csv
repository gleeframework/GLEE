Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down.
* **Justification:** Offering a vague justification like ""significant value"" might pique Bob's interest and make him more open to considering the offer. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know our minimum. Aiming for $15,000 allows for potential profit while still being within a reasonable range.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.
* Observe Bob's reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly. 
* Remember, you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below that."
