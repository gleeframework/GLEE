"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and exceptional quality, I am confident it will be a valuable addition to your operations. Considering its intrinsic worth and the benefits it offers, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $12,000. This price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and my goal to maximize its profitability. I look forward to discussing how this product can contribute to your success. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $8,000. 
* You have a backup option to buy from John for $15,000, but there's room for negotiation with Alice.
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price, potentially leading her to lower it closer to her own valuation."
