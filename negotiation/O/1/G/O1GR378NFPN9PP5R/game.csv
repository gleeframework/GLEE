"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. While I appreciate your offer,  $7,900 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,050. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a win-win situation.",8050.0,Alice,7,
