"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a good price, and me to get closer to my desired value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me halfway again?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle again - I'll come down to $887,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great product at a price that's still well below its true value. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",880000.0,Bob,6,
