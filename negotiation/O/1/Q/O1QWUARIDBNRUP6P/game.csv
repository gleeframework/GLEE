"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a reasonable profit margin.",700000.0,Alice,3,
