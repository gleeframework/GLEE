It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm starting with a price close to my maximum, but leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also that I'm aware of the product's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

While $9,500 is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming to inch closer to my goal."
