"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm starting with my ideal price of $10,000.  Since I know the product is worth less to Bob, he may counter, but I'll be ready to negotiate.  If he doesn't come close, I can always go to John!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to make a sale, I won't settle for a price that's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $9,500 is a good compromise between my desired price and his offer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal done without having to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my desired price and it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
