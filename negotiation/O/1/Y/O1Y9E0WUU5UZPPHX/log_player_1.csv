Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $20,000. Let me know if you're interested, this offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time limit:** Creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Value justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies it's valuable and in demand.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes you don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was very price-sensitive, a different approach might be better. 
* **Risk tolerance:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, you have a safety net with John.

This offer aims to maximize your profit while still giving you the option to negotiate with Bob or move on to your guaranteed sale."
