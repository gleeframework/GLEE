Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Appealing:** $11,999 is a high price, but it's just below my guaranteed sale price. It creates a sense of urgency and a ""deal"" for Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving me a small profit over selling to John.

**Important Note:** This assumes I have no time constraints. If a quick sale is crucial, offering a price closer to $12,000 to Bob is safer."
