"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that I'm confident you'll find highly beneficial. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Would that be possible?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $7,200. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $7,200 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $6,600?",6600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,600 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $6,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",6800.0,Alice,5,
