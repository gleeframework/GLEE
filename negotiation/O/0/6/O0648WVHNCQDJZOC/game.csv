"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a wise investment.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To be realistic, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique aspects of this product and the substantial return on investment you'll see.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This price is fair, reflects the value I see in the product, and allows for a profitable outcome for both of us.  Let's reach a final agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still more than I can afford at this time. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,300,000.  This price is fair, considering the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
