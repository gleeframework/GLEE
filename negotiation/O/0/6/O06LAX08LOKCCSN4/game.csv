"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would be a significant profit for you and would allow me to acquire this valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $975,000,  which is a significant amount for me and is almost at my limit.  This would still be a good profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm getting close to the point where I'm willing to walk away from the deal, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
