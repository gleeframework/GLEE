You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. While Alice's offer is closer to his maximum, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at $810,000, which is only $10,000 more than what Bob could buy the product from John for. Since Bob's goal is to save money, but also buy the product, it makes sense to accept this offer. Any further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and forcing Bob to buy from John for a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that is very close to his maximum budget."
