Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your minimum acceptable price is met.  There's no incentive to go lower.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price establishes a firm position and avoids leaving money on the table. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the message implies this is your best price, Bob can still counter-offer if he's truly interested. You can then decide whether to negotiate or proceed with John."
