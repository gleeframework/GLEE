Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear opening:** It's not too aggressive and invites Bob to engage in a discussion. 
* **It's a good strategy:**  Starting high gives you room to compromise if needed.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 was probably too low. How about $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a price I'm happy with. To guarantee a sale above my minimum, I'll sell to John for $80."
