``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's still significantly less than what the product is worth to you, giving Bob a good reason to consider it.  I'm confident that this will encourage a response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $800,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still far below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range to see if we can find a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept anything significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."
