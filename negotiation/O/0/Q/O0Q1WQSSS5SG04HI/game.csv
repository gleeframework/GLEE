"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a great opportunity for you.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
