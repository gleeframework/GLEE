"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's a good chance he'll accept or counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still being above my minimum. If Bob is serious about buying the product, he should be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter again, hoping to get him closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's last offer.  It shows flexibility and may encourage him to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to him. There are only a few rounds left, and it's not likely that I'll get a better offer from him.  It's also possible that John could change his mind, so it's best to secure the deal with Bob."
