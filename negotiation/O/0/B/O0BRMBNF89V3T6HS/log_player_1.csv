Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows for potential profit above that. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a price point that:
    * Offers Bob a considerable discount, making it more enticing.
    * Still secures a significant profit for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters, while still aiming for a higher profit margin."
