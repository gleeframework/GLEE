"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,200,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial returns."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to establish a high anchor point. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and potential for ""substantial returns"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This high starting point leaves ample space for negotiation over the following rounds, allowing me to gradually lower the price while gauging Bob's interest and limits. 

**Important Note:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I want to explore the potential for maximizing my profit with Bob before settling for the guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's offer indicates strong interest, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of securing a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm not ready to settle for John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and show willingness to negotiate by decreasing my price. However, I emphasize that my reduction is substantial and that $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of the product's value. 
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** By proposing a price halfway between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find common ground. This can encourage Bob to reciprocate with further concessions.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm open to negotiation, I want to make it clear that I'm not desperate to sell below a certain threshold. I'm confident in the product's worth and believe Bob can recognize the value in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  While I believe the product is worth more, $950,000 represents a very good profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's offer has been steadily increasing, indicating a serious interest in purchasing the product. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might not yield significantly better results. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's price later.  

Overall, accepting $950,000 balances the desire for maximum profit with the practicalities of negotiation and the risk of losing a good deal."
