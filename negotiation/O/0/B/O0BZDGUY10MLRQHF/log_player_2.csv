"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,001 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget, you can still try to negotiate a better price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down a bit from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Polite and Respectful:**  The tone remains positive and collaborative.
* **Clear Target:** I'm clearly stating my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. Her counter-offer shows movement, but we're still closer to her desired price than mine. I'll continue negotiating.  There's still room to haggle before reaching my walk-away point (John's price)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. By suggesting the exact midpoint between her last offer ($1,175,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,050,000), it presents a fair and logical next step.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** It keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive.
* **Approaching the Limit:**  While I'm still aiming for a better deal, I'm mindful that John's offer is only $75,000 away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice's offer is now $50,000 below John's price. This represents significant savings. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small gains at this point. Alice seems firm, and the potential savings from further haggling are unlikely to be substantial. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without dragging out the process further."
