"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. How about we try $105? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
