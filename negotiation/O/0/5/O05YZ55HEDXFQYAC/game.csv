"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good value for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
