Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $1,275,000 isn't quite working for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure it's a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, there are only two rounds left.  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk having to sell to John for a lower price.  $1,290,000 is still above my minimum, and it's a good deal for me considering the remaining rounds."
