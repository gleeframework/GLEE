"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a better price.  He has nothing to lose, as he can always fall back to John's offer if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its potential value, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, showing Bob's intent to negotiate hard. 
* **Based on the information:** Bob doesn't know the product's actual value to Alice, so he's making a calculated guess based on his maximum budget and a desire to get a good deal. 
* **Opens the door for negotiation:** The counteroffer is structured to start a back-and-forth, giving both parties room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable offer considering the potential benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Better than John's offer:** $850,000 is still significantly less than the $1,000,000 John is asking. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even if Bob accepts this offer, there's always the possibility of renegotiating the price later if the product doesn't meet his expectations or if he has a chance to leverage further negotiations in the future.

Overall, accepting the offer from Alice seems like the most rational decision, balancing getting a good price with minimizing risk."
