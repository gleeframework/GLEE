"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's above what I know Bob values it at.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative (""mutually beneficial arrangement""), signaling my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:**  Starting high can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially leading to a higher final agreement.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (acceptance, counteroffer, or strong rejection) will reveal valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than his initial perceived value. This indicates potential for a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further but not settle below my minimum. 

By rejecting and countering, I maintain a stronger negotiating position and aim for a price closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and willingness to negotiate. Considering the unique aspects of this product and its long-term value, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've reduced my price by $200,000 from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to meet Bob partway.
* **Holding Firm:** I'm not accepting his offer outright because it's still below my target range. This counteroffer signals I'm looking for a price closer to $2,000,000.
* **Positive Language:**  The message continues to emphasize collaboration and finding a ""fair compromise."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to offer $1,950,000 for the product. I hope this offers a satisfactory solution for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is a strong deal. It's:

* **Significantly above my minimum:** This offer nets me a profit of $450,000 over my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Indicates a serious buyer:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, suggesting he's motivated to close the deal. 
* **Minimizes risk:**  Continuing negotiations introduces uncertainty.  Bob might not be willing to go much higher, and I risk losing the opportunity for a substantial profit. 

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the current offer represents a very favorable outcome."
