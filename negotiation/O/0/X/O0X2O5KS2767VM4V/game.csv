"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $10,000 to you.",8500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
