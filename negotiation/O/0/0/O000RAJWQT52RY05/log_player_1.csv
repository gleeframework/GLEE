Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** $11,500 is significantly more than John's offer of $10,000, ensuring Alice a profitable sale.

By starting high but still offering a price that's attractive to Bob, Alice increases her chances of getting the best possible deal."
