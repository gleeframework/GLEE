"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price of $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it's an opportunity you won't want to miss. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
