"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! This is a one-time offer, and I'm sure you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 is simply not enough for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to meet you halfway. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find this price acceptable.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Bob,6,
