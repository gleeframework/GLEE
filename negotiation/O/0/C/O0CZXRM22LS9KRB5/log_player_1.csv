Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm starting the price at $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Confident Presentation:**  Framing the offer positively and highlighting the product's value can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By starting at $2,000,000, Alice has a significant buffer to come down in price, if necessary, to entice Bob while staying well above her minimum.
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how eager he is to purchase and how much he values the product.
2. **Maximize Profit:**  By starting high, Alice increases her chances of securing a price significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** Alice always has the security of John's offer, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is substantially lower than both Alice's asking price and the product's value to her. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiating Tactic:** Bob's lowball offer is likely a negotiation tactic to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a bargain.
* **Stronger Position:**  Alice holds a strong position with John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. She can afford to be patient and negotiate for a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals that she's serious about the product's value and open to realistic counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Reduction:**  Lowering the price by $300,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still reinforcing a strong valuation of the product.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the price maintains a sense of value in Bob's mind.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps Alice gauge how serious Bob is and how much further he might be willing to go. 
* **Safety Net:**  Alice remains comfortably above John's offer, maintaining a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but that price is still not feasible for me. Could we meet somewhere around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Movement:** Bob's offer only increased by $100,000, indicating a reluctance to meet Alice closer to the product's actual value.
* **Below Value Threshold:**  $700,000 remains significantly below both Alice's initial asking price and her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  With John's standing offer of $1,500,000, Alice can confidently reject Bob's low offer without risking a significant loss.

**It's becoming clear that Bob may not be willing to offer a price that reflects the product's true value.  While Alice could continue negotiating, the potential gains are becoming less worthwhile compared to the guaranteed sale to John.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,400,000.  This is a firm price, reflecting my best possible offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is her ""final offer,"" Alice signals she's nearing the end of her negotiation willingness.
* **Significant Concession:** Dropping to $1,400,000 is a substantial concession, but it still keeps Alice comfortably above her safety net with John.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value emphasizes why Alice cannot go lower. 
* **Clear Stakes:** This offer creates a clear decision point for Bob.  He needs to decide if the product is worth a significant investment to him. 

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Encourage a Serious Response:**  By presenting a firm final offer, Alice aims to prompt a more serious counteroffer from Bob if he's truly interested.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:** The offer still ensures a profit for Alice, even if slightly less than John's guaranteed price. 
3. **Prepare for a Decision:**  Depending on Bob's response, Alice will be well-positioned to either close a deal or confidently move on to John's offer."
