"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and he's willing to pay up to $120. Alice's initial offer of $160 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer of $110, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $120. While it's closer, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob can continue trying to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $115. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise but still maintains a price lower than his maximum. The goal is to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal before running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is getting closer to Bob's maximum of $120, there are still 5 rounds left. Bob can likely negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price of $120. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, indicating he's willing to close the deal if Alice agrees. With only four rounds remaining, it's crucial to make a strong counteroffer. If Alice rejects, Bob can always buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $120. With only three rounds remaining, the chance of negotiating a lower price is decreasing.  Since John offers the product for the same price Bob is willing to pay, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
