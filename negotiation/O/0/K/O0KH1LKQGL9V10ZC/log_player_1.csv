Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to make a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.
