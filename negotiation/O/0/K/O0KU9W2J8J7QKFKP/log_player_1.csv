``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed floor price of $1,200,000. 

My reasoning is that:

* **Potential for higher profit:** I want to maximize my earnings, and a higher price means more money for me.
* **Testing the market:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price if he's truly interested.
* **John as backup:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
