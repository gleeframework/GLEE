Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he has room to negotiate upwards.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $120, so you have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** A $100 price is a reasonable starting point, and allows for a bit of wiggle room for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
