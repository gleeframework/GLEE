Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on a better deal just yet.

While we could try to push Alice further in the last round, the difference is now relatively small and there's a risk she won't budge. Accepting at $10,600 secures a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price."
