"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm starting the offer at $20000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still above my budget.  I'm comfortable at $9000. It's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but $9000 simply doesn't reflect the worth of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price is fair and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still firm on $9000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay for the product.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach an agreement here.",9000.0,Bob,6,
