"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $11,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
