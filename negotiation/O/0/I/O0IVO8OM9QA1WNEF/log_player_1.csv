"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $11,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $12,500 is a good price, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than John's offer. I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potential rejection."
