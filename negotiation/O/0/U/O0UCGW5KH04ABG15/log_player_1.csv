"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This will give me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm not ready to sell yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm.  I believe $1,100,000 is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I'm confident we can close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to sell yet. I'm still confident I can get closer to $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to a deal, and he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell at this price. I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm now offering a price that's just slightly higher than Bob's latest offer. It's a good compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to finally accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting closer to his minimum than mine.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not confident I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so I'll take that option."
