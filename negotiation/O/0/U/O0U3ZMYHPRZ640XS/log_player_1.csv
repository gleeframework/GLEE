Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than our desired price. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, we can likely secure a better deal.
