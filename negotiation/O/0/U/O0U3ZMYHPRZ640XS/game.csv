"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $820,000 is  lower than I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $900,000, which would be $860,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $860,000 is closer, I can't accept anything below $880,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $860,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $860,000 and $880,000, which would be $870,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",870000.0,Bob,6,
