**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $975,000 offer. We've reached a point of diminishing returns. Accepting his offer means a loss of $225,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. While there's a slim chance of getting more from Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this stage."
