"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point.  I'm motivated to close this deal with you, but I need to see a price closer to my original ask.  How about $1,000,000? This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make one final offer: $975,000. This is my absolute maximum. If you can meet me at this price, I'll close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
