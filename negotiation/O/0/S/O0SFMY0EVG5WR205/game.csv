"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
