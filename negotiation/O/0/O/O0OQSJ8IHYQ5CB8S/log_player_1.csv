"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I know it's worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while leaving the impression that I'm being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Can you consider $132? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm getting closer to my desired price of $140. While I could keep negotiating, it's risky to risk losing the deal altogether, especially since John is willing to buy for $120.  It's better to secure the sale now."
