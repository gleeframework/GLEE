Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $14,000. I think it would be very valuable to you, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering the product at $14,000 is still significantly less than your minimum ($15,000) but is close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000).  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay $15,000. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
