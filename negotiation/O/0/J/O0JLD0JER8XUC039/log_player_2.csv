"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $11,500 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should attempt to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget ($11,000 is less than $12,000).**
* **This offer is closer to Alice's value of the product ($10,000) than John's offer ($12,000).**

Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John, while still getting a decent price."
