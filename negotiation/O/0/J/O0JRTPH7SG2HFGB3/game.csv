"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is below the minimum I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair profit margin for you.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
