"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop the price to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $125? That's a fair compromise.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $125 is still too far off for me. Let's meet in the middle at $135. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to move on.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  How about $130? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",130.0,Bob,6,
