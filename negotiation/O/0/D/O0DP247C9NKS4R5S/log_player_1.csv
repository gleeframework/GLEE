Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this value."", 
""product_price"": 11000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a significant profit above his perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
