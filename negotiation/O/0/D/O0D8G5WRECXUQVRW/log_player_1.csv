{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation without immediately risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only afford to pay $14,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15500}
