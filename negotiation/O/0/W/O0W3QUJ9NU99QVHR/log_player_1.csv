{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is calculated based on the following:

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $15,000, as that's my minimum value.
* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so I need to offer a price that's attractive to him, but still profitable for me.
* **John's offer:** I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay $15,000, giving me some leverage in negotiations.

By offering $13,500, I'm giving Bob a good deal while still earning more than my minimum and potentially more than I'd get from John. This strategy aims to maximize my profits while ensuring a potential sale."
