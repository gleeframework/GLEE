"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my $12,000 limit. It's too early to buy from John at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality,  $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500. This offer represents a fair price that aligns more with my valuation."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our product's value and your interest, I propose a price of $12,500. This still reflects the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to my budget, I still have room to negotiate. I'm willing to see if she'll come down a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I propose a price of $11,750 for the product. This is higher than your last offer but still below my initial asking price. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but I think there's still room to negotiate. Her counteroffer is only a $500 difference. I'm willing to push a bit further before accepting or going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to bump up my offer slightly to $11,500.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and our respective positions. What do you say?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we've been able to narrow down the price. Considering the ongoing discussion, I propose a final price of $11,625 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise given the value you place on it and the discussions we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems firm on her price, and it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting her offer at $11,625 gets me the product for less than John's $12,000 price."
