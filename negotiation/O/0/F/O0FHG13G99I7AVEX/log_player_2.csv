{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** $140
* **John's price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for $10 less than from John, even though you pay more than the product is worth to Alice. This is the most advantageous option for you."
