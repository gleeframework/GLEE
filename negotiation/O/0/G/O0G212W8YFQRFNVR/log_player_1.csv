Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $110. That's still a great price for such a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal by emphasizing the value of the product."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and ensure I get the highest possible price.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can get a higher counteroffer from him or even sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. While $109 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $111. This is a final offer from me, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

I'm emphasizing this is a final offer to create urgency and pressure Bob into accepting. The price is still above my minimum, but it shows my willingness to compromise. This tactic can help influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $111. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $108. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $120. 

While I'd like to make more money, the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price I'm comfortable with, and we're down to the final two rounds. With only two rounds left, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high. Selling to John guarantees me a profit and avoids the potential for a failed negotiation."
