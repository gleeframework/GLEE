"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. I'm offering $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value to you. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still holding out for $1,090,000.  This would allow me to make a profit while still keeping the price fair for you.  Let's close this deal with a little more give and take, what do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
