Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than my minimum of $800,000.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for that amount if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but also aiming to secure a higher price than his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not the highest possible price, it's significantly more than my minimum and it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a much better outcome.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for John's lower offer."
