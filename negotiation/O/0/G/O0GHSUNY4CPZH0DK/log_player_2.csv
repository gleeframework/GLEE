You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."

Bob is willing to pay the maximum he's set for the product, but he's trying to push Alice to accept his offer without needing to go to John."
