"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $18000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground at $12000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $12000, which would be $15000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down in price, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I can offer it to you for $16000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're still interested, let's talk.",16000.0,Alice,7,
