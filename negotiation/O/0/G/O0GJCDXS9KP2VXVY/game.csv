"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as you know the product's true value.  While I'm confident in its worth to you, I understand if this price isn't suitable. I'm happy to discuss further, but I do have another interested buyer ready to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
