"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to offer $1150000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1150000, which is $1225000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to offer $1200000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
