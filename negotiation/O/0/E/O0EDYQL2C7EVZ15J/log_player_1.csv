"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold opening offer, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay. If he rejects it, I'll have a better idea of his valuation and can adjust my offers accordingly. Remember, I also have the option to sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about selling but also don't want to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $9,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I still believe I can get a better price than $8,500. This offer is a good compromise that shows I'm flexible but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great opportunity! Bob has finally met my price. It would be unwise to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $9,000."
