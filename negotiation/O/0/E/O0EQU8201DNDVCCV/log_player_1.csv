Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter.  This sets the stage for a negotiation, and I want to see how much he's willing to budge.  I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I need to try and push him higher.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm going to attempt to get closer to that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price point. This should signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting this price, and hopefully, he'll meet me in the middle. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,500,000,  selling to Bob for $1,300,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John."
