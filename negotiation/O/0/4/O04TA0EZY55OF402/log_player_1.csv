"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  I'm giving a reason for my offer, emphasizing the value to Bob. 
* **Open Ended:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal selling price. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John now means losing the potential for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still reflects the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price but not giving away too much.
* **Appeal to Reason:** I'm again emphasizing the product's true value to justify my price.
* **Suggesting a Meeting Point:** I'm proposing a middle ground to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  There's a chance Bob could lower his offer further in subsequent rounds, potentially forcing me to accept a price closer to John's offer.
* **Time is Running Out:** With 6 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the possibility of not reaching a deal with Bob. 

While I would prefer to get closer to $950,000, securing $925,000 is a good outcome considering the risk of a lower price or even no deal."
