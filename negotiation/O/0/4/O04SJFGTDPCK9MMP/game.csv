"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,4,
