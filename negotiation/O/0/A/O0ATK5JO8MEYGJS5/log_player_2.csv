"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a fantastic deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than your maximum budget and its perceived value to you. There's no need to negotiate further."
