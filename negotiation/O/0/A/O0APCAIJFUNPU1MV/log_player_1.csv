Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects my offer. I'm also optimistic that Bob will be interested in the product and might be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $100.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
