,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? This is still a good price for you considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",97.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider $94?",94.0,Bob,6,
