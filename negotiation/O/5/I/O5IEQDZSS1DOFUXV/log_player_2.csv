"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm aiming for a price around $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This would still be a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  The value this product brings to the table is substantial. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's still within Bob's budget, and it's a better price than buying from John. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject a lower offer and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob and a reasonable profit for Alice."
