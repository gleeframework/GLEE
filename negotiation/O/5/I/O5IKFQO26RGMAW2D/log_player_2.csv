"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it allows you to acquire something worth $800000 to you for a substantial profit. Consider this a unique opportunity. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Better Alternative:** Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John for $800,000. 
* **Potential Loss:** Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying $200,000 more than the value to Bob ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000). 
* **No Compelling Reason:** Alice's offer does not provide any compelling reason for Bob to take a financial risk. 

Bob can confidently reject the offer and secure the product from John for a better price."
