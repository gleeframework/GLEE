"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've been developing for a long time and I'm confident it will be a real asset for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1300000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable product at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a good product, it's not worth paying more than your limit. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
