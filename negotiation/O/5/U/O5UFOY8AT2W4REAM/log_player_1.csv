Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 is slightly below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept, thinking he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to absolutely guarantee the $15,000, selling directly to John is the safer option."
