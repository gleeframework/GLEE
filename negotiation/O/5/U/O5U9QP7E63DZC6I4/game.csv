"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my research and the product's market value, I'm offering $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a significant return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. Let me know if this revised price aligns with your budget.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,900,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This price reflects the product's worth while remaining within my financial constraints. I'm confident this offer is fair and mutually beneficial.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, but I assure you this product is worth a substantial investment.  Let's meet in the middle - $1,650,000. This price reflects the significant value it will bring to your business.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. I believe this offer provides a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but I need to see a more significant jump to make this worthwhile for both of us.  My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a firm price considering its value and the other offers I'm entertaining.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still outside my financial constraints.  I'm pushing my budget to the limit, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
