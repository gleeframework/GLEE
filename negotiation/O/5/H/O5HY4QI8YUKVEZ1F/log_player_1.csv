Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than my minimum price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""quality,"" I'm subtly trying to shift Bob's focus from the price to the potential value the product offers. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Set a high initial price point to influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:** Observe Bob's reaction to understand his willingness to pay.
3. **Maintain Optionality:**  I retain the ability to negotiate down or walk away to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product, which is its value to me. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 matches John's standing offer. While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price ($120) without the risk of further negotiation."
