"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not ideal.**  You can get the product for $11,500 from Alice, which is cheaper than John's $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice values the product at $10,000, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both parties. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  By rejecting, you can attempt to lower the price further.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to formulate a counteroffer that is lower than $11,500 but still within your budget and hopefully attractive enough for Alice to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation by moving the price closer to Alice's value, but still leaves room for compromise. 
* **Testing the waters:**  It's a good starting point to see how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Still within your budget:**  You're offering $1,000 less than Alice's first offer, which is within your maximum price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your ideal price.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is only $250 more than your previous counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings.** While you could try to haggle further, the potential savings are small and the risk of losing the deal entirely increases.
* **Time is a factor.** Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and it's possible that Alice will become less willing to negotiate as time goes on.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it balances a good price with the risk of further negotiation."
