Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm starting with a price of $11,500.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not willing to sell for that yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,250. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping we can reach a deal on this round."
