Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.
