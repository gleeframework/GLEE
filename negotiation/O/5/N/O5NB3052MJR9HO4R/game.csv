"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This price is fair given the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
