Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

This offer starts the negotiation at a strong point, leaving room for potential concessions while still securing a profit significantly higher than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below the potential of the product. There's room for Bob to come up, and I can still make more money by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejections is increasing. Selling to John guarantees a solid profit and avoids further negotiation risk."
