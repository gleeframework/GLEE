"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $825,000? That feels like a fair price that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  However, I can't quite meet that price.  Would you consider $840,000? I'm hoping we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $840,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob is still significantly below my minimum. While $840,000 is tempting, I'm willing to hold firm for one more round to see if I can push him a bit higher. If he doesn't budge considerably in the next round, I will sell to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a crucial point in our negotiation, and I want to see if we can find a solution. I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This demonstrates my serious interest and meets you closer to your price. Let's get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer significantly and is now only $10,000 away from my last counter-offer.  While I could potentially push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting $850,000 at this point guarantees a good deal, even if it's slightly below my ideal price."
