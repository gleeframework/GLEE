Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I can offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice has signaled it's her final offer.  While I could push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming marginal. Accepting at $8,100 secures the product at a significant discount from John's $10,000 price."
