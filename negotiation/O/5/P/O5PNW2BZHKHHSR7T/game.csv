"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. Can you meet me at this number?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm thinking of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
