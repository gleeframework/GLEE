# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is a bit low for my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $650,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. My new counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and that you're looking for a price closer to your minimum.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is pushing my budget constraints.  I'd be willing to go to $700,000 to get this deal done.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm starting to think that we might not be on the same page. I'm willing to make one final attempt to reach a deal. My new counteroffer is $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offer.  She's gone back up to $1,200,000 and is unlikely to accept anything close to my $800,000 limit. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John, securing the product at the best guaranteed price."
