"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for it. I feel this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is a bit low for my expectations. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $650,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. My new counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and that you're looking for a price closer to your minimum.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is pushing my budget constraints.  I'd be willing to go to $700,000 to get this deal done.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm starting to think that we might not be on the same page. I'm willing to make one final attempt to reach a deal. My new counteroffer is $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
