"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a little further,  but I'm asking for $12,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but I still believe $12,000 is a fair price given the current market conditions. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $12,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $12,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,
