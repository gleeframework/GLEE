"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I want to give Bob some room to counter, but I'm not giving away too much. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation. 
* **Early Exit Option:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm keeping this option in mind if the negotiations don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 10 rounds, and it's still early in the negotiation. I believe there's room to push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall apart. 

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a little further,  but I'm asking for $12,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** $12,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go much lower at this stage.
* **Continued Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to continue the conversation and hopefully reach an agreement. 

**Next Step:**

I'll wait to see how Bob reacts to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer, sell to John, or end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe $12,000 is a fair price given the current market conditions. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $12,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Inflexibility:** Bob is sticking to his $12,000 offer, indicating he's unwilling to budge further.
* **Maintaining my Minimum:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Limited:**  We're only in round 4, and I have 6 more rounds to negotiate.

**Next Step:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground. If he remains inflexible, I'll consider selling to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $12,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to increase pressure and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Small Compromise:**  I'm still compromising, but only slightly, aiming to be as close as possible to my minimum without accepting an unacceptable price.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and reminding him that $12,250 is a good deal for him given the product's value. 

**Next Step:**

This is a crucial round. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, especially as the negotiation rounds are getting fewer."
