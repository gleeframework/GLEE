"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get out of this product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,250, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's reach a deal, what do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
