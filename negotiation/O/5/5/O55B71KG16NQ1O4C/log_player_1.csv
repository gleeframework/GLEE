"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially secure a better price, or I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,500. Perhaps we can agree on $9,400? This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting repetitive, and Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum desired price and avoids further risk of losing a better deal.  While I might get a slightly higher price with more rounds of negotiation, the risk of Bob ultimately rejecting my offer or not meeting my minimum price isn't worth it."
