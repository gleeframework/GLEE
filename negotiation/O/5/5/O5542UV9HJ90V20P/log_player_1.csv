Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly below its value to him and leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise, offering you a great deal while reflecting the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price that offers a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but I believe there's still room for Bob to move. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than what I believe the product is worth."

Round 5
