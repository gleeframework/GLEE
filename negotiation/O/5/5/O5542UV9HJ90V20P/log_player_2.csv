"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise, offering you a great deal while reflecting the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's come down, it's still above your maximum budget.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still a gap between your counteroffer ($1,050,000) and Alice's current offer ($1,120,000).  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price that offers a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while recognizing the product's significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:** Alice's offer is only $10,000 above your last counteroffer, and it's within your budget of $1,200,000.
* **Time is a factor:** You've already had several rounds of negotiations, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further. Accepting her offer will save you further negotiation time and effort.
* **Better than John's price:** While John's price is only slightly higher, accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $10,000."
