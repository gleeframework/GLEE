{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I believe it could be of great value to you.  My initial price is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'll reject the offer and see if Bob is willing to come up in price. I have 8 more rounds to work with before I need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000, considering your enthusiasm. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum threshold for selling the product. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering I have limited rounds and the risk of having to settle for John's offer. Accepting this deal ensures a successful transaction and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
