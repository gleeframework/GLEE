Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation creates a strong incentive for him to buy. A price of $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a gain ($1,500,000 - $1,350,000 = $150,000).

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his valuation of the product."
