Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000. This price is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm not ready to accept his offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is simply too far below the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is still a substantial profit for you, and it allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy to accept his offer to ensure a quick sale."
