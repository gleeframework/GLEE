"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at over $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000. This price is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950000 is simply too far below the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $1100000. This is still a substantial profit for you, and it allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
