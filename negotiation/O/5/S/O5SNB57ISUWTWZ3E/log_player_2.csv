Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant discount, aiming to get Alice to come down to a price that works for me.  It's a bold move, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has come down to a price that's within my budget and is significantly less than what I'd pay John.  It's time to close the deal."
