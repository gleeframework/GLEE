"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your time, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to earn a fair price. ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $108, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  To compromise, I'm willing to go down to $112. This price is fair for both of us, and hopefully, we can close the deal on this offer.  Let me know what you think!",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $112 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $109, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm  firmly committed to getting at least $110 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  If you can't meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer. Let me know if you're able to accept this final offer.",110.0,Alice,7,
