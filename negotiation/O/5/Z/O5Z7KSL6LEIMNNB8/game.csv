"Hello Alice, thanks for offering!  While I am interested in the product, $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference again and settle at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,
