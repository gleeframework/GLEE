Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $850,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll throw in a premium service package worth $20,000, which will make the total value of the deal $870,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

Reasoning:

While Alice is trying to sweeten the deal with a service package, the price is not moving significantly down. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. Buying from John for $1,200,000, while more expensive, represents a clean and quick end to the negotiation and ensures I get the product."
