Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's a good compromise, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum. It also opens the conversation with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $100. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has come up slightly, and I'm only $3 away from my initial offer of $95.  While I'd prefer to get closer to that target, accepting $92 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John."
