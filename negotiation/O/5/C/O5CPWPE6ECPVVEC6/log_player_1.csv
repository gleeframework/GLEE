Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I've left some wiggle room to potentially reach a compromise with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. 
* I'll keep in mind that I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.** While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000.
* **I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John.**  This gives me leverage to push for a better price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to reach a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob.** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $9,500 and my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Stay open to negotiation.**  I'll be flexible, but I won't settle for a price that's too low.
* **Keep John in mind.**  If negotiations with Bob stall, I have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $11,000?  That would give us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my desired price:** I've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his $9,500. 
* **Emphasis on finding common ground:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the potential for both of us to benefit from a deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation again.  If his counteroffer is significantly lower than $11,000, I might consider selling to John. 
* I'll continue to be flexible while keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  $9,800 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000, and I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.
* **John is a reliable buyer.** I know John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity.
* **Negotiation has stalled.** Bob's persistent low offers indicate that we might not reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John.**  I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John to secure a profitable sale. 
* **End negotiation with Bob.**  It's clear that we're too far apart on price, and I need to move on."
