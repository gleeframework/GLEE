I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept a price that's less than my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price that is closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum value but demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  I believe this price is a fair midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I'm hopeful it will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable value.  There's no reason to risk a counteroffer that could lead to a lower price.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
