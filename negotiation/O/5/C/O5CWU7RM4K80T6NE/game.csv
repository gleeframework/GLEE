"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for some profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the value I have in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to me is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for closer to my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a good middle ground for us both.  Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the value I have in the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and we're very close to making a deal.  I think it's in both of our best interests to close this now.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,6,
