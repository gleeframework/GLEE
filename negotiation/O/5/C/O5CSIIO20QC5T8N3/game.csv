"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $10,150 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,150, which would be $10,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
