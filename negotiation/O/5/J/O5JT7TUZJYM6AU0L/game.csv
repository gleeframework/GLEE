"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price.  How about $9,000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $8,500?  That would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,5,
