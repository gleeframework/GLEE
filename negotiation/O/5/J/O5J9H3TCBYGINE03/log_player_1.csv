Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to maximize my profit.  Bob might reject this offer, but I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to my target value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I believe this price is reasonable and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $145, which is just below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John for $150 is a better deal, there's a good chance that rejecting Bob's offer will lead to further negotiation and potentially a lower final price.  I'd rather take the sure $145 and avoid the risk of losing out on the deal entirely."
