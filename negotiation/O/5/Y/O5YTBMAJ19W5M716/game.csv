"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While we appreciate your interest in our product, we need to maintain our minimum price for this item. We're willing to negotiate further, so I propose a counteroffer of $825,000 for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
