Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to me, so I can't accept Bob's offer of $9,000. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high for $9,000. How about $10,500? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a bit more.  I'm not going to sell to John yet because I still have a chance to get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure it's worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $12,000, I'm getting closer to Bob's value, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely. $10,500 is a good compromise, and I'm happy with that outcome."
