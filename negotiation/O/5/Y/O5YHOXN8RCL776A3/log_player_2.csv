Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

$1,900,000 is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that considers the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
