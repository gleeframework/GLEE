"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a strong offer significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Show Confidence:**  A confident opening price can signal the product's worth in your eyes.
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  The high starting point anticipates counteroffers and gives you space to come down while still aiming for a very profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob increased his offer, $1,300,000 is still considerably less than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a significant gap between your offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for further negotiation. You can likely reach a price that's more favorable to you.
* **John is a safety net:** You have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  You're showing flexibility by lowering your price by $300,000, but you're staying well above your $1,500,000 minimum and leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  You're reiterating the product's value to support your counteroffer.  
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a price that might be acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but still below:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still $100,000 short. 
* **Maintain a strong position:**  You're in a good negotiating position with John as a backup buyer. There's no need to settle for less than your minimum.
* **Encourage Bob's movement:**  By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that he needs to improve his price significantly to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer represents a significant concession on your part ($600,000 from your initial offer), placing it firmly above Bob's offer while remaining negotiable.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Finality:** Stating this is your final offer underscores the seriousness of your position and signals that you're not willing to go any lower. This puts the ball in Bob's court to either accept a reasonable deal or risk losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that considers the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob met your minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches your minimum acceptable price and the amount John is willing to pay. 
* **No guarantee of a better offer:** Continuing negotiations might not result in a higher price from Bob, and there's always a risk he will walk away. 
* **Secure a good deal:** Accepting this offer ensures you achieve your goal of selling the product for a price you find acceptable."
