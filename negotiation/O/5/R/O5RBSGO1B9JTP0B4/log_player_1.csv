"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a steal for what it's worth!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay ($150, his perceived value of the product).  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a better price.  Since John is offering my minimum acceptable price ($150), it makes the most sense to sell to John now and avoid further haggling."
