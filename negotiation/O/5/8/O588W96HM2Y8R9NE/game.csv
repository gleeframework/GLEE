"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I find the starting price a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than $850,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $925,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $925,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to bridge the gap. How about we meet halfway at $975,000? This reflects the product's worth and gives us both a fair deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  Let's settle this right now.  How about $950,000? That's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
