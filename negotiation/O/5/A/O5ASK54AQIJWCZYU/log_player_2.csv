While Alice's offer is closer to my limit, I still think I can negotiate a better price. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering $1150000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice's offer is still above my limit.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that we are very close to a stalemate.  At this point, it's more efficient to go with John's offer.  It will save me time and potentially frustration."
