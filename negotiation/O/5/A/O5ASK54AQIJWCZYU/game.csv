"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $1200000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $1100000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your previous offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering $1150000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
