{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a price closer to Alice's minimum."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to your limit, there's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and your desired price. Continuing to negotiate could still lead to a more favorable outcome.  Furthermore, if Alice rejects your next counteroffer, you can always choose to buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

The negotiation has gone back and forth for a few rounds, and Alice's offer is now $1,350,000.  This is getting dangerously close to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's a chance that Alice might accept your next counteroffer, but it's risky to keep negotiating.  If she rejects it, you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  

To avoid this risk, it's wiser to buy from John at $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed transaction and ensures you get the product within your budget."
