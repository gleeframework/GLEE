"Alice, thanks for the offer. I recognize the value of the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price seems fair considering its potential value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,250,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This price reflects a compromise and ensures both of us benefit from the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,375,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to my business while respecting your bottom line.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
