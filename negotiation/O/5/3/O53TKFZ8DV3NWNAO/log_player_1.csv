Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I recognize the value of the product, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price seems fair considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $1,250,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired value of $1,450,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,375,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to my business while respecting your bottom line.
