Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message explicitly invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for potential counteroffers. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's first counteroffer if it's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $9,500 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:**  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price of $12,000, it's still a significant loss. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John provides leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is strategic:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to his perceived value ($9,500) while still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I'm framing the counter-offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the product. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer immediately, implying that I'm not desperate for a sale. This keeps the pressure on Bob to consider my offer.
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup allows me to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget, I can only consider an offer at $9,600 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  Bob's offer of $9,600 is only $400 away from my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of losing deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away entirely.  There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from him.
* **John as a backup:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, John's offer of $12,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and minimizing the risk of losing a potential buyer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent outcome considering the circumstances."
