"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special opportunity to own a product that is truly exceptional and tailored to meet your needs, valued at $12,000 by you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob's maximum value for the product is $12,000, there's room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in your product, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer of $9,000. However, to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise considering its value to you and the price you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's range:** $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum value of $12,000. 
* **Slight improvement:** While Bob initially aimed for $9,000, Alice's counteroffer is a small increase.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject and the price could go back up. It's better to secure a deal at a reasonable price than risk losing out and having to buy from John for a higher amount."
