"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I've done some research and I think it's a great item, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $8250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $7800. This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make it a serious offer.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'd like to propose a price of $7900. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand my position.",7900.0,Bob,6,
