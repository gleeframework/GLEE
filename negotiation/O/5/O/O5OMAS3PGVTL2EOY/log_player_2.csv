"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from your initial price, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce my price to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll reject the offer and continue to push for a lower price. There's still room for compromise, and I don't want to jump at the first opportunity that's within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but I'm still not comfortable at $1,350,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and is close to my maximum.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
