Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  John provides a safety net at $100 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $115, you're aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's below his perceived value, offering him a potential saving of $5.
* **Profitable for You:** It nets you a $15 profit, which is a significant markup from your minimum.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer enticing for Bob."
