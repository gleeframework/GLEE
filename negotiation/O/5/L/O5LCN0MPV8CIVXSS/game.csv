"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down a bit?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,075,000 is a tempting offer, but I have a hard limit at $1,050,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can meet you at $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1062500.0,Alice,7,
