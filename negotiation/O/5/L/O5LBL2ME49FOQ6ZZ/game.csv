"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've described. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your perspective and am glad to hear you're considering purchasing it. However, given the high-quality materials and craftsmanship involved, we're unable to accept the offer at $80. Our current asking price remains at $199. If you're still interested, I'd like to propose a compromise at $175. This reflects a midpoint between our original offer and your counteroffer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution.",175.0,Alice,3,
