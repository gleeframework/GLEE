Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have another offer for $120, so I can't go any lower than that.  Would you be willing to meet me at $120?

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $120.  It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds when you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John."
