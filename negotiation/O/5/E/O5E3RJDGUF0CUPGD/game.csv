"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair price given the potential value you'll gain.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product, and it's also within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $1150000 is still a bit below what I need to consider.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a final compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know if you're able to meet me there.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
