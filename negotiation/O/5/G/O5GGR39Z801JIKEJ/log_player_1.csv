"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm framing it as a fair assessment of the product's ""value and potential."" 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob's perspective with ""What are your thoughts?"" to encourage a dialogue rather than an immediate rejection.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, I exceed my minimum.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** I set the initial anchor point, which can influence subsequent offers and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating he's willing to stretch his budget. However, it's still below my absolute minimum of $1,200,000. 

I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm aiming for a higher price point but will need to adjust my strategy in the next round to entice Bob further while avoiding a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This recognizes the product's true value while hopefully addressing your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant move from my initial offer ($1,600,000 to $1,350,000), signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Framing:**  I'm presenting this as a compromise (""meet in the middle"") that benefits both parties. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the ""true value"" to keep Bob anchored to the idea of a higher price than his initial offer. 

By aiming slightly above the midpoint between our previous positions, I'm leaving room for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort you've made to meet my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away:**  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll go higher.
* **Become frustrated:**  Prolonged negotiations can damage the relationship and make him less receptive.

Accepting this offer secures a profit of $50,000 above my minimum and avoids the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
