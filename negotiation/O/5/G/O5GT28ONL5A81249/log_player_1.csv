"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept a price that's so far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping he'll meet me halfway and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000, and I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is just above my minimum and I believe it's a fair price, considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and accept this offer."
