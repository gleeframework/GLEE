"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You have no information about the product's actual value, and it's possible to get a better deal. It's worth exploring the negotiation process with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and get a sense of their bottom line.  It's unlikely they'll accept this first offer, but it sets the stage for a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still significantly higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to see if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is a good price.  While I'd ideally like to get it lower, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, she might increase her price again or we might not reach a deal within the remaining rounds. It's a good compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
