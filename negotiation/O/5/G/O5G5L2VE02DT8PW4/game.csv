"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
