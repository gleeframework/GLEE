"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget, but it's a good starting point. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but that price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still offers a substantial profit for her, given her valuation of $1,200,000. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is closer to your budget, but still above your preferred price point. You can likely still negotiate a better deal, so it's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $950,000 is still a bit too high, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest price. It shows willingness to negotiate while still remaining within your budget. It also highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
