"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 for this product. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price!",1080000.0,Alice,5,
