"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000 for it. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price. I want to try to negotiate further and see if I can get the price lower. It's unlikely that Alice will go as low as my target, but I want to exhaust all options before buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 for this product. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement. If that doesn't work, I'll buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her initial asking price, and we're very close to my target. While I would love to squeeze out another $30,000, it's unlikely Alice will budge further. Accepting this offer will save me $420,000 compared to buying from John.  It's time to finalize the deal."
