"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I believe this is a reasonable starting point that will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's closer to my initial offer. It's better to secure the deal now than to risk losing the sale by rejecting his offer and potentially having to counter with a lower price in the next round."
