{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While $12,000 is my maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially lower the price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while establishing a lower price point. It also gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept my initial offer."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point, but $11,000 is still higher than I want to pay.  There's room for further negotiation, and I'm not desperate enough to accept yet. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now matched my counteroffer from the previous round.  This is a good price for me, and there's no guarantee I can get it any lower.  Accepting this offer means saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's time to secure the deal."
