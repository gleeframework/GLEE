Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000. However, that's still not quite there for me.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise and allows us both to make a deal.  I'm open to discussing further, but I don't want to go lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is tempting, it's still higher than John's price of $8,000. At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better deal than what John is offering.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
