"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to save some money. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9800.0,Bob,4,
