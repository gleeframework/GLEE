"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I should try to get a better price from Alice. $120 is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product does look interesting.  How about $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a lower offer ($100) to see if Alice is willing to go down significantly. This is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is friendly but clearly states my desired price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I'm leaving myself space to negotiate upwards towards my $150 maximum if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's a great product and I think it's worth more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice didn't accept my $100 offer, she came down from her initial $120. This suggests there's still room to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Exists:** I have the option to buy from John for $150, so I'm not desperate to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a great product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's directly in between my last offer ($100) and Alice's current offer ($130).  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Competitive:**  $115 is a significant savings compared to John's $150 price, keeping the pressure on Alice to negotiate.
* **Evaluating Alice's Response:** This offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. If she rejects it outright, I may need to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $125 is a reasonable price, saving me $25 compared to buying from John. 
* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has signaled that she's not willing to go much lower than $125. 
* **Time Cost of Negotiation:**  Further haggling might only yield a small additional discount, and there's a chance Alice could walk away. It's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
