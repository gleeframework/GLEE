Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's something you'll find valuable, and this offer represents a great deal for you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's less than his perceived value) while still securing a significant profit margin for yourself. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John, willing to buy at $100, provides a safety net. You don't want to price yourself out of a sale to Bob, but you also don't need to go as low as $100."
