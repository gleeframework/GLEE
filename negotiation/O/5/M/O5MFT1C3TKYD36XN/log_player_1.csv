"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" based on the product's value, not just an arbitrary number. This helps build a foundation for a collaborative negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** My message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, I'm aiming for a much higher price. 
* **I have room to negotiate further.**  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price.** However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can achieve a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's price, demonstrating flexibility while still securing a profit above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and cooperative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Compromise:** While it's getting closer, there's still room for a higher counteroffer from me. 
* **Strategic Approach:** It's crucial to avoid settling for less than my desired price, especially with the option to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,350,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still a bit away from a deal. Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,450,000. This compromise reflects the potential benefits you'll receive from owning it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's unique benefits to justify my price and encourage Bob to see the value beyond the numbers.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a mutually beneficial solution, emphasizing collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement is increasing. 
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for my desired price, providing a safety net.

**Strategic Approach:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  While the time is getting tight, I'm confident that a few more rounds might lead to a price closer to my target. If the next round doesn't bring a better offer, I will sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below my desired price. Considering our ongoing dialogue and the unique value of this product, I'm willing to make a final concession and offer it for $1,400,000. This is a compromise that reflects the mutual benefit we can both achieve. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price and encourage Bob to see the long-term benefits.
* **Closing the Deal:** My message expresses confidence in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, urging Bob to finalize the transaction.

**Strategic Approach:**

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise while still securing a price closer to my desired target.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. This is my final and best offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to our final two rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  Selling to John secures my desired price of $1,500,000, guaranteeing a profitable outcome.
* **Limited Upside:** With Bob's final offer, there is very little chance of getting a significantly higher price in the remaining rounds.

**Strategic Approach:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to be realistic about the likelihood of reaching a favorable agreement with Bob. Given the limited time and Bob's unwillingness to budge, selling to John is the most sensible choice to maximize my profit."
