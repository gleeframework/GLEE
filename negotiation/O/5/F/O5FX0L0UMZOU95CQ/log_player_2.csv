"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know you're also interested in it at that price.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a small profit while still offering you a competitive price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's offer is $16,000, it's better to reject the offer and buy the product from John for $15,000."
