"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is considerably below the value this product offers. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic proposal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while recognizing the product's true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need you to understand the significant value this product offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This is a substantial investment on my part, reflecting my commitment to finding an agreement. Can you meet me closer to this figure?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, my absolute maximum budget for this is $800,000. If you can't meet that, I completely understand, but I won't be able to go any higher.",800000.0,Bob,6,
