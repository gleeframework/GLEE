"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway to demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal. How about we agree on $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the product's value.  To show you I'm serious about getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
