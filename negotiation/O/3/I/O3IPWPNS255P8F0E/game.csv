"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,800. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,500. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $11,500, so I'm offering it to you for $11,350. This is my final offer.",11350.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're not willing to budge from $10,200, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product to you at that price.
