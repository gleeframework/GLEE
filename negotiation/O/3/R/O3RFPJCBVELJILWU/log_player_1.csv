Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product.  If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully shows him that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like he's not willing to budge much. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still above my minimum and ensures I don't lose money."
