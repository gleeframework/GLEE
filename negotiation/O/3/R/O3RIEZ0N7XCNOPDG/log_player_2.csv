Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm trying to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $950,000 is a bit steep. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $950,000, so I'm thinking $900,000 is a fair price. Can we meet in the middle like that?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
