"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, it's still more than the product is worth to me. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still above Alice's value for the product, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $115. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my ideal price. I have 7 rounds left and can continue to negotiate. I'm confident I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $115 is still a bit high for me. How about $110? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again offering a price slightly lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates that I am actively negotiating and aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'm also being positive and reassuring Alice that we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112, which is just slightly above my preferred price point.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal is increasing with each round. Given that I have only 5 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the product.  I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
