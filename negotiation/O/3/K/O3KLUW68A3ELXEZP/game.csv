"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? That would still be a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we settle on $80? That's a good compromise and still gives you a great deal on the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
