Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than Bob's valuation ($80), but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. It also leaves me room to counteroffer if necessary.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $120 gives me confidence to be firm in negotiations with Bob. If Bob doesn't accept a reasonable offer, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even lower than my initial offer of $100. 
* **John is a Better Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground.

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? That would still be a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $85 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $60. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement.
* **Reasoning with Bob:** I've included a message explaining why this price is fair for both of us. This helps build rapport and hopefully encourages Bob to accept.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing out on value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $60 was a bit low. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer who will pay my minimum, eliminating any risk of losing out on a better deal.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $75, hoping to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we settle on $80? That's a good compromise and still gives you a great deal on the product."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $80 is only $5 away from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Still Above Minimum:** While $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's closer to my desired outcome and leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Final Offer Potential:**  This counteroffer could potentially be my final offer, as I'm already close to my desired price range. If Bob rejects, I can confidently sell to John."
