This product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and Alice is asking for $1,300,000. This means Alice is looking for a profit of $300,000.  We can likely get a better deal."

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, but this is still above my target of $800,000.  There is still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer again."
