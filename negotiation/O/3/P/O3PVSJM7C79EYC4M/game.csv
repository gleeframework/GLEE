"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this is a good product, the price is a bit high for me.  How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the potential this product holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  Perhaps we can meet somewhere closer to the middle?  I'm willing to go to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, I still believe the product's intrinsic value is higher. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000.  That's a significant move on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing this product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price. To meet you halfway, I propose a final offer of $1,175,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
