"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I initially offered.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $900,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
