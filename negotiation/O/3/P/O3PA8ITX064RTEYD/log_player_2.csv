"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. It's too early to consider buying from John, as I haven't explored all options with Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $850,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to counteroffer again to try and get the price closer to my target.  I'm still in the early rounds, so I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't benefit me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your maximum budget, Bob. However, I still believe that this product has significant value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is only $25,000 above my last counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm starting to run out of time. If I continue to reject her offer, she might get frustrated and walk away. It's also getting closer to the price John is offering.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this point, as it's still within my budget and saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
