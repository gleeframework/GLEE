"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $95. I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me, considering it's worth $100 to me and I can get it for $10 less. I'll accept her offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
