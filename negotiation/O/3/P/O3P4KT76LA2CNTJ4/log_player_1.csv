{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some negotiation room while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I can still potentially get a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
