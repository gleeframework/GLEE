"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower my price to $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm on a tight budget. I could meet you at $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final counteroffer, but I'm open to negotiating if you're willing to meet me there.",13000.0,Alice,7,
