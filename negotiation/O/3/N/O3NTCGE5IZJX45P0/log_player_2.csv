Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $662,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $675,000 and $662,500, which would be $668,750. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.

Alice is clearly very attached to getting a price above $660,000.  While we could try to push for a slightly better deal, the difference is getting small and there's a risk she won't budge much further. Accepting at $668,750 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
