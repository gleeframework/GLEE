Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value ($80), but it's also lower than Bob's estimated value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$95 is closer to my minimum value than $110, but it's still worth trying to push for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it still leaves room for further negotiation."
