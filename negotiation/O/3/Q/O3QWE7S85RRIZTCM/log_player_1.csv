"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, which may encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting further discussion, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  This is a high starting point, but I'm prepared to go lower if necessary to secure a deal before I run out of rounds or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** While I'm open to negotiation, there is still a considerable gap between our positions. 
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** It's still early in the negotiation process, and there are more rounds to try and close the gap. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, attempting to bridge the gap between our valuations while still ensuring I receive a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product, reminding Bob of its potential benefits.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I'm emphasizing the possibility of a win-win situation, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

**Next Steps:** 
If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. This price aligns better with my financial situation while still recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.
* **Strategic Play:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially with several rounds remaining. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm not ready to give up on the possibility of a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that aims to close the gap between our positions. I'll likely offer a price slightly lower than my minimum, but higher than Bob's offer, to try and reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to where we need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise on both our parts and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $975,000 is a compromise that sits midway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Signaling Flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's get this done"" phrase creates a sense of urgency, subtly implying that time is running out.

**Next Steps:** 
If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or take the safe option of selling to John for $1,000,000. The remaining rounds will be crucial in determining the outcome of this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort towards a mutual agreement. Based on my budget considerations, I would like to propose a final offer of $960,000 for your product. This price aligns closely with my financial limits while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is just $40,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Strategic Play:** I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price, especially with several rounds remaining.  Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to make a final counteroffer. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  We're in the final stages of negotiation, and a small adjustment could make the difference between accepting his offer or getting closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll make a final counteroffer that aims to close the deal.  Since there are only a few rounds left, I might compromise slightly but will try to get as close to my target price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'll accept $965,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of what I'm offering, and it allows you to stay within your budget.  Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer is a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $960,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's seal the deal"" reinforces the finality of this offer and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""fair price"" and ""value"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to make a decision.  With only three rounds remaining, I will likely sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get a price close to my minimum acceptable value.  However, if Bob is very close to accepting, I might make a small concession to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a final offer of $962,500 for your product. This price strikes a balance between respecting the value of the product and staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Very Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $962,500 is only $7,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of losing a sale to John outweighs the potential gain of trying to negotiate further.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a deal and allows me to earn a substantial amount of money.

**Next Steps:**

Since I'm accepting Bob's offer, the negotiation process will end. I have successfully sold the product for a price that is close to my target."
