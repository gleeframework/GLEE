"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is more reflective of its current market value. Would you be open to negotiating around that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
