Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** You know the product is worth $100 to both you and Bob. This is your baseline.
* **Potential Profit:** Aiming slightly higher than Bob's perceived value increases your potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $120 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $100, ensuring you don't lose money if Bob declines.
