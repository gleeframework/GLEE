"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice, seeing if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is still too high, and you have 10 rounds to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to start the conversation.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is closer to your budget, you can still potentially get a better deal. You're within striking distance of your target price, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to reach your target price, but $875,000 is still slightly above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $862,500 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $862,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm going to add a small premium to account for the value I bring to the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has raised the price again, and the negotiations seem to be going in circles. You've only got 5 rounds left. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John. You're guaranteed a lower price, and you won't risk wasting more time trying to negotiate with Alice."
