"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product, nor does it offer me a fair profit. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the value it brings to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range, I am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price point, I believe I can still get more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 still falls short of my expectations. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product at $875,000.  This is a reasonable price that reflects both the value you'll gain and my need for a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 875000}
