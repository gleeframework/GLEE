"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product, nor does it offer me a fair profit. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the value it brings to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 still falls short of my expectations. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product at $875,000.  This is a reasonable price that reflects both the value you'll gain and my need for a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further back and forth.
