Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I have that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still ensuring the deal is attractive to Bob. This leaves him with a ""consumer surplus"" ($120 - $100 = $20), making him more likely to accept.

**Why not higher?**  While you could try for a higher price, getting closer to $120 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**Why not lower?**  Going much lower than $100 leaves potential profit on the table, especially since you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $80."
