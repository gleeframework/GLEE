Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe could significantly benefit you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have valuable information â€“ Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without being too greedy and risking rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, ensuring you don't lose money if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
