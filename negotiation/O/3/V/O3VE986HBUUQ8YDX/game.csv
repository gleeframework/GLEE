"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation. Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $850,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm willing to go to $750,000. This would be a fair compromise, considering your valuation of the product and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
