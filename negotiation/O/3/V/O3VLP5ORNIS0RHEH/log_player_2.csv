It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're in the final rounds:**  This is Alice's ""final offer,"" and we're running out of rounds to negotiate.
* **Price is reasonable:**  $795,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,000,000 price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If we reject this and counter, Alice might walk away, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price."
