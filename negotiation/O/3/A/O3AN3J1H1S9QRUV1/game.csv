"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I've done my research and understand that it's worth $800,000 to you. However, considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
