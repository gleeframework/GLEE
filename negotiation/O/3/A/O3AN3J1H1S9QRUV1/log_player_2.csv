"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I've done my research and understand that it's worth $800,000 to you. However, considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what you know John will sell it for.  You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price."
