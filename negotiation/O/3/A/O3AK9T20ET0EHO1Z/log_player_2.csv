"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal. He has a clear upper limit of $1,500,000 and knows the product is worth less to Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with that price. Considering the value of the product to me and your own valuation, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal.  It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price point.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and ultimately buying from John for $1,500,000 is high. Accepting the offer at $1,350,000 ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John's offer and allows him to secure a deal."
