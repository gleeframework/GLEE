"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm very interested in your product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it.  This would allow me to make a significant investment in your product while still staying within my financial constraints.  I'm confident this price is fair considering the potential value your product offers.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1050000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close the deal!",950000.0,Bob,4,
