"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us to create a positive atmosphere.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating I'm open to discussion to encourage Bob to counteroffer and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **More negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to potentially get closer to that price.  

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from $10,000 to $9,500. This demonstrates good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer. 
* **Closing Tone:** I'm using a positive and assertive tone to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price for me. 
* **Risk/Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000,  I'm willing to take a chance with Bob for a few more rounds, hoping to get closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $9,500. This demonstrates good faith and encourages Bob to consider accepting.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.  
* **Closing Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the potential for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,000 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is firm on $9,000, and I'm unwilling to go below $9,250. 
* **Time is Limited:** We've already gone through 6 rounds, and I'm getting close to the 10-round limit. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's the most secure option at this point.  

**Conclusion:** It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a failed deal altogether."
