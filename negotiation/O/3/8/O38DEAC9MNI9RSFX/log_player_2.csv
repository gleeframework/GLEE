"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, and she's starting at $95. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  $85 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Be polite but firm.**  You want to be respectful of Alice but also stand your ground on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. How about $90 for the product? Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's moved down from $95, $90 is still above your target price of $85.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have 7 rounds remaining, so you can keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet her halfway.**  You're proposing a price in the middle between your last offer of $85 and her offer of $90.
* **Be specific and show flexibility.** You're clearly demonstrating that you want to reach a deal but are sticking to a specific price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your suggestion. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. How about we settle on $89 for the product? It's a bit closer to your offer while still reflecting its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** You're aiming for a price below $90, and she's offering $89.
* **Time is running out.** You've only got 5 rounds left, and you don't want to risk running out of time and having to buy from John at $100.
* **A small compromise is worth it.**  $89 is only $4 more than your ideal price of $85, so the compromise is relatively minor."
