Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could capture.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than your minimum.

**Strategy**

You need to strike a balance between:

* **Greed:**  Aiming too high (close to $1,200,000) risks Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Fear:** Aiming too low (close to $1,000,000) leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Justification:**  Subtly implies the high price is tied to the product's value, not just your desire to maximize profit.
* **Urgency:**  Creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Price Point:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a potential $50,000 gain while leaving you with a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  Negotiation is an art, and you could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
