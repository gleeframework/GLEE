"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for a special price of $125.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm interested in the product, but I want to save as much money as I can. Since the product is worth $150 to Alice, I'm not sure if $125 is the lowest price I can get. I'll reject Alice's offer for now and see if I can get a better deal.
