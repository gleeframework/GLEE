"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. My asking price is $1500000.  While I understand this is a substantial investment, I'm confident the product's potential will more than justify the cost.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. This keeps Bob's options open. He can now potentially negotiate with Alice or find another seller with a better price."
