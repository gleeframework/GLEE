"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $950,000 is still a significant discount from what I believe the product is worth.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would be a great win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,025,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and we're getting closer to a final agreement with Bob."
