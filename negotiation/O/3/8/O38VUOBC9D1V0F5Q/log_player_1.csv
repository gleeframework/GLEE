Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you value the product and are open to a deal.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is more than your absolute minimum, it's still lower than your desired price. We want to try and squeeze more out of this negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, we can counter-offer and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85? That's still a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $77.50 is getting closer to our desired price, we're now very close to our backup option of selling to John for $80.  The negotiation is taking time and effort, and there's no guarantee Bob will budge further.  To avoid potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale, it's best to take the safe option and sell to John."
