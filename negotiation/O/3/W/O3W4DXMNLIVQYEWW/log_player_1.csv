""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this price represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, the phrasing emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant value"" to entice him.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently sell to John at my desired price."
