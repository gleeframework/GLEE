"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. While $150 is my floor, I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price, but I'm concerned that we'll keep going back and forth. To avoid wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
