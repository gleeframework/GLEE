Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling for less than $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has incentive to counteroffer because he values the product at $12,000.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  This demonstrates you're open to a deal, but also sets a strong initial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still not the best deal possible for you. You want to get closer to the $12,000 value. By rejecting his offer, you can continue negotiations and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  How about $9,500? That's still a great price for you, considering what the product is worth. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $9,000, so I can go up to $9,200. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is a good deal. It's closer to your desired price of $10,000 and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of Bob walking away or further lowering his offer is high. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale."
