"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's also a strong starting point given the product's value to me.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not satisfied with that offer.  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still represents a good profit for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,000.  This is a good price and significantly higher than what I would get from John. It's time to close the deal and move on."
