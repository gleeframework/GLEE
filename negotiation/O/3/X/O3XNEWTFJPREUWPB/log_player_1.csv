Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is set at $18,000, it hints at the product's value. This allows Bob to consider the offer without feeling pressured by a detailed breakdown (which could be provided later if he's interested).
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This gives you leverage, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually reduce the price, but always keep your minimum ($12,000) in mind."
