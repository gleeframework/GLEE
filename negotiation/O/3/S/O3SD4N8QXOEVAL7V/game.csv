"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,3,
