"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there. It's a significant markup from my minimum, but I'm willing to adjust if necessary. I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for that low of a price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be closer to what Bob is willing to pay, but I'm still prepared to walk away if we can't find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced Bob is willing to meet my needs. I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to push him further towards a more agreeable price.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but still keeping it above my minimum. Bob is clearly trying to get a good deal, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm also not afraid to walk away.  We're getting closer to a potential deal, but I need to see more commitment from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair offer and I'm not willing to risk losing a deal.  It's important to recognize that Bob's willingness to meet my minimum is a sign he's serious about buying.  It's time to close the deal!"
