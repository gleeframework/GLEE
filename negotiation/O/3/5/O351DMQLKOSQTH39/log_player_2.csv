"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits and my current financial constraints. I'm open to further negotiation, but this is my starting point."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000? I believe this price reflects the true value it would bring to your business while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I will counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. To find a middle ground, I'm offering $1,450,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits of the product while respecting my financial limitations. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
