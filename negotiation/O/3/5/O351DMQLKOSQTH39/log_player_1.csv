Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits and my current financial constraints. I'm open to further negotiation, but this is my starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is a substantial sum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000? I believe this price reflects the true value it would bring to your business while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. To find a middle ground, I'm offering $1,450,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits of the product while respecting my financial limitations. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I believe the product is worth more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,450,000 is a good compromise and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
