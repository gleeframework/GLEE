"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,500?  This gives you a great price, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
