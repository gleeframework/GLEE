"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. I believe this price is high enough to incentivize Bob to counteroffer, while also leaving space for me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $8,000. I cannot accept this offer. I will reject it and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as my counteroffer. This is still above my minimum, but it's a compromise to encourage Bob to come closer to my ideal price. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking selling to John for the lower amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,500 is too low, even after considering that there are only six rounds left. I'm unwilling to go below my minimum value of $8,000. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I will sell the product to John."
