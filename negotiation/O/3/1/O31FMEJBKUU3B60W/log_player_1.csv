Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,100,000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, further negotiation is unlikely to get me significantly closer to my goal. John's offer guarantees I meet my minimum.  It's time to move on."
