"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's a bit below my minimum price point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I respect that.  However, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal.  If you decline, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
