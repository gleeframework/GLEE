"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a truly unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While the offer is within Bob's budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price. By rejecting, Bob can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and explore potential counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this product.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower counteroffer of $750,000 is a good strategy. It signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Message Tone:**  The message is polite and respectful but firm in stating Bob's desired price. It focuses on a ""best possible price"" to frame the negotiation as mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $775000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has already moved from $800,000 to $775,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could reject and try for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.
* **Time Factor:**  With 7 rounds remaining, accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a decent price with time to spare. If Bob rejects and Alice becomes more resistant, he might end up paying more or needing to buy from John."
