# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's worth trying to negotiate further. You have a clear upper limit of $100 with John, so there's room to potentially save even more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still think my product is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $85. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $85, which is within my budget and a good deal considering John is selling it for $100.  I'm happy to accept and save $15."
