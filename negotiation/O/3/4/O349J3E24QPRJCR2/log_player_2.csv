"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

Bob should start by making a significant counteroffer to Alice. He wants to get the price below his budget and should aim for a lower price.  A $7,500 offer gives Alice some room to negotiate but keeps the price within Bob's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for a lower price. He should try to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can reach a price closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate by offering a price closer to his maximum budget. A $7,800 counteroffer shows Alice he's serious about buying but also  indicates that he is still willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This strategy keeps the pressure on Alice to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he still has the option of getting the product from John for a lower price. He should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

Bob should continue to gradually increase his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about a deal but won't overpay.  A $7,900 counteroffer is a compromise that demonstrates Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to ""BuyFromJhon"".  While Alice's offer of $8,050 is very close to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $8,000. With only three rounds left, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a lower price outweighs the potential $50 savings. It's better to secure the deal at the price he's comfortable with and move on."
