Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value and would be a great purchase for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the price to a higher perceived worth. 
* **Positivity:**  The tone is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, making him more receptive. 

By starting high, I aim to understand Bob's willingness to pay and leave space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I started high to allow room for negotiation. Accepting immediately might leave money on the table. I'll counter to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. I value this product highly. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Anchoring:** I'm still keeping the price point relatively high, reinforcing the perceived value of the product.
* **Simplified Choice:**  Offering a single price instead of a range can make it easier for Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to balance my goal of maximizing profit with the need to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $9,800 is a significant profit above my minimum of $8,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might irritate Bob or lead to a stalemate, risking the entire deal.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting now allows me to move on to other potential deals and avoids the risk of John finding another product.

While I could potentially squeeze a little more out of the negotiation, the risk of losing the sale and settling for $8,000 with John makes accepting $9,800 the most logical decision."
