I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a strong starting point. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $25,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise.  While you'd prefer a lower price, it's still a significant saving compared to John's price and a fair deal considering the product's value to you."
