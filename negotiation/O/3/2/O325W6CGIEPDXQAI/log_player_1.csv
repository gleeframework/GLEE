"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't leave too much money on the table. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer is designed to gauge how eager Bob is to buy and how far he might be willing to go. 
* **John as Leverage:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer gives me a strong position and allows me to be more assertive in my initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. I believe there's room to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I make a significant concession to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** I'm still above Bob's perceived value, but the lower price might make him more receptive to further negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware of the 10-round limit. While I have John as a backup, securing a deal with Bob sooner rather than later is preferable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has now offered a price above his perceived value, indicating strong interest. This price is also only slightly below my desired minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Waiting for a potentially better offer in later rounds has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures a substantial profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting the $1,000,000 offer represents a good balance between risk and reward."
