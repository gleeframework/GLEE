"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, however, I know the real value of this product and $8,500 is just too low.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really looking for something closer to my original offer of $8,500.  Would you consider coming down a little more?",8500.0,Bob,4,
