"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll do my best to stay within my budget. How about we aim for $10,500? It's a bit higher than my initial offer but still lower than your current proposal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price that's closer to both of our positions.  Let me know if this works for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $11,000 as a compromise between our positions. This would allow me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of your product.",11000.0,Bob,6,
