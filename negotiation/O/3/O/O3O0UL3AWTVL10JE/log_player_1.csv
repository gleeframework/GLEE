Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the value it brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows me to potentially increase the price further if Bob counteroffers.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with a safety net and gives me leverage in negotiations. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving open the possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  John's offer provides me with a fallback option, ensuring I won't lose out if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the potential for a more favorable deal while still having a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value.  
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise and making the deal work, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm lowering the price, I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out. 

This counter-offer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and staying open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $825,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $825,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Further Negotiation is Uncertain:**  While I could counter-offer again, there's no guarantee Bob will come up further. It's possible we'll get stuck in a cycle of increasingly small counter-offers.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** There's always a risk that Bob might walk away entirely if I keep rejecting his offers. 

Considering the potential for a stalemate, and the fact that I'm already close to my minimum, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to ensure a sale and maximize my profit."
