"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This would still give you a profit on the sale and would be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
