"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to invest at a slightly lower price point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to invest at a lower price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000.  It's getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to meet you at $930,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize the deal.",930000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're almost there!  I'm willing to go up to $928,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",928000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $928,000. I'm willing to meet you at $935,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. Let's see if we can push the needle a bit further.",935000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, but we're getting close to a point where we're both going to walk away without a deal.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $931,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to let this opportunity slip away.",931000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $931,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $936,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",936000.0,Alice,9,
