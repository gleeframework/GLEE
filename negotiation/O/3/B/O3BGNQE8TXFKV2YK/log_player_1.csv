"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and what I know the product is worth to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion. 
* **Direct offer:** I'm clearly stating my desired price. 

This approach sets the stage for negotiation while also making it clear that I'm not giving away the product cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial value, there's still room for a counteroffer that benefits both of us.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I'm optimistic about reaching a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, highlighting its benefits for Bob.
* **Finding common ground:** The counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while keeping my price above my minimum. 
* **Continuing the dialogue:** The message keeps the conversation open and invites further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $145. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob is closer to my minimum price, $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for a higher price:** I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I'm already above Bob's initial value. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I'm not willing to give up just yet on a potentially higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and aim for a deal that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $145 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $152.50. This way, we both get a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 152.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is exactly in the middle between my previous offer ($160) and Bob's offer ($145). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is still friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation open and positive. 
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer significantly reduces the difference between our desired prices, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $152.50, but I'm willing to go up to $148. This is my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $148 is very close to my minimum price of $150, it's still below it.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing.
* **Safe option:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, the time constraint and the possibility of Bob not budging further makes selling to John the more secure choice."
