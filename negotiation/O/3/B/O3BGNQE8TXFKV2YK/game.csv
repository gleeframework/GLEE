"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can agree on this.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $145. Let me know what you think.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $145 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $152.50. This way, we both get a fair price. What do you say?",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $152.50, but I'm willing to go up to $148. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",148.0,Bob,6,
