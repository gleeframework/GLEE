Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.
