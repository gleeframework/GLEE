"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still leaves you with a nice profit margin. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11.50. Can you consider that?",1150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $11,500 is still significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need to stay at $12,000. If you're not willing to go higher, I may need to explore other options. ",12000.0,Alice,5,
