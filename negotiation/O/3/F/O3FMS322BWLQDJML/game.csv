"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $8500 to see if we can find a middle ground.  This still leaves us both with a good deal, and I'm confident you won't find this product for this price elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,
