Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a range that's very profitable for me.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
