"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the concession, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its true value to me, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
