"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so a counteroffer of $950,000 is a bold move. It's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation. This aggressive approach might push Alice to accept the offer quickly, or it might lead to further rounds of bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to squeeze out more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his maximum budget, and he has a strong alternative offer from John for $1,000,000.  This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice.  If she rejects, Bob can walk away and get the product from John. Alice is more likely to accept this offer to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,020,000 is only slightly better than John's price of $1,000,000. The potential for further negotiation is limited, and the risk of continuing to bargain is that Alice might reject future offers, and Bob might end up with nothing.  It's more beneficial to secure the product at a price close to his maximum budget.  Bob should go with the sure thing and buy from John."
