"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. It's worthwhile to try and get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a significant step away from where I see the product's true value.  Would you consider $1,225,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to bring the price down further."
