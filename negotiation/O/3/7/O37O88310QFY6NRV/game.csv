"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a significant step away from where I see the product's true value.  Would you consider $1,225,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
