"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it leaves room for both of us to make a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
