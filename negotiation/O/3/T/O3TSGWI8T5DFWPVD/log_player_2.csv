Alice's offer is far too high.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, $8,000.  It's a fair price based on what I'm willing to pay, and it's a significant reduction from her initial offer."

Alice's offer is still too high. I will continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."

I'm offering a bit more than my initial offer, but still significantly less than Alice's price. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I won't go above a certain price point."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is a significant reduction from Alice's latest offer and still within my acceptable range."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to my acceptable range, but it's still too high.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's not clear that I'll be able to get a better price from Alice. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000."
