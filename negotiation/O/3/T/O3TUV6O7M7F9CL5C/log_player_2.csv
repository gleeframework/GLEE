"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000), we leave room for negotiation and try to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest, but clearly indicates that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to bring Alice closer to our desired price range while leaving us the option to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective, this product holds significant value, and $600,000 is considerably below its worth.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $900,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and potential for return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $900,000 is still significantly above our $800,000 maximum budget and the price John is offering.
* **Negotiation Room:** There are several rounds left, so we have time to negotiate further and try to get Alice closer to a more reasonable price.
* **John as Backup:**  We have the security of knowing we can always buy from John for $800,000 if needed."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to considering a price of $700,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's worth and my financial constraints."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:** We are making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving forward and signal our willingness to find a compromise.
* **Significant Increase:** We increased our offer by $100,000, a substantial jump that demonstrates serious interest while staying within our budget.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Alice's last offer ($900,000) and our previous offer ($600,000). 
* **Time Constraint:** We are getting closer to our 10-round limit and need to move the negotiation towards a price we can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I have to be realistic about the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price reflects its potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is getting closer to our $800,000 limit, but we are still not there yet.
* **Leverage:**  We still have several rounds of negotiation and can leverage our ability to buy from John to push Alice further down. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting $850,000 is a possibility if we can't get lower, but it's worth risking another round or two to see if we can save an additional $50,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, I'm on a tight budget and $850,000 is pushing it.  My best offer is $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while working within my financial constraints."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We are conveying a sense of firmness with this offer, letting Alice know we are reaching our limit, while still maintaining a respectful and collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Increase:** We are only increasing our offer by $50,000 this round, signaling that we are getting close to our final price. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, we need to apply a bit more pressure to reach an agreement without running out of time. 
* **Backup Plan:** We still have the option of buying from John for $800,000, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be upfront â€“ I can't accept anything less than $800,000 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value it brings. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice has met our maximum budget of $800,000.
* **No Need to Risk Further:** We already have a matching offer from John, so there is no benefit to rejecting this offer and risking losing the product or paying the same price elsewhere.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now closes the deal quickly and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations with an uncertain outcome."
