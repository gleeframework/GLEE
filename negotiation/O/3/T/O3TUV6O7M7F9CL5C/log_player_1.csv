"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective, this product holds significant value, and $600,000 is considerably below its worth.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $900,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and potential for return."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to considering a price of $700,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's worth and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We're still significantly below our desired price and John's guaranteed offer. It's worth making another counteroffer to see if we can push Bob closer to $800,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I have to be realistic about the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price reflects its potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 850000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, I'm on a tight budget and $850,000 is pushing it.  My best offer is $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while working within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob has come up to $750,000, he's still significantly below the product's value to both you and him. He's also indicating this is his ""best offer,"" which may be a negotiating tactic. Given we have rounds left and a guaranteed offer from John, it's worth taking a calculated risk to see if we can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be upfront â€“ I can't accept anything less than $800,000 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value it brings. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, we're getting closer to a critical decision point. By offering $800,000, we're:

* **Signaling firmness:** We've come down from our initial ask, but we're drawing a clear line that this is our bottom line. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to him, so this offer highlights the fairness for both parties. 
* **Creating urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining, this firm stance encourages Bob to make a decision.

If Bob rejects this offer, we'll need to seriously consider John's offer to avoid the risk of Bob not meeting our valuation in the remaining rounds."
