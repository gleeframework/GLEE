"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to pay, and you have an alternative option to buy from John at the same price, it's best to go with John. There's no potential for saving money by negotiating with Alice."
