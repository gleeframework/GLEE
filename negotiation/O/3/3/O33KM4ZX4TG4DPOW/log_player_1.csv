While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can secure a better price."

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds left, Bob has not budged from $1,225,000. This is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum. I can't risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer from Bob or even worse, no deal at all."
