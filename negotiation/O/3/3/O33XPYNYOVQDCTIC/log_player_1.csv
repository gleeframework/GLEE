Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $10,000, offering it slightly above that gives him an incentive to buy.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
