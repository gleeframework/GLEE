Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting at $15,000 provides room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning other potential buyers (even though John's offer is the same) might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially pay a premium.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone of the message is friendly and suggestive, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 

It's a balancing act between maximizing profit and not pushing Bob away completely, leading him to reject the offer outright."
