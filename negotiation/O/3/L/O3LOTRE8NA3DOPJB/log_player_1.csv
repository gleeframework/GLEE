Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is a strong offer.  While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Securing this price is a significant gain compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
