"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit. I'm confident the product's value to Bob is likely higher than $800,000, as that's my minimum. This allows for negotiation space."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still lower than I initially aimed for. I want to see if I can push for a higher offer in the next round. There's still a chance Bob is willing to pay more, and I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John at the minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding firm at a price that represents a good profit for me.  I'm showing flexibility, but also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer.  I've shown willingness to compromise, but Bob's offer is still too low. I'm hoping to get him back up to my last offer, and I believe there's room for that to happen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're at a crossroads. Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I'm not sure if I can get him to budge higher.  Since we're at the halfway point of the rounds, it's time to be practical.  I've shown I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't want to risk losing out on any profit by continuing to haggle. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I'm confident I've explored the negotiation with Bob as much as possible."
