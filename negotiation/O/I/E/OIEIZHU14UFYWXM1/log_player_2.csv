Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **You're saving a significant amount:** $1,050,000 is a $450,000 savings compared to John's offer.
* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** She's already indicated this is her lowest price.
* **You're getting closer to your limit:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, leaving you with John's less attractive offer."
