"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my research on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still within a reasonable range.  However, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I believe I can secure a higher offer by continuing negotiations.  I will counter Bob's offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand it's important to be within your budget, but $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the product's true value. How about we compromise at $1,600,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I am confident that I won't be able to get a significantly higher offer from Bob.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, as it allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
