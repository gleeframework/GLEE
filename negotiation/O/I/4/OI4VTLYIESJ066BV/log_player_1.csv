Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $98. Can we meet at that price?

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  At this point, it's more profitable to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
