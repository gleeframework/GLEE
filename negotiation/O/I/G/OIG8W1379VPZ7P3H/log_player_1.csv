Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) might be perceived as too aggressive and could make him more likely to reject the offer.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and going with the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
