"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $6,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $7,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to take a small step back to $7,200. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet at this price.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon. How about $7,100?",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're eager to close the deal, but I'm not quite ready to give in yet. I'll meet you at $7,200, but I'm not budging from there. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,200, but I need you to meet me at this price.",7200.0,Alice,7,
