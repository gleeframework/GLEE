"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the product's value to you. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,800 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value. Let me know what you think.",11150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's the highest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,4,
