,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer still gives you a substantial benefit and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
