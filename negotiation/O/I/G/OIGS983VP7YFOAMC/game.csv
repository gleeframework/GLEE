"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product,  $1500000 is at the upper end of my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the feedback, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1400000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable at this point.  I'm prepared to go to $1350000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer $1375000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, but I'm excited about the possibility of working with you.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
