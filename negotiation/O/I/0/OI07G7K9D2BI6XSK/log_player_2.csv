"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a far too high of a price. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should start by offering the absolute maximum he's willing to pay. This establishes a strong baseline and gives him room to negotiate if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's limit. There's room to negotiate further, and rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob should continue to gradually increase his offer, but stay within his budget. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also sets a firm price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers and try to negotiate a lower price. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to his limit, there's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he should continue to negotiate. He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying, but he's not willing to overpay. A counteroffer of $1,000,000 keeps the negotiation moving and might be more appealing to Alice than the previous offers."
