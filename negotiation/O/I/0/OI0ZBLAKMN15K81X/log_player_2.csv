"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $12,000, which is the maximum you're willing to pay. However, you have a backup option of buying from John for the same price.  Therefore, you can reject Alice's offer and still get the product for the same price from John."
