"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-end product. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the exclusivity of this opportunity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground, so I'm counteroffering $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the exclusivity of this opportunity. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. I'm willing to come down to $14000, but I need you to meet me at this price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm starting to lose patience. This is my final offer. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your frustration, but $14000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $13000 is my absolute final offer. Let me know if you accept.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm not willing to accept $13000, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to reach a deal. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need you to understand that I'm not going to go any lower than $14000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. This is my final offer. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,9,
