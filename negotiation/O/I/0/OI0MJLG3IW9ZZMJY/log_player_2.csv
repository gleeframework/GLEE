# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000.  This is a unique item with a value of at least $800,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects that.  While I have another buyer lined up at $800,000, I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable arrangement.  Let me know what you think.
