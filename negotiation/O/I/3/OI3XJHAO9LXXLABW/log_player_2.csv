It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further.  You can potentially get a better price than $1,100,000, and still save money compared to buying from John."

Buying from Alice for $1,080,000 is still a good deal, as it's lower than buying from John. It's also likely that Alice won't budge further, so there's little to gain from further negotiation."
