"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its high value. This offer won't last long, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $140.** This is less than the $150 you're willing to pay for the product.
* **Buying from John would cost you $150.**  
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10.** 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save money."
