"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. My initial offer is $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $850,000 to make it work. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price if we keep talking.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm very serious about buying this product, but I need to be closer to $900,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I still need to make a significant profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer for now.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is my final offer for now. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I may need to consider other options.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $920,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which would normally cost $20,000. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some added value. I'm sticking with my price of $920,000.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added extras, and they are definitely valuable. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000. If you can come down to $905,000, I'd be happy to accept. This would give us both a good deal.",905000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already given you a lot of value with the added extras. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $905,000 and $920,000, which is $912,500. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. This is my final offer.",912500.0,Alice,9,
