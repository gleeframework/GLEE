"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate. Since I have a backup offer from John, I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm lowering my offer to $1,350,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price higher than his initial offer. This should encourage him to meet me halfway."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,100,000.

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm confident that John will be a good backup option, and I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a final attempt to meet Bob halfway. With only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic.  I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to go with John if necessary."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob, I'm running out of time and rounds. John's offer is my safety net, and with only two rounds left, I'm not willing to risk losing both deals.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 than to gamble on another round with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
