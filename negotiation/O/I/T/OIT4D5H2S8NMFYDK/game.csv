"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it aligns with the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
