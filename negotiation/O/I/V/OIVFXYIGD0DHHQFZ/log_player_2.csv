"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential it holds for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob is aiming to get the product for no more than $800,000, so he should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in this opportunity.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and propose a counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be open to meeting at $975,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and continue to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $912,500. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to the value I see in this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, and for working to find common ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $912,500. How about we meet in the middle at $943,750? This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $943,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $943,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Although she claims it's her final offer, Bob has another option: buying from John.  There is still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to see if Alice is willing to come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have another interested buyer, but $943,750 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer and is closer to the price I need to be able to move forward with this purchase.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
