Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice seems firm at $12,000.  It's unlikely she'll go lower and I have a guaranteed option at $10,000 with John."
