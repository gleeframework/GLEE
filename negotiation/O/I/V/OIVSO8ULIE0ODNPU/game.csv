"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, especially to someone with your plans for it, is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is closer to the middle ground we were aiming for. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I'm motivated to sell, I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference once more and settle on $1,187,500? This reflects the value this product brings and allows us both to walk away feeling positive about the deal.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
