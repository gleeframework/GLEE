"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,350,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, especially to someone with your plans for it, is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  How about $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying. There's still some room to negotiate and try to get a lower price. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue the negotiation process."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is closer to the middle ground we were aiming for. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I'm motivated to sell, I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference once more and settle on $1,187,500? This reflects the value this product brings and allows us both to walk away feeling positive about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $1,187,500. This is a bit higher than your counteroffer of $1,150,000, but it's still within your budget of $1,500,000. It's getting close to your target price and it's possible she won't go lower.  It's in your best interest to accept the offer and avoid the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer or you losing out on the product by buying from John."
