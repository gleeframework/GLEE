Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
