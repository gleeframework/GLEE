Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching for Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate based on his counteroffer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below it. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe bet, I'm willing to take a slight risk to try and maximize my profits.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $900,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation, I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give in too easily.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his next move.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to consider if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm willing to take a slight risk to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll need to carefully consider the risk of losing Bob as a buyer versus the potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand you're looking to save, $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  To make this work, I'd need to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but am not willing to go too low.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable middle ground.
* **Focus on Mutual Needs:** I'm emphasizing that this price considers both of our needs. This helps to create a sense of collaboration and understanding. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer.
* **Evaluate Options:** Based on Bob's response, I'll need to evaluate my options. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to consider whether I'm willing to continue negotiating or if I should sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $925,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We're at a stalemate, and it's unlikely he'll move much closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I would prefer to earn more, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. There's a strong chance he'll continue to haggle, and I could end up selling for a price much lower than my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirements. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale. It's time to move on and secure the best possible deal, even if it means accepting a slightly lower price than I initially hoped for."
