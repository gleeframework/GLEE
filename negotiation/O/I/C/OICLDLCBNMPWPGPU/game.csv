"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is still well above your value for it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I understand it's still below your valuation, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price represents a significant savings for you compared to John's offer, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to compromise on the price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
