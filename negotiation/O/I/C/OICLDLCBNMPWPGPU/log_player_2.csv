"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I understand it's still below your valuation, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your desired price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get her down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to compromise on the price. What do you think?

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer.  You're getting the product for $1,150,000, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll end up having to buy from John at a much higher price."
