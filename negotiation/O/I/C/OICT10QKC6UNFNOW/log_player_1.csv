Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than John's offer:** This ensures you're getting a better price if Bob rejects.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept or at least counteroffer. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It makes it easy for Bob to understand your proposal.

By starting with a strong initial offer, you set the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, it's much closer to John's offer.  I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet. There's a chance I can get closer to my initial offer by counter-offering.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay more, given the product's value to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth, and it ensures I get a fair return on my investment. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000 and significantly better than John's offer. Considering the possibility of further negotiations being unproductive, accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable profit and closes the deal."
