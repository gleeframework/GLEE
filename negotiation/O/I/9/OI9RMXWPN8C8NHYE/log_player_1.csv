Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob's maximum valuation is $800,000, Alice starts high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate while staying well above Alice's minimum price.
* **Justification and urgency:** The message emphasizes the product's value and encourages a prompt decision from Bob.

**Strategy:**

Alice aims to secure a deal significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while leaving room for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at her minimum acceptable price."
