"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a good price, you can potentially get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is a good price for the product.  It's a $5 improvement over her initial offer and is within my budget. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price.  It's better than risking further negotiations with Alice or going to John for a higher price."
