Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that it's likely to immediately scare Bob off.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is still a significant profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a profitable deal for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can finally agree on a price."
