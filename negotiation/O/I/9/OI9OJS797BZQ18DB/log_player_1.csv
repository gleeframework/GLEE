{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still attractive to Bob, but significantly higher than his perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John gives me the confidence to hold firm if Bob makes a very low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $9,500 I initially offered, and I'm not comfortable settling for such a large discount. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my target, hoping Bob will come up.
* **John is the Backup:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm and potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""Let me know if you're interested"" keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to respond.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,200. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,200 is now significantly below my minimum price point of $10,000.  
* **Further Negotiation is Unlikely:**  While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, he's already rejected several offers, and it's unlikely he'll come much closer to my minimum.
* **John is the Safe Choice:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome, ensuring I don't lose out on significant value. 

With John's offer being my minimum, and Bob unlikely to come closer to that, the logical choice is to accept John's offer and move on."
