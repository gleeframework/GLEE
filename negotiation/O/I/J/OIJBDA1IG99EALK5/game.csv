"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? I appreciate your understanding.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows for a fair profit margin for me.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
