"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $100 to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $70?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $90 is still too high. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer to test her willingness to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to my budget."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $90, which would be $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. $82.50 is a good price, significantly lower than John's offer, and further negotiation might annoy Alice and risk losing the deal."
