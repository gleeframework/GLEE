"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and should be a good compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
