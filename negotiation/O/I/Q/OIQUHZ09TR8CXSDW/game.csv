"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high for you. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, $9,500 is still quite low for me.  How about we land at $12,500? This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
