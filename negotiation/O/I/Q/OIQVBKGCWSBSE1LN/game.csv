"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make the most of this product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
