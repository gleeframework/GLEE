"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredible value in. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start negotiations below your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but clearly states that the initial price is too high. 
* **Significant Reduction:**  The counter-offer of $1,000,000 is a substantial reduction from $1,300,000, which might encourage Alice to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice is unwilling to go as low as $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move down to $1,200,000. This product truly offers exceptional value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. There's space between $1,200,000 and our target of under $1,100,000.
* **John as Backup:** We have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000, so there's less pressure to accept a price we're not comfortable with.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting this offer, we can make a counter-offer closer to our target price, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer directly proposes meeting in the middle of the current price gap ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000 difference; splitting it puts us at $1,100,000).
* **Clear and Simple:** This offer is easy for Alice to understand and evaluate.
* **Reaching a Decision Point:**  By proposing a price close to our target, we're pushing for a decision. Alice is likely to either accept, counter with a smaller concession, or the negotiations might stall, at which point we'd consider John's offer."
