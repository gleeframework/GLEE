"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
We can do better than $9,500. Alice is clearly trying to oversell the product and we have a backup option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, we open the door for a potential counter-offer or can proceed with John's $10,000 offer if necessary."
