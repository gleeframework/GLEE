"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds for you will make it a worthwhile acquisition.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, my budget is set at $800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, however,  $800000 is significantly below the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product holds.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $800000 is the maximum I can reasonably spend on this product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
