# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to the product's value as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high, exceeding my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1050000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get it closer to $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant investment for me. If this price doesn't work for you, I'm open to discussing other options, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
