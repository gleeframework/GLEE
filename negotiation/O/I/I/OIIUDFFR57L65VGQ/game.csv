"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be open to that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13500.0,Alice,5,
