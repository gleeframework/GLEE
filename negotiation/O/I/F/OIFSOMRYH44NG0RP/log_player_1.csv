"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price but still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering he values the product at $15,000.  I want to see if I can get a good initial price before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit. I believe there's room for compromise and hope to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and not too far from my initial offer.  While I'd love to get even more, I'm happy with this deal and don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
