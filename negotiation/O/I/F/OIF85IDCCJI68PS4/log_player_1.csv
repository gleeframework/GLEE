{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity and I believe it's priced very competitively. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It's also framed as a great opportunity to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the competitive pricing, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a slight compromise, but still above my minimum, to see if Bob will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still aiming to keep within my budget of $12000. Would it be possible to negotiate further? Perhaps we could aim for $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has already made two counteroffers and is clearly sticking to his budget. It's a good deal for me compared to my minimum, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000. I'll accept his offer."
