"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. I'm confident that the product's worth to you is substantial, and I'm prepared to negotiate a fair deal. Please consider this price: $1450000. This allows me to secure a significant profit while still presenting you with an attractive opportunity. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation:** Alice is willing to sell the product for $1,450,000, while it's worth $1,200,000 to her. This suggests she has room to negotiate further.
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is still within your budget.
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal your willingness to walk away, giving you leverage to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options.

**Strategy:** It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or potentially explore other options.  You have a backup with John, so you're not in a desperate situation."
