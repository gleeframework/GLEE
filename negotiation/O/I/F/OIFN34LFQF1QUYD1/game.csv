"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price slightly to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to secure a fair value for my product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm ready to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my maximum while still providing you with a decent return. Let's see if we can finalize this.",825000.0,Bob,4,
