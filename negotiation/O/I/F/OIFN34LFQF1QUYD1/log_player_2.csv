``` 
 
This product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $900,000. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  It is likely Alice will be willing to accept a lower price to avoid the risk of no sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price slightly to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to secure a fair value for my product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high for Bob. There's room for more negotiation. Bob can try to push for a price closer to his maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm ready to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my maximum while still providing you with a decent return. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 825000}
