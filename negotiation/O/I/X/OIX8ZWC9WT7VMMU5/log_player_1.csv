Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you're well above your minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning that the product is worth $120 to Bob, you're emphasizing the value proposition.
* **Create Urgency:** By framing it as a ""great deal for both of us,"" you subtly imply that this offer might not last. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different prices and messaging to see what works best in your negotiations."
