"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is significantly below my initial estimate. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This price is still fair considering your own valuation and the potential benefits I anticipate. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value to me while also acknowledging your profit margin.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.  ",1050000.0,Bob,4,
