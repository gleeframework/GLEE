"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for it. This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints. ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm closer to your price, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go above $9,500. It's a significant amount for me, and I'm not sure I can justify going higher.  Perhaps we can split the difference?  I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,000.
