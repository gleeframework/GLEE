# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. In response, I propose a price of $887,500 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her current offer is only $25,000 higher than your last counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more savings.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price well below your initial limit and saves a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
