"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the value while working within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move us closer, I'd be willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This offer reflects a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the value of your product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. However, $850,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. I understand that this price represents a compromise for you, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Could we settle at $875,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while staying within a reasonable budget.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  While $875,000 is a respectable offer, I'm looking for something closer to my last offer.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $912,500?  This reflects a significant investment from both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both feel good about.",912500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  However, to be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling for this product is $890,000.  If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",890000.0,Bob,8,
