"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is the best I can do, but I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me there. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
