Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you and gives me a fair return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject his offer and try to get him closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still not at a point where I can make the sale.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.

While $8,900 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try to get Bob a little higher in the next round.  I'm not too worried about selling to John yet, since we are getting closer to a deal with Bob."
