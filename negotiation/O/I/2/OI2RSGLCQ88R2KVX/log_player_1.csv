I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it leaves some room for negotiation. I am confident that I can get a better price than John's offer if I am able to negotiate effectively with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more and see if I can get him to come up to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm making a counteroffer to Bob for $1,550,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to him and only slightly less than what John is offering. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his last offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better outcome is too high. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to secure a price that meets my minimum."
