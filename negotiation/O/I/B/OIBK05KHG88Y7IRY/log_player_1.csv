Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to discuss a lower price. How about $10,000?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000?  I'm really hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is offering $11,000 which is a profit of $3,000 for Alice. It's getting closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer from Bob.
