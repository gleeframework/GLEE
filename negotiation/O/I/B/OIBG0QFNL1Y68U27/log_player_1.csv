{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your minimum desired price of $10,000.  It's worth exploring if we can reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum desired price of $10,000 and close to my previous offer of $13,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
