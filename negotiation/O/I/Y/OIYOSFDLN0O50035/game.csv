"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to your organization.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $650000, which is still a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to your business justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll propose a new price of $725000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to your organization.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $700000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a good offer, but I'm still not convinced that it reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $750000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",750000.0,Alice,5,
