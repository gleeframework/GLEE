Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a little out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is getting closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate and can likely secure a better price.  He can try to counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  Let's compromise at $9,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's very close to his maximum budget, he can still try to get a better deal. He has only a few rounds left, so he should try to negotiate further.  If he can't get a lower price, he can always buy from John for $8,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
