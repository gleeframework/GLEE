"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm thinking of starting with a price of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is only $10 below my maximum price. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I can see that you're willing to pay $90, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met me at her value for the product. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a lower price, and this offer saves me $20 compared to buying from John."
