Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This allows room for negotiation and gives me some leverage. I believe this price is a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying and to understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $19,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while also indicating that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob offered.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to go through another round of negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my last counteroffer, and it's higher than my minimum acceptable value.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price isn't worth it, and it's better to secure the sale at a good price."
