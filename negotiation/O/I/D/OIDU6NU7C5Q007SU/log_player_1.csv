Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as a compromise. It's a significant step down from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay a little more. This is a reasonable price considering I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear he's not willing to pay what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to sell to John for $8,000, which is my minimum and guarantees I don't lose money."
