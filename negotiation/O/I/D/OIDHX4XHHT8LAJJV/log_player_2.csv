Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $900,000 is still too high for him, and he wants to see if he can negotiate a lower price."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay less,  $885,000 is still a good deal for him. He saves a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't go lower."
