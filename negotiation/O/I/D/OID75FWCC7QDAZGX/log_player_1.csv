Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might counteroffer. This allows me to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get more. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum value, and it's a better offer than John's. I'm willing to accept his offer to finalize the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
