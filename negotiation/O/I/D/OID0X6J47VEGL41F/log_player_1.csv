Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $22,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I could consider something closer to $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $10,000 is simply too low for what this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment at that price."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
