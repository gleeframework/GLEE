"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm looking for a price around $22,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $22,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I could consider something closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $10,000 is simply too low for what this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment at that price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $18,000 is still outside my budget.  Could we possibly settle on $13,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  To be completely transparent, $13,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. Could we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm willing to compromise to make this a win-win.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle on $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we wrap this up right now - $15,500, and we have a deal.",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $14,750.  If that works for you, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John.",14750.0,Bob,8,
