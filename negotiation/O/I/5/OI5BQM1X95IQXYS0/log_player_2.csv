"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still higher than Alice's value for the product, but lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also ensuring a significant saving for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation and Bob is better off trying to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to make a small profit, making it a potentially agreeable deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $12,000. However, the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming. At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John.  Although it's not the ideal price, it guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
