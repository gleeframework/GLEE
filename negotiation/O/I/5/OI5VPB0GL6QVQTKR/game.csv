"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, as it's still a great deal for me. Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",8250.0,Bob,4,
