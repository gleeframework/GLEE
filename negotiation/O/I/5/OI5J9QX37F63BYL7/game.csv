,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still finding $85 a bit high. Would you be open to $75? That would be a price point I'm more comfortable with.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",82.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, my absolute top price is $78.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is your top price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $79. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",79.0,Alice,7,
