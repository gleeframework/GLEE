"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than his perceived value ($120) but still above my minimum price ($80). This should encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still a good price for me.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is now very close to my desired price range and above the price John is willing to pay.  I'll accept this offer to close the deal."
