{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:**  There's room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to accept.
* **Fair:**  It's a substantial discount for Bob from his perceived value, making it a potentially attractive deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it leaves plenty of room for profit on your end. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered, and you can likely get a better deal.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation open and signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a higher price.  You're also gaining valuable information about Bob's maximum offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves plenty of room for both of us to make a profit. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **A compromise:** It's a significant reduction from your initial offer but still higher than Bob's.
* **Fair:** It still allows Bob to purchase the product at a price that's significantly lower than what it's worth to him.
* **Firm:**  You've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate but are clearly not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise that still leaves you a good profit. Let's seal this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and it's still a good deal for you, leaving a comfortable profit margin. While you could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with John's lower offer. It's generally wise to accept a good offer when it's available, especially when there's a risk of losing the deal entirely."
