"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves plenty of room for both of us to make a profit.

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise that still leaves you a good profit. Let's seal this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
