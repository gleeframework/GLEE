"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to close the deal quickly, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's previous low offer.  If he rejects, I'll continue negotiating, but I will not go lower than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting more and more unreasonable.  I'm going to reject his offer again. While I am tempted to sell to John, I'd still like to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000.  This is my absolute bottom line.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, as we are halfway through our negotiation rounds.  However, I'm still confident Bob will come around to a price that is acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm starting to lose patience with Bob's stubborn negotiation tactics.  He's clearly not willing to meet me halfway.  I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, and it seems like he's just trying to wear me down. 

Since I've reached a point where I'm unsure if we can reach an agreement, I'm going to choose to sell to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price, and it prevents further frustration with Bob."
