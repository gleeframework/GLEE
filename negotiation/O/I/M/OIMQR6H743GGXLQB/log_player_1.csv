{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging message to create a good first impression.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to pique Bob's interest.

This offer allows for potential negotiation while ensuring I don't undervalue my product. I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9000.  I'm confident the product is worth it, but that's my budget for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to negotiate a price that is more favorable to me.  I'm confident I can secure a better price than $9,000, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
