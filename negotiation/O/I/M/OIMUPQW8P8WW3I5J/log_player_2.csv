"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000 yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's target price, and he doesn't want to risk further negotiation if he can get the product for less from John. It's better to guarantee the purchase at his maximum budget than to risk a higher price or a failed negotiation."
