"I appreciate your offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000 yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
