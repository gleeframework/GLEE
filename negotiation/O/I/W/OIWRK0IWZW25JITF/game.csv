"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to start the conversation at $1,500,000.  I know that's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's justified by the value this product will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's try to find some middle ground - would you be willing to go up to $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement with you, I also have other interested buyers. To be completely transparent, I have an offer for $1,200,000 already on the table. If you can meet that price, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider my other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
