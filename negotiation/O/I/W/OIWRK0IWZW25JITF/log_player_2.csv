Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to start the conversation at $1,500,000.  I know that's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's justified by the value this product will bring you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's try to find some middle ground - would you be willing to go up to $1,350,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement with you, I also have other interested buyers. To be completely transparent, I have an offer for $1,200,000 already on the table. If you can meet that price, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider my other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and revealed her bottom line is $1,200,000.  This is more than your absolute limit ($1,000,000) and equal to her own product valuation. It's unlikely she'll go lower.  You can secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, guaranteeing you stay within budget."
