I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum value ($15,000), hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value, but I'm also open to some compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000.  It's still above Bob's offer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise. I hope this will encourage him to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm starting to feel like I won't be able to get a price close to my minimum. It's better to sell to John now for $15,000."
