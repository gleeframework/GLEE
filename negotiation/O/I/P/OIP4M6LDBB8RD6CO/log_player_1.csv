Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to get a better deal from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum price, but I'll try to push for a bit more before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I can't go any lower than $82.  This product is truly special, and I believe you'll be happy with it at this price."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $82 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. I've been pushing for a higher price, but I've reached the point where I can't get much more from Bob. It's better to secure the $80 from John to ensure I meet my minimum price."
