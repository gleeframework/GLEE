"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a rare and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $825000. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $900000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $900000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive maintenance package and a 5-year warranty. What do you think is a fair price for these extras?",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, but I think the price is still a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'd like to negotiate the value of the extras separately. If you're willing to include them, I'd be willing to pay a premium for them. Can we discuss the value of the extras and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price?",825000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the extras, Bob. I can see you're a savvy negotiator. Let's break down the value of the extras: the maintenance package is worth $20000 and the 5-year warranty is worth $30000. If you're willing to pay the full $825000 for the product, I'll throw in the extras for free. However, if you want to negotiate the value of the extras, I'm willing to consider a price of $860000 for the product and the extras. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I think I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $825000 for the product. I'm willing to accept the extras as a separate deal, so I'll give you $20000 for the maintenance package and $30000 for the 5-year warranty, for a total of $50000. I'll buy the product from you for $825000. Is that a deal?",825000.0,Bob,10,
