Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your proposal, Bob. It shows your commitment to acquiring our product while managing your budget. In consideration of your request, I would like to suggest an alternative that might better suit both our interests. Instead of a traditional payment plan, how about a deferred payment option where you pay $1200000 upfront and the remaining amount is covered by a financing package offered by us, with low-interest rates and flexible repayment terms over 24 months? This way, you can secure the product immediately and spread out the rest of the cost over time. Let me know if this proposal works for you, or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
