In consideration of your request, I would like to suggest an alternative that might better suit both our interests. Instead of a traditional payment plan, how about a deferred payment option where you pay $1,200,000 upfront and the remaining amount is covered by a financing package offered by us, with low-interest rates and flexible repayment terms over 24 months? This way, you can secure the product immediately and spread out the rest of the cost over time.
