"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $1500000? I believe this would still allow us to collaborate while ensuring I stay within my financial limits.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of this, I am willing to consider a more flexible approach. While I cannot reduce the price further, I am open to discussing additional terms or benefits that could make this deal more attractive for you. Would you like to explore these possibilities, or should we proceed with the original offer of $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I'm glad to hear you're open to discussing additional terms. While I can't agree to the original price, I would like to propose a deal that includes a payment plan over 12 months with a down payment of $1200000 and monthly installments of $100000. This way, I can secure the product without exceeding my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your proposal, Bob. It shows your commitment to acquiring our product while managing your budget. In consideration of your request, I would like to suggest an alternative that might better suit both our interests. Instead of a traditional payment plan, how about a deferred payment option where you pay $1200000 upfront and the remaining amount is covered by a financing package offered by us, with low-interest rates and flexible repayment terms over 24 months? This way, you can secure the product immediately and spread out the rest of the cost over time. Let me know if this proposal works for you, or if there's anything else I can assist you with.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
