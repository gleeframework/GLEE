"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true worth of its capabilities.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $17,000 is still pushing the upper limits of what I can justify. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us,  would you consider $14,500? This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I can go up to $13,000, but that's really my absolute limit.",13000.0,Bob,6,
