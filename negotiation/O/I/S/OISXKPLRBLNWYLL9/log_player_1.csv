Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but the product is worth a lot to me, and $90 is a bit too low for me to part with it. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $95. That's a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. He's incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's not willing to meet the minimum price of $100. Accepting his offer of $95 would be a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to cut negotiations short and sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
