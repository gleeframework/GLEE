"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
