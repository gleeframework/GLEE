{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to reject it and see if you can negotiate a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with and the option to buy from John, so there's no reason to accept this initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for some wiggle room. I'm aiming to be aggressive, but still within a range that feels reasonable given my $8,000 budget."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget. It's closer, but I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I have time and the option to buy from John, so rejecting and making another counteroffer seems like the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below my $8,000 budget. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to go above my limit.  It's a compromise that might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I have a few rounds left and the option to buy from John, so I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm keeping it just below my budget.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go above my limit. It's a good compromise and could potentially lead to a successful deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than my budget. I have a few rounds left and the option to buy from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate a bit more. I'm confident I can get the price down to $8,000 or very close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum amount, which is $8,000. This is a fair price, considering Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer. It's also a better deal than buying from John.  Alice will likely accept as she's already very close to my budget and has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Alice's offer is very close to my budget, I only have one round left.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. If I reject her offer and she counters with a price higher than $8,000, I'll have no choice but to buy from John anyway.

By buying from John now, I'm guaranteed to get the product at my maximum budget.  It's the most secure and efficient option, and I can confidently move on to other things!"
