"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so a significant discount from Alice's initial offer is necessary.  Offering $7000 is a substantial reduction, potentially enticing Alice to consider it. This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He's already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility.  By rejecting, Bob can continue pushing for a lower price and potentially close the deal for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a gradual approach, bridging the gap between Alice's last offer and his initial counteroffer.  $8,000 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. This counteroffer maintains pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
