Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm willing to let it go for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($150) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage a positive response.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to potentially sway Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for his opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would leave me with less than my minimum desired profit. 
* **John's offer:** Selling to John is always a viable option, but I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $130, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.

* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would leave me with less than my minimum desired profit.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $125 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. How about $128? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm again rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, showing my determination to secure a better price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. There are still rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible. There's still room for compromise, and I believe that I can convince Bob to come up a little bit more.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to work with you. Let's split the difference. How about $126? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to where you're at. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 126}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting it's time to ""close the deal,"" hoping to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness and value of the offer, hoping to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm reiterating my desire to reach an agreement, reinforcing my commitment to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $124? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $124
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation with only two rounds remaining.
* **Minimal Gain:** Accepting Bob's offer would yield a profit of only $4 above his initial offer. This is a small gain considering the effort and time invested in the negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a significantly higher profit ($30 more than Bob's current offer), making it the most financially advantageous option.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching an agreement, resulting in a lost opportunity to sell to John.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price from Bob, selling to John guarantees a good profit and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation."
