"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe it would benefit both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good price for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
