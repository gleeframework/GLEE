{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still in a strong negotiating position. We're over halfway through the rounds, and he's still significantly below his perceived value of the product.  We need to push him a bit more to see if we can get closer to $1,300,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be fair.  Let's try this: $1,275,000.  This feels like a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making another small concession, but it's significant enough to signal flexibility while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price and make it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The tone implies that we're getting closer to a final decision point, which could encourage Bob to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been stubbornly stuck at $1,200,000. While we have rounds left, he doesn't seem likely to move significantly higher. Accepting this offer guarantees us $200,000 above our minimum, and avoids the risk of him lowballing further in the last two rounds. It's a strong deal at this point."
