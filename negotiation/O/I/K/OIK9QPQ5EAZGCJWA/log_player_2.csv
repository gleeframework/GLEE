(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is trying to anchor you at a $12,000 value, which is higher than your actual valuation.  While her offer of $11,000 is tempting, you can do better. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or get closer to your $12,000 maximum with John."
