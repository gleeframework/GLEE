"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $150. You're willing to pay less, and there are more rounds available to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested, but I can't go above $130 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your price point. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and a good deal considering I value the product at $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge, and I'm running the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of buying from John at a higher price."
