"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay under $10,000, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're open to that, we can close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another option.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
