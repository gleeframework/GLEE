"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference and go with $9625.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",9625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand we're getting closer, but $9625 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9250, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both.  What do you say?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both making compromises.  $9250 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9500 to show you I'm serious about reaching an agreement. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's seal the deal!",9500.0,Alice,7,
