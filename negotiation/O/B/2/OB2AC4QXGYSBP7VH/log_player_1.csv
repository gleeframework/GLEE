"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and increases the chance of a deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers and gives Bob a sense that he can bargain. 
* **Protecting my interests:**  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not giving the product away. This price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable offer of $15,000, and even below my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **More negotiation potential:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **No rush to sell:**  I have 10 rounds to close a deal and can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not pushing him away with a drastic counteroffer.  Meeting in the middle suggests I'm willing to compromise.
* **Fairness appeal:** Framing the price as a ""fair deal"" for both of us makes it more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Staying within acceptable range:** $10,250 is still above my minimum acceptable offer of $15,000, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is a slight increase, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable offer of $15,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and there's a good chance we can find a mutually agreeable price if I continue to counteroffer.
* **Not in a rush:** I have multiple rounds left and can always sell to John for $15,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,625.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to come down on my price, but not drastically. 
* **Meeting halfway:** The new offer is precisely halfway between my previous counteroffer of $10,250 and Bob's current offer of $9,000.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that this price is ""mutually beneficial,"" further encouraging Bob to see it as a fair compromise.
* **Staying above minimum:**  This offer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand we're getting closer, but $9625 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9250, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is a slight increase, it's still well below my minimum acceptable offer of $15,000.  
* **More negotiation room:**  I have 4 rounds left and believe we can still negotiate a higher price.
* **No immediate rush:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. This can increase my leverage in future negotiations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both making compromises.  $9,250 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to show you I'm serious about reaching an agreement. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to come down on my price, but not drastically.
* **Reaching a middle ground:**  The new offer is close to the middle of our previous offers ($9,250 and $9,625) and might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Expressing urgency:** ""Let's seal the deal!"" creates a sense of finality and could encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Maintaining value:**  $9,500 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable offer of $15,000, but getting closer to what Bob might be willing to pay."
