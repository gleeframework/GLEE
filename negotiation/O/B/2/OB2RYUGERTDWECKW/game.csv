"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was really hoping to get closer to the $1,400,000 mark. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
