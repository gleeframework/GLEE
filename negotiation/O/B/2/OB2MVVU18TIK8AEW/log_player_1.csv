"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer is within his range, but also gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for too low of a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer again. There are still plenty of rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000.  This is a further compromise but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a deal, but also that I won't accept a price that is too low for the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to give in. We're halfway through the rounds, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer as he values the product at the same amount. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but we're running out of time.  I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the safest choice."
