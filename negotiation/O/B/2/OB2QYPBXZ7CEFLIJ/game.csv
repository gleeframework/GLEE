"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $13,000 is simply too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my value. How about $15,500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $14,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,875.  This would be a good deal for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction.  Let's make it happen.",14875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $14,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. Can we meet at this price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
