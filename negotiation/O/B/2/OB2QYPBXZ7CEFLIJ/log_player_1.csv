"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his budget constraints, $13,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I receive a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $13,000 is simply too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my value. How about $15,500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a fair price for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $14,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,875.  This would be a good deal for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 14875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $14,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to what I want, it's still not quite there. I've had six rounds of negotiations with Bob, and I'm not sure we'll be able to agree on a price that satisfies both of us. To avoid further delays and ensure I get a reasonable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
