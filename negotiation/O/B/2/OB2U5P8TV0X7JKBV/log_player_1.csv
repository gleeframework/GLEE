"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves some room for negotiation and potential for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to try to get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000. It's also closer to my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell for too much less than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $300 less than my ideal price, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's a good deal considering the time constraint and the risk of not getting any more offers."
