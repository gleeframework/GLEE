Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make this an attractive offer. Would you consider a price of $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a better profit than selling immediately to John.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message hints at the product's value and your minimum acceptable price without revealing it. This creates a sense of urgency and potential for a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate. If he rejects it, you can counter with a slightly lower price, still aiming for above your minimum. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
