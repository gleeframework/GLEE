"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd love. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal, as you'll be getting it for only $10 more than its value. If you're not interested, no worries, I have another buyer lined up. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
