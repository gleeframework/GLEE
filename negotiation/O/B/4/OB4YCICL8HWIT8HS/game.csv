"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can derive from it. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've done my research and I believe the product is worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at this price, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
