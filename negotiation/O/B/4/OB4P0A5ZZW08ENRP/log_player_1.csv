Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000 if Bob declines.
* **Bob's Perspective:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He gains value only if he can buy it for less than that.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,000,001 (Bob's maximum) and $1,499,999 (the highest you could go before John's offer is better).

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. It's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to frame the product positively.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value and below your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""fair price"" and ""market worth"" provides a basis for your asking price, even if it's subjective.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you could consider a slightly more moderate opening price. 

**Remember, this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response.**"
