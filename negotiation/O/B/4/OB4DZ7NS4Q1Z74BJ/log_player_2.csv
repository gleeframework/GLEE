"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is under your $100 budget, you know John will sell it to you for $100.  It's worth seeing if Alice might lower her price, getting you a better deal."
