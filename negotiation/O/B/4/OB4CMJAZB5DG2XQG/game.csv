"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between our current offers.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
