"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8000}
