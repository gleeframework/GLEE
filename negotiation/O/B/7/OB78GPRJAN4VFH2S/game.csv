"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",8000.0,Alice,3,
