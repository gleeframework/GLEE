Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,000. I believe it provides significant value, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $9,800? I think that's a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

``` 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $9,800 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away if I push too hard.
