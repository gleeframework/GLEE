Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice even closer to her ideal outcome.
* **Avoid a Counter-Offer:** By starting with a strong, yet reasonable price, Alice reduces the chance of Bob countering with an offer too low (closer to John's $10,000).

**Important Note:** While Alice has a guaranteed sale with John, maximizing her profit means trying to secure the best deal with Bob first."
