,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $120.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we try $152? It's a slight compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to consider my proposal, but $152 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $140, so I'll try $145. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. How about we try $148? It's a slight compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",148.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to consider my proposal again, but $148 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $145, so I'll try $147. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",147.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $147. How about we try $149? It's a small compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",149.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit tired of this back-and-forth, Alice. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll pay $140, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",140.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $140. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer: $146. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John for $150.",146.0,Alice,11,
