"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your ideal price and your fallback option (buying from John). There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer but clearly states that it's beyond your budget.
* **Justification:** Suggesting the offer is ""fair"" provides a small justification without revealing your true willingness to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your backup price, but there's still some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a slightly better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $7,000? That would work well for me."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments to show willingness to compromise, but not too quickly.
* **Reiterating Budget Constraints:**  Re-emphasizing the ""stretch"" helps solidify your position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Direct Proposal:** Offering a specific number keeps the negotiation moving and encourages a counter-proposal from Alice."
