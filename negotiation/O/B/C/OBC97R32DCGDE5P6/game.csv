"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
