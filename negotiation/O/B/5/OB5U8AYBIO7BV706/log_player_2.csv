"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is better for Bob than buying from John for $12,000.  Even though Bob values the product at $12,000, getting it for $9,500 saves him $2,500."
