Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being optimistic and stating my confidence in the product's value to Bob. This helps set the tone for the negotiation and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's too early in the negotiation to accept such a low offer. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $150, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 threshold.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, as I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet halfway at $140. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 140}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I still feel I can push for a better deal.  I'm confident in the value of the product, and I want to make sure I get as close to my desired price as possible.  I'll reject his offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close.  $135 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit off. Let's compromise at $138. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement without further negotiation. "", ""product_price"": 138}
```"

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk losing out on a better price, so I'll sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures I achieve my minimum goal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
