"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product's value subtly implies it's worth more than the asking price. 

**Strategy:** I'll observe Bob's response to this initial offer and adjust my strategy for the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $175 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like to sell for.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **Strategy:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $190 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 190}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and positive tone helps keep the negotiations constructive.
* **Value Emphasis:** I again remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. If Bob still rejects, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my budget, how about $180 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob's offer of $180 is very close to my minimum desired price of $150.  With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a higher price. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The negotiation is progressing, but I don't want to risk Bob losing interest or finding another seller. 
* **Profit Margin:**  $180 is a good profit margin, and accepting this offer allows me to move on to other opportunities.

**Strategy:**  I'm choosing to close the deal at this point to secure a reasonable profit and avoid potential losses from further negotiation."
