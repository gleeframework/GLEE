"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects a fair compromise and allows you to still realize substantial value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction.",800000.0,Alice,5,
