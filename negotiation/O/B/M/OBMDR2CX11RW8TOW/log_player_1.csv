"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's start the negotiation! "", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still secure a good profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my desired profit. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with a price that's closer to my desired profit while still showing flexibility. I'm also emphasizing a ""fair"" price to make it easier for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm again offering a slightly lower price but still maintaining a good profit margin. I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept.  I'm also emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome to create a more positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $795,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $805,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

I'm now offering a price that's very close to my minimum, emphasizing that it's my final offer. This puts the pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the opportunity.  I'm also reminding him that I have other options available to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $805,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $795,000, and I'm willing to throw in an additional $5,000 for some extra services related to the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not comfortable going any lower than my minimum price of $800,000. Bob is offering $795,000, which is still below my minimum. While he's offering additional services, they're not valuable enough to me to compensate for the price difference.  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $800,000."
