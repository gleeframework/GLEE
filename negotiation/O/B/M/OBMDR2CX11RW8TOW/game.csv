"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial. Let's make a deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
