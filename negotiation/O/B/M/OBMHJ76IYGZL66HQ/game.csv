"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $17,000.  What do you say?",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $17,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $18,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $17,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",17500.0,Bob,4,
