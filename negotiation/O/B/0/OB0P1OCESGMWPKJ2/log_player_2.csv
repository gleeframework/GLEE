# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room:** I don't want to go too low and offend Alice, as I still have a good amount of room before hitting John's $10,000 price.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message aims to maintain a positive tone and show I'm serious about the purchase, just not at the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down significantly, she's still quite far from her perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to $7,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm aiming for a price that splits the difference between her current offer ($7,500) and my previous one ($6,500). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and proposes a specific number, making it clear what I'm looking for.
* **Still Below John:** I'm maintaining a price point where I'm saving significantly compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $7,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain:**  Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and the difference between her current offer ($7,250) and my target price ($7,000) is relatively small.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, and there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal.
* **Significant Savings:**  Even at $7,250, I'm still saving a substantial amount compared to John's offer of $10,000."
