"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, my absolute maximum is closer to $900,000.  If you can't do that, I might have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $900,000 is too low for me to consider. My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a significant discount and I believe a fair price. Let me know if you're willing to move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
