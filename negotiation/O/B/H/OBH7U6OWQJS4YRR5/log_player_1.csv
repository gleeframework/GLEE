Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This still gives you a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
