Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let the product go for $125. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your flexibility. Would it be possible to lower the price to $120? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd still prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to close the deal now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
