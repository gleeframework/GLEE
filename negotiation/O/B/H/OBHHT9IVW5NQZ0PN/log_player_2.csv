"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $15,000. This is a bad deal for Bob, who is willing to pay $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Bob is willing to pay the maximum of $10,000. This is his best offer.  Alice can either accept this offer or reject it and make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can secure the product from John for his maximum price, so there's no point in further negotiation."
