Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $100 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Both you and Bob can potentially increase or decrease the price in the future, allowing for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While selling to John for $100 would be a safe option, rejecting Bob's offer allows for a chance to potentially get closer to your desired price. 

Even though Bob is offering your minimum, you have the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your initial offer. This keeps the negotiation going and may lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $100. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still being above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is just $5 less than my initial counteroffer and is only $5 less than my minimum selling price.  It is worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
