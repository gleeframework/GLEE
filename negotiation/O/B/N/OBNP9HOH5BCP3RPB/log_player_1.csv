"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal, and allows me to potentially increase the final price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,750. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $13,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More negotiation is possible:**  We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I can still sell to John for a higher price if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we try $14,250?  It's a fair compromise that's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a slight concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of this compromise, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but no higher. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Time and Risk:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a satisfactory price from Bob is increasing.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired price. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might not lead to a higher price.  I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and I'll receive my minimum acceptable price."
