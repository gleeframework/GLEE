While I'm getting close to my floor price of $80,  I'll reject this offer. I still believe I can get a slightly higher price from Bob. I'll make one more counteroffer in the next round.  If he rejects that, I'll move on to John to avoid risking getting nothing."

Bob has offered my floor price, but I'm worried that if I counteroffer, I risk him walking away completely.  There's only one round left and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'll sell to John to ensure I at least get my minimum price."
