"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price closer to Alice's minimum value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to split the difference between Alice's offer and his maximum value. This shows good faith and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's fair. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice not budging further outweighs the potential savings."
