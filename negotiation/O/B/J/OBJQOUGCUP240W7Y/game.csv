"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe this product will be worth the investment for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to offer $10,500 again, and I hope you can meet me there. Can you reconsider?",10500.0,Bob,6,
