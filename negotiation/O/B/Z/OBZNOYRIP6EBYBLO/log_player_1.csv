Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's close to Bob's value:**  $14,000 is closer to Bob's valuation of $15,000, increasing the likelihood that he'll accept the offer. 
* **It sets a strong starting point:**  By starting high, I can potentially negotiate down to a price closer to my desired amount if Bob counteroffers.

I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary. If he rejects the offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and make a decision based on my desired outcome and his willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good offer, it's still below my ideal price. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price. Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate, so I'll counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows that I am willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.  

I believe this offer is still attractive to Bob as he values the product at $15,000. By meeting him halfway, I hope to secure a deal that is closer to my desired outcome while still being a fair price for both parties."
