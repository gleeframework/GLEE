"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $14,000 from Alice. You have a good chance of negotiating a lower price since Alice values the product at $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. It also leaves room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice just rejected your counteroffer. It's best to accept the offer and avoid risking further negotiation."
