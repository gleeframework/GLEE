"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $13,500 is too low for me, even though I'm nearing the midway point of negotiations. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $14,000. It's a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground before we start getting too close to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I've got a few rounds left, and I don't want to sell to John for $10,000 if I can avoid it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,500 is getting close to John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I only have two rounds left, so I need to start closing the deal soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer.  We're down to our last round, and I need to secure a deal."

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum.  I've tried hard to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not comfortable going lower.  I'll accept John's offer of $10,000 to ensure I don't lose money on this deal."
