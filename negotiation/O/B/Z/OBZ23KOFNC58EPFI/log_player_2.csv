"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
