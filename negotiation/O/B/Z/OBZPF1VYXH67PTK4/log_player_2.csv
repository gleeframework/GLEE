"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that holds significant value for your business. My asking price is $1,000,000, a price that reflects the product's worth and provides you with a substantial return on your investment. This is a unique opportunity to gain a competitive edge, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable addition to your operations.  I understand this is a significant decision, so please take your time to consider.  If you decline, I will be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** While it's not the absolute lowest you could get, it's still a $200,000 saving compared to buying from John.
* **Your goal is to save money, not get the absolute lowest price.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so anything less is a win."
