"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
