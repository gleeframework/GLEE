"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to pay $10,750.   What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  How about $10,900?  It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10900.0,Alice,5,
