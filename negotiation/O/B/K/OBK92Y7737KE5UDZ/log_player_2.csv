"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to pay $10,750.   What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  How about $10,900?  It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** $10,900 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, and this offer is closer to Bob's desired price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a possibility of getting a slightly lower price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.

At this point, accepting the offer is the most prudent decision for Bob, as it secures a good deal within his budget and avoids potential risk."
