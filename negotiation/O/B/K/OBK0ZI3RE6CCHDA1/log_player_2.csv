Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I was hoping we could get closer to the original offer I made. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1300000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1225000. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than her original offer and higher than Bob's last counteroffer. This price is within Bob's budget and allows him to save a significant amount compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best course of action."
