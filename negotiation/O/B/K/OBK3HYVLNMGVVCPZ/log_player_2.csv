"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you know you can potentially get the product for a better price from Alice. By rejecting this offer, you encourage Alice to potentially propose a lower price closer to her $80 value."
