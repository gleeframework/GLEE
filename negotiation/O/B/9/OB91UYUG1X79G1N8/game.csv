"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $1,000,000. This product is worth a lot more, and I believe $1,000,000 is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
