"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $9,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $10,000 to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $11,500. This is a fair compromise that's still within my range.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
