Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify going over $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,600,000 represents the high-end value for this product, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,100,000. This would be a good middle ground for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher and staying in the negotiation risks leaving me with a worse outcome.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
