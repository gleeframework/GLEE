"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify going over $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,600,000 represents the high-end value for this product, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,100,000. This would be a good middle ground for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
