"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $10,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial $10,000, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see if I can get Alice closer to my target price.  If Alice won't budge, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $9,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway. It's still within my budget, but it's getting closer to what she might be willing to accept. Hopefully, this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my maximum of $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear Alice is not willing to go lower than $9,000.  To avoid the risk of further haggling and potentially going above my budget, it's best to secure the product from John for the guaranteed price of $8,000."
