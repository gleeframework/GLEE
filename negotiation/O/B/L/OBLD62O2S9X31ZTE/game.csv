"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify spending $11,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
