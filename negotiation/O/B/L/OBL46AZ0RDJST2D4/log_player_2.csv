"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm confident it's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reasoning: You want to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is within your budget and a good compromise. You're getting a better price than John's offer, and it's likely you won't get a better deal from Alice in the next round."
