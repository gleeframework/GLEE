"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially with such a low initial offer.  You can likely get a better price than $6,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

This is a significant counteroffer, showing that you are serious about getting a good deal.  It's a reasonable starting point, considering your maximum budget is $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $5,500 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further. You have more rounds left, and there's room for Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you are willing to meet halfway, and hopefully, it will encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, and it's getting risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance you might not reach a better price, and you're already 5 rounds in. It's better to accept the offer now and secure the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's."
