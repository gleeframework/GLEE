"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $3,000, which is a significant benefit. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and you risk Alice rejecting your counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on unnecessarily."
