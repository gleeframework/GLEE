"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,500 is fair.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $13,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  It's a fair offer that's within our both of our interests.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it. How about $11,800? This could be a great deal for both of us.",11800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but $11,800 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $11,650. This shows a genuine effort to meet you halfway and finalize this deal.",11650.0,Bob,6,
