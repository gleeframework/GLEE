Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is already at his maximum valuation of the product. There's no room for negotiation to get a higher price from him. Accepting his offer would meet my minimum, but selling to John achieves the same outcome without wasting further time."
