,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $22000?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I want to make sure we can come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $20250. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value",20250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $20000, which is as close to $19750 as I can get without losing money. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price",20000.0,Alice,9,
