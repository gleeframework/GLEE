{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong opening price.  While it's above Bob's perceived value, it's still below the value to you, giving him room to negotiate and leaving some wiggle room for you. This approach balances maximizing profit with maintaining the potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or, if necessary, sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is too low for me.  The product is worth more to both of us than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
