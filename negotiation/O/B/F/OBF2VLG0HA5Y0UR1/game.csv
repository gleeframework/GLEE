"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
