"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,062,500.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution at this price.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,062,500. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000 was my previous offer, but I can see that you're still not comfortable with that. Let me try to find a sweet spot in the middle. I'll counter with a price of $1,090,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,090,000 is still not in my budget.  Let's aim for a compromise at $1,080,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that benefits both of us and brings us closer to a final deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,080,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,095,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
