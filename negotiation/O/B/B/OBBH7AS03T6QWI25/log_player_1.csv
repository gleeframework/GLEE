Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm setting a price significantly higher than my minimum threshold. This allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, but I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still leaving room for potential profit.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob while still being within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum threshold. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better price, and it risks losing time. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired amount, making it the most efficient choice in this situation."
