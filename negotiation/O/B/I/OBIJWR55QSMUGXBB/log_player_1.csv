"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. This also shows that I believe in the value of the product and am not simply trying to get rid of it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll need to counter with a price closer to my minimum but still try to leave room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $6,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on the value of the product. The message emphasizes the value to further encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counter again, keeping in mind the importance of closing the deal but still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your offer.  $7,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $7,750?  It's a fair price, considering the value we both know it holds. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

I'm trying to meet in the middle again, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stick to my budget.  Could you do $7,400?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,400 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not completely satisfied. This deal feels a bit too close to my minimum. I have some rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter again, but I'll also need to consider the option of selling to John, especially if the next few rounds don't result in a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I can't go lower than $7,500, but at that price, we can both walk away happy. This is my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm coming down to a price that's very close to my minimum, but still slightly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to put pressure on Bob and encourage him to accept.  At this point, I'm also considering the option of selling to John if Bob rejects this offer."
