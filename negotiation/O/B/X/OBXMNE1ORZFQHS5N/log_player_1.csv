Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love!  I'm asking $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately lose a potential deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves a buffer for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a bit more.  There's a good chance he'll be willing to compromise further.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price with Bob.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll likely counter with something slightly higher than his offer to push for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the ""good price for both of us"" aspect to emphasize the fairness of the deal and potentially sway Bob toward accepting.
* **Positive Framing:** I reiterate my confidence in the product to reinforce its desirability and encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13500. I'd be willing to meet you at $13000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is at the very edge of my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation is likely to be unproductive and time-consuming. 
* **Secure the deal:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, this deal is almost as good and secures the sale quickly. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate might result in Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with no sale at all."
