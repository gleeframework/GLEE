"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I know it would be valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $110 is less than what John is selling for, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob wants to start the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a bargaining range and demonstrates his desire to save money.
* **Reasoning:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, making it more persuasive. He emphasizes that this price is fair for both of them.
* **Room for Compromise:** $95 still leaves room for Alice to counter with a higher price, allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $102? It's a great deal for a product you'll get a lot of value from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Value for Money:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the price is now within his budget and close to his target. 
* **Time is Money:**  Bob has already rejected one offer and could potentially lose out on the product if he continues to negotiate, especially with the option to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
