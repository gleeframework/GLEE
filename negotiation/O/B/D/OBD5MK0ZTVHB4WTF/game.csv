"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $925000? This still allows us to maintain a good profit margin while making the product more accessible to you. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to pay $910000, but I need to stay within that budget. Let's work together to find a common ground.",910000.0,Bob,4,
