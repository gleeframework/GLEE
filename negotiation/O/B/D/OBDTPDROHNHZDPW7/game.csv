"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above $8500.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a significant discount from my original offer.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to go with $9000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
