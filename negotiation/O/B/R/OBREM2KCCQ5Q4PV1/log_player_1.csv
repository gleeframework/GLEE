Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Alternative buyer:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose out.
* **""Value"" emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""value"" of the product aims to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrasing ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the conversation flowing. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: 
* **Best-case scenario:** Bob accepts the initial offer or a negotiated price closer to it, yielding a profit beyond $10,000.
* **Worst-case scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and I still sell it to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
