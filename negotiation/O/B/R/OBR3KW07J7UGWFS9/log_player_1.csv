``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and also highlights that I'm serious about selling to Bob.  I'm hopeful he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from it. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000, given the value you've indicated this product holds for you. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. I think that's a sweet spot for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my desired price and is a good compromise. I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  Accepting this offer will bring me closer to my goal of maximizing profits while also avoiding the risk of selling to John at a lower price."
