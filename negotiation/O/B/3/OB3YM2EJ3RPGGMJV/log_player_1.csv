{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $110 as the initial offer, which is a good compromise between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This strategy allows for negotiation and potential for a deal.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my target.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $98. I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too far away from my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made multiple concessions, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $120 from John."
