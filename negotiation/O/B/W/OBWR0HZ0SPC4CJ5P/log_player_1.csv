"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $10,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,875.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and we're running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. It's a better deal than what Bob is offering, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
