"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price down further, potentially to a point where it's more appealing than John's offer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped for. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still leaving you with a substantial profit."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that balances my minimum requirement with your willingness to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not within Bob's ideal range.  There's still a gap between Bob's counteroffer and Alice's current offer. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product while still providing you with a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that balances your budget with the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. It's a fair price considering Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John would be significantly more expensive. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
