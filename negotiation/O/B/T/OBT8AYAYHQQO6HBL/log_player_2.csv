You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is substantial, it's still significantly higher than your walk-away price ($1,500,000 from John).  By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a better deal. It opens the door for a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your desired price range."
