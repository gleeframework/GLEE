Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to start high. This maximizes potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, allowing Bob to counter-offer and start a negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, cautious), you might adjust your approach.
* **Market Information:**  While you know Bob's valuation, if you had information about comparable products in the market, you could strengthen your position. 

This offer aims high, but be prepared to negotiate!"
