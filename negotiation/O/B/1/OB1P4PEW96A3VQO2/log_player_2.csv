Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $8,500, which is still a good compromise for both of us. It's a price that reflects the value the product will bring to you, and it's closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed deal rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
