"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $7,000. That's a fair offer considering it's over half your initial asking price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $8,500, which is still a good compromise for both of us. It's a price that reflects the value the product will bring to you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
