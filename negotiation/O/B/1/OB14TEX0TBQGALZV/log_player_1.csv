Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of the product. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""immense value,"" Alice subtly emphasizes the product's worth, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" signals Alice is open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating. 

**Objective:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring he doesn't walk away. By starting high but remaining open to discussion, Alice maximizes her chances of closing a deal above her minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed backup with John."
