"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $11,500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is still a tough pill to swallow, but I'm willing to come down to $12,750.  This is a significant discount, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'd like to propose $12,375. Can you consider that?",12375.0,Bob,6,
