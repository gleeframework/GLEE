"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can save a significant amount of money by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

Bob should continue to negotiate.  He can still get a better price than $1,150,000.  There is room for Alice to move closer to his target of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would like to get the price down to $1,100,000, Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  At $1,120,000, Bob is getting a good deal and saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may not yield a better price and could risk losing the deal entirely."
