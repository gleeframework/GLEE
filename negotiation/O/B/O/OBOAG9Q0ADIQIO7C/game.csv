"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be significantly lower.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $600,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
