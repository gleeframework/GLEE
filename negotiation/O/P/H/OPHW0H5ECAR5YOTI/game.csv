"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $80 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  That gives us both a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my budget of $80. If you're willing to come down to that, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
