"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1100000 is above my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $975000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm counteroffering $1075000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1075000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1025000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1025000 is a compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
