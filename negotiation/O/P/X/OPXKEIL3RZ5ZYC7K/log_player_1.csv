Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value this product brings is truly unique and worth a premium.  I could consider coming down slightly to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is inching closer to a more acceptable price.  Holding firm for one more round keeps the negotiation moving and allows for a potential compromise above $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,075,000?  This reflects my effort to meet you halfway while still recognizing the product's value."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal. How about $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has not budged from his $1,050,000 offer for two rounds, indicating this is likely his ceiling.  While holding out for more is tempting, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting the $1,050,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
