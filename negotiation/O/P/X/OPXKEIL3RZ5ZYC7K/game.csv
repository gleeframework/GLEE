"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal. How about $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
