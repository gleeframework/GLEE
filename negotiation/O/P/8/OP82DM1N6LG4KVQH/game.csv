"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return you'll see.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is considerably below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see this transaction benefit us both.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's the most I can reasonably afford at this time.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
