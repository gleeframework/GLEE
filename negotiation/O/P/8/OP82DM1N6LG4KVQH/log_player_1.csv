"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum and still leaves a lot of room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is considerably below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see this transaction benefit us both."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's the most I can reasonably afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to my minimum, I believe I can still nudge Bob a bit higher. I'll reject his offer to signal I'm looking for a slightly better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
