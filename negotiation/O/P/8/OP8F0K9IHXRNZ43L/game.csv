Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What are your thoughts?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1050000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount.  How about $975000?  That seems like a fair price that benefits us both.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering $1050000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $1025000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
