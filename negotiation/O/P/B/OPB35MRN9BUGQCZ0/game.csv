"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident this product is worth that to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $12000 is tempting. However, I'm still holding out for a little more.  How about we split the difference and I accept $13500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you accept.",12000.0,Bob,4,
