"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is way too high, but it is good that she is willing to negotiate. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to my budget."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise.
