"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can do.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
