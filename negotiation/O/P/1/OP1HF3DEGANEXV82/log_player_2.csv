"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $130.  While this is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $120. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $150 and Alice is now offering it for $120. This is still a good deal for Bob and a better price than John's offer. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this scenario."
