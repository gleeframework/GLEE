"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It's time to cut negotiations with Alice. She's consistently staying above your maximum budget, and while she might come down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her staying above $1,000,000. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs."
