"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
