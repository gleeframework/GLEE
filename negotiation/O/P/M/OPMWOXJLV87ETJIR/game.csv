,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move the product quickly.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $9,000?  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and this price would be fair for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go any lower than $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move the product quickly.  Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price for both of us. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Can you consider selling the product to me for $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,8,
