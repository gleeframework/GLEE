"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the opportunity to earn a good profit while hopefully securing a deal with Bob.  If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in the following rounds, but I'm also keeping John's $12,000 offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  We have nine rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move the product quickly."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my goal.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue to push for a higher price. We have six rounds left, so there's still time to get closer to my desired price point.  I also need to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000, but I'm hoping to secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $9,000?  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is a good offer, it's still quite far from my minimum value of $12,000. I'm determined to get a better price. We have four rounds left, and there's still time to negotiate. I'll continue to push for a higher price, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go any lower than $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move the product quickly.  Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price for both of us. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Can you consider selling the product to me for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob is not willing to come up to my desired price.  He seems to be adamant about his $8,500 offer, which is too low for me.  Therefore, I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John to secure a profit. It's better to have a guaranteed deal than to risk losing both potential buyers by continuing to negotiate."
