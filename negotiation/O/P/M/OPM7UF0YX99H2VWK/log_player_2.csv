"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's initial offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and it allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer already reflects a significant discount on its true worth to you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal. There are still several rounds remaining, so Bob has time to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle and settle at $1,087,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,106,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,106,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,106,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above Bob's target price. There are still a few rounds left, so Bob can continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his ideal $1,050,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and keep pushing for a more favorable deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm happy to go a little higher, but $1,106,250 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,091,875.  That's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 1091875}
