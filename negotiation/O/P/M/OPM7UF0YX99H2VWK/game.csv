"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and it allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer already reflects a significant discount on its true worth to you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle and settle at $1,087,500.  What do you say?",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,106,250.",1106250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm happy to go a little higher, but $1,106,250 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,091,875.  That's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.",1091875.0,Bob,6,
