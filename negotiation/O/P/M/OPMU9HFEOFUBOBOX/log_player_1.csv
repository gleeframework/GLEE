Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer sets a high bar, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counter, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still far below the value I know the product holds for him. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for his first counter. This keeps the pressure on Bob while demonstrating my willingness to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's getting closer to my desired price.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price, or even a rejection that would force me to sell to John at a much lower price. This offer provides a significant profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
