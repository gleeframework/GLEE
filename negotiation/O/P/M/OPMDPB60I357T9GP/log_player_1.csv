Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a price significantly above my minimum ($100). 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. This gives me leverage in the negotiation, as I don't have to accept an offer below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum selling price, it's closer to my bottom line than Bob's perceived value of the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation to secure a better deal. I'll counter-offer and see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $110, I'm aiming for a classic negotiation tactic â€“ finding a compromise that feels fair to both sides. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, showing Bob that I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Open for Further Negotiation:**  The tone remains open to continued discussion, in case Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $100. How about $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:** While not ideal, $107 is still a reasonable profit above my minimum selling price of $100. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether. He's consistently moving towards $100, and I risk pushing him too far. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and allows me to move on to other potential sales."
