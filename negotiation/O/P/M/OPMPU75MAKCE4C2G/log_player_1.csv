This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than what Bob is willing to pay but significantly lower than my minimum desired price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and while he's getting closer to my desired price, he's still unwilling to meet my minimum.  At this point, it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further time spent in potentially fruitless negotiations."
