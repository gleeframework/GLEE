Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Testing the Waters:** The $19,000 offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects it outright, you haven't lost anything and can always fall back on John.
* **Justification:**  The message includes a brief justification for the price, emphasizing the product's value. While it's unlikely to convince Bob to pay more than he thinks it's worth, it presents a confident starting point."
