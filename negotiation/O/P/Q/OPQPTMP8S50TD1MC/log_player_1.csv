Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you or earning you significant sums in the long run. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair price."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to aim high with Bob. This creates the possibility of a significant profit.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing on a price significantly higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:**  While this is a starting point, observing Bob's reaction and being prepared to adjust my offer slightly might be necessary to secure the deal."
