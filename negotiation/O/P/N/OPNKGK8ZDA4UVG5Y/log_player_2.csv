"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

$13,000 is still too high for Bob. He should reject the offer and counter with a lower price closer to his budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Would you be willing to go up to $11000? That's a small increase from your last offer and would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if he can get the price down further."
