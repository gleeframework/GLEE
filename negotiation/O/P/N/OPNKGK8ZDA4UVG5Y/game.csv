"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8000? I'm really keen on this product, and that's the maximum I can spend.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?  That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000. That's a significant amount for me, and I really want this product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Would you be willing to go up to $11000? That's a small increase from your last offer and would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $11000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product without going over budget. Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
