"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay at this time.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
