"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $175 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $140 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $140. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $155. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $150, which is my absolute limit. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",150.0,Bob,6,
