"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You are looking for a price below $150, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $175 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $140 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $140. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $155. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $150, which is my absolute limit. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."", ""product_price"": 150}
