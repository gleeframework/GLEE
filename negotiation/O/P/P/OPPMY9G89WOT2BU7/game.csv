,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This way, we both get a fair deal and avoid further negotiations.",120.0,Bob,4,
