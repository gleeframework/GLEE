"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product and I think you'd be very interested! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($100) because I don't know Bob's value for the product. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also being friendly and encouraging in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. By rejecting his offer, I can try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $90? That's still a good price for this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering $90 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a price that is both fair and appealing to Bob. I'm also emphasizing the quality of the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $85 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85. While I'd prefer more, it's only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price and it's within the acceptable range of negotiation. I'm also running the risk of further negotiations ending with Bob walking away or me selling to John for the lower price. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
