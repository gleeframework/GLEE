"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't feel pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my target price and even my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's serious but also trying to anchor the negotiation lower. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product offers is truly unique and rare. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects its inherent worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession ($250,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Holding Ground:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, aiming for a higher final sale.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to emphasize the product's unique value to justify the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving in the right direction, but very slowly. It's clear he's trying to see how low he can get me to go.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'll make a smaller concession this round to show I'm getting to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate our negotiations so far. However, $1,750,000 is below what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $1,900,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and indicating I'm willing to walk away from the deal.
* **Smaller Concession:** The smaller concession ($100,000) further reinforces the idea that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Maintaining Above Minimum:** While firm, the offer is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, providing a small buffer for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:** Bob has countered with his ""final offer,"" and it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Limited Potential for Agreement:** There's little indication he'll come up substantially, especially with both of us declaring ""final offers.""
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price of $1,500,000, while continuing with Bob carries a risk of getting even less or reaching no agreement at all.

It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed deal with John."
