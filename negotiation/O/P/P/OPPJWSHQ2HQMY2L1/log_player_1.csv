"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $950,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I'm hoping for, $1,025,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,040,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both achieve our goals. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,040,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but that's the maximum I can offer. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very tight.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm concerned that further rounds may not lead to a deal that meets my minimum price. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to continue. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000."
