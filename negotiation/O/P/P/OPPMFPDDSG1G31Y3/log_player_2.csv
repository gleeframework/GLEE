"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $120, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $127.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $115? That's a good price for both of us and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $123? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still looking to spend less than $123, and you have a safety net with John's offer at $150. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can push Alice closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $123 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $119.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 119}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. I think this is the best price I can offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $125, which is more than you're willing to pay.  It's better to buy the product from John for $150, as it's still within your budget."
