"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",12500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12500. How about we meet in the middle at $12250? That's a good compromise for me.,12250.0,Bob,4,
