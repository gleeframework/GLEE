"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $80? I think that's a fair offer.",80.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but $80 is too low for me. I'm counteroffering at $120. Let me see if we can meet in the middle from there.",120.0,Alice,5,,
