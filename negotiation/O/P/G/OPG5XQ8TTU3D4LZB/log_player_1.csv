Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $100. While I could sell to John for $100, I'd prefer to try and get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120.  I'll counter with a price closer to mine."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
