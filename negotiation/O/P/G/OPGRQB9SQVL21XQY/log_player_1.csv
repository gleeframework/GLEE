{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with incredible potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit above your minimum threshold.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'd like, it's still above my minimum threshold.  I'm going to reject his offer, hoping to get a better price.  I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in subsequent rounds."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly what I would get from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as he's unlikely to go higher. I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
