"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I can't meet your initial asking price. I propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is tempting, it's a bit too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This would still be a very good deal for you, and a fair compromise for me.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
