{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $75 is a substantial drop from her initial price, and it's a price I'm comfortable paying.  I'm hoping to see if she'll meet me halfway or make a counter-counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my target price, it's still worth seeing if I can get Alice to come down further.  I'm hoping to close the deal for $80 or less, so I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $80, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still looking for a good deal. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if she doesn't."
