"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a significant offer,  I believe the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,225,000 for the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
