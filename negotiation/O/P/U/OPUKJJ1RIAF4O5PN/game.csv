,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $80?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
