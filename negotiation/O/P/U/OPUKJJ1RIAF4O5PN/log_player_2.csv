"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save money, it's always best to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than Alice's original $100 offer, it's still higher than my personal limit of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $80?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
