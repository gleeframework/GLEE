Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Opening:** I'm being friendly and expressing confidence in the product's appeal to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussion and potentially adjusting the price. 

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His reaction will give me an idea of whether he's willing to pay a higher price.
* **Set a High Anchor:**  Starting high can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** If Bob counteroffers, I have room to negotiate without dropping below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By showing I'm not desperate to sell, I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer:** I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price. 
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well, I have the option to sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Justify the Price:** I provide a reason for the price (fair profit) to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer:

* **Tests the Waters:** It gauges whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Keeps Option Open:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $80 or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $80?  That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer allows me to:

* **Meet my Minimum:** I get the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:**  There's no need to go through more rounds of counteroffers.
* **Sell Quickly:**  I can finalize the sale and move on.

While I could potentially try to get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting and needing to sell to John for the same price makes accepting his offer the most logical choice."
