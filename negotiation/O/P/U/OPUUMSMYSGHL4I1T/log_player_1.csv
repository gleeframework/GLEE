Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you mention John, you don't want to explicitly use him as leverage.  This keeps the tone collaborative rather than threatening.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counter-offers.  You can always go down, but you can't go up!"
