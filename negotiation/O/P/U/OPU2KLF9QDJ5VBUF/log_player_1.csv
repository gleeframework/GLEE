Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is getting closer, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob's offer of $770,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my asking price, so it's a better deal for me right now."
