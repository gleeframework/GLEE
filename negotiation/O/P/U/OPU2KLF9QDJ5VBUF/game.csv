"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $850,000. It's a steal for something worth so much to you, and I'm confident it will be a game changer for your business. Let's talk!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000 to make this happen. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit far off from that number. How about $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  $750,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $780,000?  This would allow me to make this sale, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit and offer $770,000. I believe that's a very fair offer considering the current market and the value I see in this product.",770000.0,Bob,6,
