Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get the highest price possible. Starting high leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding John's $10,000 offer.
* **Gauge Interest:** The high price allows Alice to assess Bob's eagerness. If he accepts immediately, she knows she could have potentially gone even higher.
* **Alternative Secured:** Alice has a safety net with John's offer. If Bob rejects the initial price, she can negotiate down knowing she won't be losing money. 

**Important Note:**  While the initial offer is high, Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob. She can gradually lower the price, aiming for a sweet spot above $10,000 where Bob is likely to accept while still maximizing her profit."
