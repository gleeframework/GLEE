Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value increases the likelihood of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm prepared to offer it at $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his perceived value. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions your offer as carefully considered, making it seem more appealing.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You might have to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your minimum of $1,200,000 in mind."
