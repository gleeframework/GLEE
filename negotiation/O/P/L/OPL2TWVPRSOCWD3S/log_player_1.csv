Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  This means starting above his actual value.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential""  helps justify the high price.
* **""Fair Price"" Framing:**  By stating you believe it's a fair price, you anchor the negotiation around a higher number.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $1,450,000 â€“ excellent!
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer. You have room to go down slightly, but never below $1,500,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
