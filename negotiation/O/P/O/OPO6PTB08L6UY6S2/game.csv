"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,500 is significantly below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $12,200? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,200 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $12,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12250.0,Bob,6,
