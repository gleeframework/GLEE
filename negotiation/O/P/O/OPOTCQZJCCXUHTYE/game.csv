"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is great, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand that it's a significant amount, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $11,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
