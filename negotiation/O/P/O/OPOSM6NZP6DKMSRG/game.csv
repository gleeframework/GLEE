"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows for a fair deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
