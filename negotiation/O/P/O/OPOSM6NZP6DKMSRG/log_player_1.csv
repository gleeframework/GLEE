"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value and the possibility of a deal, I aim to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** The message explicitly mentions finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches his perceived value, which is significantly below my minimum. Accepting now would mean a $300,000 loss compared to selling to John. I have room to negotiate and will aim for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** My counteroffer drops by $200,000, signaling flexibility while remaining significantly above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Justification of Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's worth to justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair deal,"" suggesting I'm open to further negotiation, but not at a significant loss.

I'm aiming to understand Bob's willingness to move from his initial offer. If he doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I'll strongly consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  There's no further room for negotiation without potentially losing money. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome in this situation."
