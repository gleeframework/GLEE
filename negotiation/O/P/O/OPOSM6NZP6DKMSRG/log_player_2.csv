{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows for a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
