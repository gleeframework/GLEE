"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,150,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,200,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do. If you're still interested, let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,8,
