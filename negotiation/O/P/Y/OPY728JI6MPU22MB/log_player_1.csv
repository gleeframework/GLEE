Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but I'm still hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $110?  It's still a good price for you, and a fair one for me."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, and I'm not sure we'll be able to get close enough on price. It's better to just sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
