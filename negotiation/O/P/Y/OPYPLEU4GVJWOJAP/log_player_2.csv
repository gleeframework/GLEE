"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  $110 is significantly less than $150.
* **Alice is unlikely to go lower.**  She's already met Bob halfway, and Bob's initial counteroffer was close to her minimum.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much better price. 
* **The product is worth $150 to Bob.** Even at $110, Bob is getting a good deal and getting a product he values."
