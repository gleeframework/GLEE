"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1500000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity,  $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider this product if you can come down to $900000. This would allow me to make a decision without risking exceeding my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This price still reflects the value of this unique opportunity, but it also shows my willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute maximum. This would allow us to close the deal and I wouldn't have to look elsewhere.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
