"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1500000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget. While the product might have potential, it's not worth risking overspending right away.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider this product if you can come down to $900,000. This would allow me to make a decision without risking exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This price still reflects the value of this unique opportunity, but it also shows my willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob more leverage to try and get a lower price. There is still room for further negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would allow us to close the deal and I wouldn't have to look elsewhere.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
