Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting $11,750 provides a significant profit over John's offer of $10,000. Holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob risks him walking away, which would leave me with the less profitable option of selling to John."
