{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize potential earnings while leaving the possibility for a counteroffer.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not going to accept an offer that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $70? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell the product for a price that's significantly below its value. I will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $70 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $85. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
