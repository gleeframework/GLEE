Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll reach a price you're comfortable with. Since John is willing to sell the product for your maximum budget of $8,000, it's the most logical choice to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
