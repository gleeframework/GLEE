Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
