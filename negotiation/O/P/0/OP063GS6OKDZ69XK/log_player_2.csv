"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $14,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000.  I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us.  There are still rounds left, and I don't want to miss out on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, we're nearing the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John.  His offer of $10,000 is within my budget, and I'm confident I can get the product from him."
