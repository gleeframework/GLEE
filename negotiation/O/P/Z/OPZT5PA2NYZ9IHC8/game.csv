"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
