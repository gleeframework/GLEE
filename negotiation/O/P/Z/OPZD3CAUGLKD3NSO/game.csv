"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also leaving room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about $1,100,000? It's a compromise that still allows me to meet my financial goals while remaining within your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, so my counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
