Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's also significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80), so he'll need to see the extra value you're highlighting. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives you leverage.  You're not desperate, which allows you to confidently price higher with Bob."
