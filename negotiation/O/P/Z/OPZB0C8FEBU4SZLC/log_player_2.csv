"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still far from your ideal target. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Considering the value to me and the fact that I have other options, I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate.  $900,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering your maximum price is $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum price is likely around $800,000.  The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear expectation for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your ideal target.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better deal by rejecting and countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussion and my need to stay within budget, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you are willing to meet halfway, while still staying within your budget. The message reiterates your desire for a fair agreement, and emphasizes that this price is beneficial for both parties."
