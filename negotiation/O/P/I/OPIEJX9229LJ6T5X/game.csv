"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12500 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11500? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12750. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I see the value in the product, $12750 is still a stretch for my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go to $12000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to explore other options.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value this product can bring to your business.
