"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite low considering the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, as it's still well below your original offer, and leaves room for us both to walk away satisfied.",12000.0,Bob,4,
