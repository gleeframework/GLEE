Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite low considering the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, as it's still well below your original offer, and leaves room for us both to walk away satisfied.
