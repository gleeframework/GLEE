"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and gauges Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential,"" hinting at value beyond Bob's current estimation. This might prompt him to counter higher than he initially would.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I'm aware that John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. I'll factor this into my willingness to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting price.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests budgetary constraints, I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss, especially with John's guaranteed offer on the table. I'll counter in the next round, aiming to bring him closer to a reasonable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But...**: I drop my price considerably to appear flexible and encourage Bob. However,  $1,750,000 remains significantly above both his offer and my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value**: I reiterate the product's ""true potential"" to nudge Bob away from his initial budget and consider a higher value.
* **Time Consideration**:  We still have several rounds for negotiation. I'll assess his response to this counteroffer before making more drastic adjustments or considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still too high for me. To be frank, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealed Value:** Bob has essentially revealed his maximum perceived value of $800,000.  
* **Unacceptable Offer:** $750,000 remains too far from my $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting would be a significant loss, especially considering John's offer. 
* **Strategic Counter:**  I'll use the next round to make a more aggressive counteroffer that takes Bob's revealed valuation into account but still pushes for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. Let's settle this right now: $1,200,000, and we have an agreement. This offer is time-sensitive; I have other potential buyers interested."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget but stand firm on a price significantly higher than his offer.
* **Compromise**:  $1,200,000 represents a substantial drop on my end, but it's still a good profit margin above my minimum.
* **Urgency and Competition**: I introduce a sense of urgency and the presence of other buyers to encourage a quick decision from Bob. This limits further back-and-forth and potential lowballs.
* **Calculated Risk**:  There's a risk Bob might walk away, but the potential reward of securing a sale well above his perceived value justifies this more assertive approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the new offer. That price is getting closer, but it's still a significant jump from my budget. To show I'm serious, I can do $800,000.  Take it or leave it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has firmly stated his maximum price ($800,000) and given an ultimatum. It's highly unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob risks missing out on John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer. 
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John ensures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further haggling with Bob.

While a deal with Bob could be tempting, John's offer represents a guaranteed, significantly better outcome at this point."
