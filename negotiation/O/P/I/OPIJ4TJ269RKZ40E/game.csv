"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting price.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still too high for me. To be frank, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. Let's settle this right now: $1,200,000, and we have an agreement. This offer is time-sensitive; I have other potential buyers interested.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the new offer. That price is getting closer, but it's still a significant jump from my budget. To show I'm serious, I can do $800,000.  Take it or leave it. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
