"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for you to still make a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.  If not, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a final compromise on my end. If you can't meet me at this price, I will unfortunately have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's close this deal,  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to finding a solution. However, I'm still not able to go lower than $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and is the absolute lowest I can go. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000, which is almost your offer. This is my absolute final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",990000.0,Bob,8,
