"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for you to still make a profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the lowest I can go.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a final compromise on my end. If you can't meet me at this price, I will unfortunately have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's close this deal,  I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $980,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I believe I can get closer to my target with a couple more rounds of negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to finding a solution. However, I'm still not able to go lower than $1,000,000.

Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000, which is almost your offer. This is my absolute final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my target, it's still not enough.  I need to ensure I get the minimum price I need, and John is willing to pay that. It's not ideal to walk away from Bob, but I need to prioritize my own financial goals."
