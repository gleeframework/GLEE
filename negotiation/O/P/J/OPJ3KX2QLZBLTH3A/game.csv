Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.,170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $155. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $145.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get what we want.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $145, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $152. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",152.0,Alice,5,
