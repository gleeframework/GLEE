"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. I understand its worth to you is $80, but I hope this offer presents a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay more than the initial asking price. After considering your offer, I am happy to accept $90 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise given the value you place on it.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $87.50. This way, we both save some money and can reach an agreement.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we settle on $89 for the product? It's slightly higher than your last offer but still lower than my previous proposals. This could be a mutually beneficial solution.",89.0,Alice,5,
