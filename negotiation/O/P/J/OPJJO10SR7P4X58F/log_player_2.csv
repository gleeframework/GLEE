Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can consider a price of $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I can offer you a compromise at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
