Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in your product, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
