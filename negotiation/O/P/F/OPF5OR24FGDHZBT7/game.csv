"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate the value it holds, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we perhaps aim for something closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and what I'm able to afford.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $900000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I need to add a bit more to it. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
