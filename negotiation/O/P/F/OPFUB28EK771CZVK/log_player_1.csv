{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential compromise while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
