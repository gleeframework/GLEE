Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $900,000. Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept given his willingness to buy, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I believe I can negotiate a better price with him, or  move on to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a significant investment for you, and it's equally valuable to me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I receive a fair return.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  $775,000 is still too low for the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm committed to making this work, but $775,000 is still too low.  It's important for me to receive a fair price, and I believe $825,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's closer to your last offer, and it ensures I can make this deal work.  Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $825,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll propose $800,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's a good deal considering the number of rounds we've gone through. It's a better outcome than selling to John for $800,000, and it allows me to close the deal quickly."
