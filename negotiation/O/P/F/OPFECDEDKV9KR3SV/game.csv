"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $900,000. Let's discuss further!",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $750,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a significant investment for you, and it's equally valuable to me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I receive a fair return.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm committed to making this work, but $775,000 is still too low.  It's important for me to receive a fair price, and I believe $825,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's closer to your last offer, and it ensures I can make this deal work.  Let's find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $825,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll propose $800,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800500.0,Bob,6,
