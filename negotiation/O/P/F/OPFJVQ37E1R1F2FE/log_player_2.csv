Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to stand by it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $13,000.  She's digging in and unlikely to budge much more.  While we could try to negotiate further, we risk:

* **Wasting time:** We're already at Round 7, and our chances of getting her significantly lower are slim.
* **Losing the opportunity with John:** John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000.  Every round we spend with Alice is a risk that something might change with John's offer.

It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed win. Buying from John saves us over $3,000 and ends the negotiation process now."
