"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Your final offer is reasonable, but I'm still hoping to land a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000?  If so, I'm ready to close the deal today.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to stand by it.",13250.0,Alice,7,
