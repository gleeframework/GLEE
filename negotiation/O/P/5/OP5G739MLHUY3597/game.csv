"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $2000000.  This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity for you.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $500000 is far too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1500000? This still represents a substantial discount from the value I place on the product, and it gives you a significant price advantage.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm willing to consider a price closer to your original offer, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Would $750000 be acceptable to you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $1250000. This is a compromise that gives you a significant price advantage while still allowing me to recoup a reasonable amount. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am very interested in this product, but I would need to stay within my budget. Would $900000 be acceptable to you?",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand you have a budget, and I'm doing my best to work within it.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this sale. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose $1000000 as the final price for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
