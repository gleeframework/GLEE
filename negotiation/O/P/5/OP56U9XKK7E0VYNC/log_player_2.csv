"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving $200,000."
