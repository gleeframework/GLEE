Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Offers a discount:**  $11,000 is less than your minimum price of $12,000.
* **Is within Bob's range:** $11,000 is still more than what Bob values the product at, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It sets the stage for Bob to make a counteroffer if he wishes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm really interested in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial offer of $10,000, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I can't go all the way down to $10,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? That's a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
