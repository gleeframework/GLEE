I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it gives Bob a chance to get a good deal if he values the product highly. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000, so there's no downside for me in offering a higher price."
