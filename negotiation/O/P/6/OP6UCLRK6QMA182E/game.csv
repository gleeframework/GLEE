"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $12,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. It's the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
