Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm looking to make a quick sale. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a high offer of $20,000 gives us room to negotiate. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if he believes the product is worth it.
* **Anchoring:**  By presenting a high initial price, we ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can always lower the price and see if we can reach a deal that's still profitable for us."
