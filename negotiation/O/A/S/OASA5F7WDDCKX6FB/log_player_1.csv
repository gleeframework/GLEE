Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be motivated to buy and might be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle.  If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my original offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this is a fair price given my minimum value and Bob's willingness to pay at least $1,500,000.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement on this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is within my acceptable range.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal that's above my minimum value.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the sale."
