"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price. It's worth exploring if I can get a lower price by counteroffering. There are 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to pay a fair price, but still below her initial offer.  It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to continue to counteroffer to see if I can get the price down even further.  I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway, but also signals I'm not willing to go much higher.  This strategy aims to put pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to my desired range without completely shutting down the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I have 5 rounds left, and there's still time to negotiate a better price. I'll reject her offer and try to push for a lower price with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of incrementally increasing my offer. I'm aiming for a price in the middle ground between our previous offers. This approach shows Alice that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and am willing to compromise. With 4 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target price.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, and I could end up buying from John at a higher price.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's very close to my goal."
