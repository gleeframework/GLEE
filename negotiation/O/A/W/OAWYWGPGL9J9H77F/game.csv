"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $11,000 is still a bit above what I'm looking to spend.  How about $9,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to make this purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",10500.0,Alice,5,
