"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's value to her ($10,000). 
* While $11,500 is less than your maximum price, you know you have a backup option with John at $12,000.
* Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's actual worth. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
