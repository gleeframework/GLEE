Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8700}"
