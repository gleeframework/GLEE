"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $10000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8700. This is still a good price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8700.0,Alice,3,
