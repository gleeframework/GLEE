I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's lower than my minimum but still allows for some room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but if he accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer and still allows for some room for negotiation. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm worried that further negotiation will take too long and I might not reach my desired price.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum and avoid any further delays."
