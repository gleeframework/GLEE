"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, while still allowing for some room for negotiation. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, but it's closer to the value I believe the product holds. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
