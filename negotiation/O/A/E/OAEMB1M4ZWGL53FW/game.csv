"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would be a more reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I'm confident the product's true value is higher.  How about we settle at $1,110,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1110000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a sweet spot at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
