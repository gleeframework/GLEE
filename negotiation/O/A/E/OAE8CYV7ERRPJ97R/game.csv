"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is quite a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
