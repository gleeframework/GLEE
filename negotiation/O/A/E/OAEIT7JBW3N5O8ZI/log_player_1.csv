"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum allows room for negotiation while signaling the product's high worth.
* **Anchoring:** The initial high price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind, potentially influencing his counteroffers to be higher than if you started lower.
* **Confidence:**  The confident tone reinforces your belief in the product's value. 

By starting high, you gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and leave yourself ample space to negotiate a favorable deal over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate. Accepting at this stage would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. You're willing to engage in further counteroffers to try and reach a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** You signal flexibility by making a significant concession ($250,000 drop), but remain firm that $1,800,000 is too low.
* **""Meet Halfway"":** This framing positions the counteroffer as a fair compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Continued Value Emphasis:**  You reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,050,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,700,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm trying to make a smart business decision here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to your absolute minimum, but you still have some negotiating room and rounds available. His mention of a ""smart business decision"" suggests he might be willing to go a little higher.  You'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer slightly above your minimum to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to make a smart decision, and I appreciate you coming up on the price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,850,000? This represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the product's value will more than justify it in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding and Acknowledgement:** You start by showing Bob you understand his position and appreciate his efforts in the negotiation.
* **Bridging the Gap:** You make a smaller concession this time, moving closer to his price but staying significantly above your absolute minimum. 
* **Long-Term Value Emphasis:** You subtly shift the focus from the immediate price to the product's long-term value proposition, subtly justifying the higher price.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's Limit:** By proposing a price just above your minimum, you can gauge if he's willing to meet you there.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** You're still aiming for a price that provides a substantial profit. 
* **Keep Negotiations Moving:**  You avoid stalling the negotiation by making another offer and keeping the dialogue open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Alice, but I still think $1,850,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,725,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is a significant profit above your $1,500,000 minimum and a good compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or getting stuck at a lower price. It's unlikely you'll get much higher than this.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows you to move on to other opportunities.

While you could potentially push for a bit more, the current offer represents a strong deal. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids unnecessary risk."
