"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. A $14,000 offer is within his budget and represents a substantial discount. This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiation and demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it is still higher than his desired price point.  Bob is willing to negotiate further.  He can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. Additionally, John is offering the product for $15,000, providing Bob with a solid alternative if he can't reach a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by making a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's latest offer but still within his budget.  This strategy shows he is serious about buying the product while maintaining his goal of saving money.  He is also using John's offer as leverage in the negotiation, aiming to reach a price that is closer to the $15,000 John is offering."
