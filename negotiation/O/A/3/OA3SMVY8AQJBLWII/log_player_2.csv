"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. This product is worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential value. I believe it could be even more valuable in your hands. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  What do you think about $2000000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.
