(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for under $800,000. Alice's first offer is way too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting his counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully push Alice to consider a more reasonable price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. Even though it's lower than the previous offer, Bob can still try to negotiate further. He is willing to pay $800,000 for the product, and Alice is likely to come down in price with continued negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product.  He's still well below Alice's desired price but is hoping to find a middle ground. The goal is to find a price where both parties can agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still too high. Bob is confident that he can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's not in a rush and has the option of buying from John, so he's not pressured to accept anything higher than his desired $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price.  He's reached his target price, and this should be the last offer he makes before buying from John if Alice doesn't accept.  Alice is likely to accept, as this is a much better price than her previous offers, and she's still making a profit."
