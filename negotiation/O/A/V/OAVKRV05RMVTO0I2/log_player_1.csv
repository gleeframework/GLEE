"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a decent starting point since the product is worth $120 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his. I believe this is a fair price, but I'm still open to negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92.5. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's still a good deal for me, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
