Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is too low for me to consider.  To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable going that high.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
