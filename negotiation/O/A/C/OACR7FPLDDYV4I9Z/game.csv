"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $140 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. How about $155? I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",155.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to go down to $155. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $165? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",165.0,Alice,5,,
