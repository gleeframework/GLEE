"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's below his maximum, there's room for negotiation to potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of the product's value, I understand your desire for a more favorable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant discount and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The price is now at $1,100,000, which is below his maximum of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting again and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
