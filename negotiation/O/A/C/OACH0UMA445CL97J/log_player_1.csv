Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. I believe this price is fair considering the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,300,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
