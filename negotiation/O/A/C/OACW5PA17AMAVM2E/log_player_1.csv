Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $1,200,000, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him some incentive to accept, but also allows for some negotiation if he wants a lower price.
* **It sets a clear starting point:** This initial offer sets the tone for the negotiation and signals that you're serious about selling. 

By offering a price that's both profitable for you and attractive to Bob, you increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can come to a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1300000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is still above your minimum, it's a significant drop from your initial offer. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price before settling.  You have a good negotiating position because you know the product's worth more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at that price.  Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** It demonstrates your flexibility and openness to a deal, while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Compromises but doesn't concede too much:**  $1,350,000 is a good middle ground, getting you closer to your initial offer while still being a better deal for Bob than his last offer.
* **Reinforces the product's value:** By mentioning the product's value to Bob, you keep that point in his mind and encourage him to see the value in accepting your offer."
