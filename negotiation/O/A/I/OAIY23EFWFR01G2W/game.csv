"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $8,000.  I'd prefer to buy from you, but only if we can get closer to that price point. Would you consider $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you've found a similar product for $8,000, but mine is unique and offers additional value.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
