I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it also ensures I'm getting a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable value.  It's important to start high, but also be prepared to negotiate to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I'm not getting the price I wanted, it's not worth selling for the minimum amount at this stage.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can use this opportunity to negotiate further. I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000.  This shows flexibility but still keeps a healthy profit margin. It's important to meet Bob halfway, but not concede too much at this stage."

Bob has come up slightly in his offer, and while it's still not my ideal price, it's a decent profit and it seems like he's willing to negotiate.  At this point, it's more likely I'll get a better price if I continue to negotiate, but there's a risk that he'll walk away entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
