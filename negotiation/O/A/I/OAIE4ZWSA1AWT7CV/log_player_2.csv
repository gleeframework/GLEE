# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, at least $800000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  It's a substantial investment, but I believe the value it holds for you could be even greater. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
