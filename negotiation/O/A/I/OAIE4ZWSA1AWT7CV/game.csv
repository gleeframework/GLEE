"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, at least $800000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  It's a substantial investment, but I believe the value it holds for you could be even greater. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
