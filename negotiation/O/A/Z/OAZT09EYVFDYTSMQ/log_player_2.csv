"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum value of $1,000,000. He can still get the product from John for the same price, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only able to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still a profit for you and within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
