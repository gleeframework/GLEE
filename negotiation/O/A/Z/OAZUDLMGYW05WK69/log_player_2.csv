"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $150. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price, as it's truly valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $100 to you, and she's asking for $150. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand where you're coming from, but I can't let it go for that low. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really only able to pay $110. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 110}
