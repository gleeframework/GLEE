"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll reconsider. ",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
