{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is likely to see this as a good deal since he values it at $1,200,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially get more, but this price sets a good foundation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am not able to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's better than selling to John right now. 

Let's try to see if we can push Bob a little closer to your initial offer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to come down from your initial offer.
* **Is still above your minimum:** $975,000 is higher than your floor of $800,000.
* **Leaves a small margin:** You're giving Bob a small space to bargain, but it's not a huge concession.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving while still maximizing your profit."
