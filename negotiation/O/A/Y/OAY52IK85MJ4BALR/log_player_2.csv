"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a price that I think is a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $15,000 from John, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to pay closer to $13,000.  I know you're willing to sell for less than John, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I can go, considering its value to me is $12,000 to you is $15,000, so I'm giving you a good discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's able to get the product for $13,500, which is less than the $15,000 he'd pay John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying more. It's better to lock in this deal and save $1,500."
