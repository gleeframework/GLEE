"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $90 is above your maximum budget of $80.
* **It's worth negotiating:** There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $80, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $80 provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $75 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum value. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to compromise. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects, I'll have room to adjust my offer up slightly in the next round if necessary."
