{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing us to still potentially secure a price higher than $150. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that price."
