Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll be watching Bob's response closely and will be prepared to adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial price, to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully it's a price that Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it. I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and selling to John at $1,200,000 is only slightly less. It's time to close the deal."
