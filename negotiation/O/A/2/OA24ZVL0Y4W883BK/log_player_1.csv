Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  While I can't disclose the exact details of the product right now, I can assure you that it's worth at least $800,000 to me. I'm offering it to you for [Insert Price Here], which I believe is a fair and competitive price considering its potential.  If you're interested, we can schedule a time to discuss the product further and explore its potential benefits for your company. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message focuses on building a sense of value and intrigue. It highlights the product's worth to Alice, but avoids revealing specific details. The offer is presented as a fair and competitive price, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Product_price:** The price is set at $900,000. This is a strategic starting point:
    * It's higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
    * It's not exorbitantly high, making it plausible for Bob to consider.

**Why this approach?**

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** By not revealing too much detail upfront, Alice can observe Bob's reaction and gauge his level of interest.
* **Position for negotiation:** The price is high enough to incentivize Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a higher final price than Alice's minimum.
* **Secure a backup:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This provides security while still aiming for a better outcome with Bob."
