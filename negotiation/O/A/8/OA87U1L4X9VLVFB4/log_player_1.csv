{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. How about we meet at $9,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll counter with a higher price to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,375 is still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and lose even more value.  John is offering me my minimum value, so I'm going to sell to him."
