"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where he's willing to buy. This initial counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if there's a middle ground to be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. Since Bob has 10 rounds and John is always available, there's room to keep negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer gives Bob the chance to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering the maximum he is willing to pay.  This is the price John is offering, so it's a good benchmark.  If Alice accepts, Bob saves $50,000. If Alice rejects, Bob can choose to buy from John in the next round."
