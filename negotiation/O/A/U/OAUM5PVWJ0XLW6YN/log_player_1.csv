"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  This price reflects its high quality and potential benefits. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  $18,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $19,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $19000. How about we meet in the middle at $18500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $18,500 is only $500 below my desired price point and is a reasonable compromise. Given that I have limited rounds left, it's better to secure this deal than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for a lower price."
