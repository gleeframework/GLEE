"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price given the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still represents a great deal for you, and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,600,000. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal now.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,500,000. This product is valuable, and I need to ensure a fair return on my investment.  However, I'm willing to consider a payment plan that spreads the cost over a few months if that helps make the deal more manageable for you.  Let's discuss this further to see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1500000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to consider a payment plan, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the total price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to consider a payment plan, but I'd like to cap the total price at $1,400,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,8,
