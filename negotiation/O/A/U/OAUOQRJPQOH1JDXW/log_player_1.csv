Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so Alice needs to offer it below that to entice him but leave room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 from John, so she has leverage.

**The offer:**  By starting at $1,100,000, Alice creates a strong starting point for negotiation. 

* **If Bob accepts:** Alice makes a significant profit above her minimum.
* **If Bob negotiates:**  There's space to go down while still staying above John's offer.
* **If Bob rejects:** Alice can move to John and still get her desired price."
