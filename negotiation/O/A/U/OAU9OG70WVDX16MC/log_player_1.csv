Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at $10,000 allows for a $2,000 profit for you while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($2,000 less than his perceived value).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, the message leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate if he wants it for slightly less.  
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
