"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,500,000 from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $1,200,000. This shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It's also a reasonable starting point, considering Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high. While it's lower than John's offer, you can likely still negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get the product for closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Alice's offer is $1,400,000, and your previous offer was $1,000,000. This counteroffer of $1,100,000 splits the difference, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.
* **Value for Alice:**  While $1,100,000 is less than what Alice would like, it's still significantly above her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  This counteroffer keeps you from having to settle for John's higher price of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Maximum:** $1,300,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  
* **Better Than John:** This offer is significantly cheaper than buying from John.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice would budge further.  At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
