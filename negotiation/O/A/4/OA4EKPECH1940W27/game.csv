"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, I need to be closer to $2,000,000 to make this work. Would you consider $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,775,000?",1775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I can see we both see the inherent value here.  How about we settle at $1,850,000?  This would represent significant movement on my side and get us very close to an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,850,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $1,725,000?",1725000.0,Bob,6,
