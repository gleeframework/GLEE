Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,850,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $1,725,000?

While we're still above John's offer, Bob is consistently moving up, and we're getting into diminishing returns territory.  Better to accept the solid offer on the table now."
