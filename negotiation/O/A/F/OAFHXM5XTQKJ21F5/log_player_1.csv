Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a good profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential gain he could experience.
* **Fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""fair price"" to avoid appearing unreasonable or greedy. 
* **Openness:** I ask for Bob's opinion to encourage engagement and potential counteroffers. 

**Next steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to gauge his willingness to pay and adjust my counter-counteroffer accordingly. If the negotiation stalls, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 as a backup plan."
