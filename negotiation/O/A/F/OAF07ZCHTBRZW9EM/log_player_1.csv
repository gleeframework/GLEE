Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher. He's already above his perceived value of the product and is only incrementally increasing his offer. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for an uncertain outcome."
