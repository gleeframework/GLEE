"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not going to accept that offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130.  It's still above my minimum, but a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I will continue to negotiate with Bob.  I believe I can get a better price, and I have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a further compromise, but it's still a reasonable price considering my minimum and the fact that Bob is showing some interest in the product.  It's also a price that leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$105 is still below my minimum, but it's getting close.  I'm not going to accept it yet, as I believe I can get closer to my target price.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to start considering the potential of selling to John.  But I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. This is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John in the next round."
