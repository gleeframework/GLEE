I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum.  Although I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing too much time.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
