"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $20,000 reflects the true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price point offers a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $16,000. Would you be willing to meet at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. It's getting closer.  To be honest though, I have a firm budget, and $14,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to make the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
