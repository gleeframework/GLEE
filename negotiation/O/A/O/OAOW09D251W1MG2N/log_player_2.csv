"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to get a good deal. It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiations, as it's well within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value to you is significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price, closer to his initial counteroffer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating flexibility while still sticking to his goal of a lower price.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a price closer to his desired range."
