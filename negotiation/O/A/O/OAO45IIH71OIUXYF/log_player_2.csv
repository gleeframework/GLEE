"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its potential.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's in my best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down in price, especially since she values the product at $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $800,000, especially given its potential future applications.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth while still providing you a strong return on investment.  What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'm going to reject her offer and continue negotiating. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower, especially since I've already indicated my maximum price."
