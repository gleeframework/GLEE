"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its potential.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in the product, your price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll bring to it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $800,000, especially given its potential future applications.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth while still providing you a strong return on investment.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I see the value in the product,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's current value and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
