"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $11,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $12,500 for this product. This is still a great price for you, given its value. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $12,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,750. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $12,125.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $11,900, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough choice, but I'm going to sell to John. While I would like to get a bit more, I'm worried that if I keep negotiating with Bob, I might end up with a lower price or run out of time. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the safest option at this point."
