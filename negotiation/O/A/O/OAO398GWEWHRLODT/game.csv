"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $12,500 for this product. This is still a great price for you, given its value. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $12,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,750. This is my final offer for now.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $12,125.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $11,900, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make this work.",11900.0,Bob,6,
