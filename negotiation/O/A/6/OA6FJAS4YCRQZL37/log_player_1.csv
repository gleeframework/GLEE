Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still being a significant profit for you.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $119 seems more appealing and ""cheaper"" than a rounded $120, potentially swaying Bob.

**Important:** Even if Bob counters, you should stick close to $119 or accept John's offer.  There's no reason to go below $119 since John guarantees that amount."
