"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is fair, given the value of the product and the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its value and potential benefits, while also being a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This price acknowledges your need to make a profit while allowing me to acquire the product at a price that makes sense for me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,075,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,090,000 for the product. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
