``` 

It's definitely worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $8,500 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high.  Let's see if we can get her lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $7,500.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $7,800, which is a good price.  It's getting closer to my target, and I don't want to risk her raising the price again or losing the deal entirely.  It's time to accept her offer."
