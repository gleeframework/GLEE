# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 to you at an attractive price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I would like to maintain a fair value for my product. I am proposing a price of $11,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point. At $11,000, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to John's price of $15,000.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting the offer at this point is a smart move as it minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
