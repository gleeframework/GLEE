Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still has $100,000 of potential gain if he accepts, making it a worthwhile deal for him. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** If Bob rejects, you still have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you a decent profit.

By offering a price that is both beneficial to you and appealing to Bob, you increase your chances of getting a good deal while also minimizing your risk."
