"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to recover some of the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your response. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's a bit high. Would you consider $950,000 as a reasonable offer? I believe this would be beneficial for both parties involved.",950000.0,Bob,4,
