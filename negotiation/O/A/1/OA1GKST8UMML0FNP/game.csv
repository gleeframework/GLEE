"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product. It's my maximum budget, but I think it's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. I think this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
