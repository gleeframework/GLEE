"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product. It's my maximum budget, but I think it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. I think this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than my maximum budget.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems unlikely she'll go much lower.  To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget."
