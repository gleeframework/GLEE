"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really value. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a bit more than that. How does $100 sound? You'd be getting it for less than its worth to you, and I'd be able to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
