"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $950,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $775,000?  That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that I've already met you halfway. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 even though I have John's offer.  This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to meet my minimum value. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
