,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer of $120, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to compromise, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",115.0,Bob,4,
