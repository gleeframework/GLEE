Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a bit more than $75. I can do $80 for the product, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, but I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to her value for the product. There's no point in negotiating further, as she's unlikely to go any lower. Accepting this offer gets me the product for a good price."
