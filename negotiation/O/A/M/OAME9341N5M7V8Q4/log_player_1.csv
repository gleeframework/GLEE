"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get a good price within the 10 rounds, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly less than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair price that allows both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $9,750? It's the best I can do, but I really want to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable.  I'm not willing to give up that much profit, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to go below $10,000. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,000. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
