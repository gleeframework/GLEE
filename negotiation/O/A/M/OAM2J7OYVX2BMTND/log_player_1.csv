"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Bargaining:** This initial offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still giving me a strong starting position.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and open message sets a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While $90 is better than John's offer of $80, I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **More negotiation room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **10 Rounds:** I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $120 to $105. 
* **Strong Position:**  $105 is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum of $80.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the fairness of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I am serious about buying it. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $97 is not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in further concessions, and I may end up selling to John for $80.
* **Time Constraints:**  I'm already in round 4, and further rounds might not lead to a significantly higher offer.

This offer from Bob is a good compromise, and accepting it allows me to secure a sale at a price that is still profitable for me."
