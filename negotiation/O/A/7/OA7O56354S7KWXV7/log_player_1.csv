"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay more than he initially thought."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small amount. I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to Bob, but also still profitable for me."
