Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs. We are offering this exceptional product to you at an exclusive price of $1200000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a competitive rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's perceived value of $1,500,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better align with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product, I am pleased to counteroffer at $1100000. This price takes into account both the product's quality and your willingness to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I value the product,  $1,100,000 remains slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair balance between the product's worth and my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. In light of your latest offer, I am pleased to counteroffer at $1075000. This price aims to provide a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it is still higher than the price he can get from John. Since Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, buying the product from John for $1,000,000 is the most financially beneficial option at this point.  The negotiation with Alice is unlikely to lead to a price lower than John's offer.  The risk of the negotiation continuing is too high as it could lead to a higher price from Alice and the risk of losing the opportunity with John."
