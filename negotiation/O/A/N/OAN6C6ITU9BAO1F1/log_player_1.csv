{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts with a slightly inflated price, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I want to make as much money as possible, but also keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great product and I think it's worth the investment. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $95 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I would prefer to make more, Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $100, and I don't want to risk him continuing to lower his offer. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
