"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value, I'm asking for $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its potential for you.  Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,400,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,575,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.  Let me know your thoughts.",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,575,000 is still slightly out of my price range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,525,000 for the product. This is a fair price given the value of the product, and it gets us much closer to a deal. Let's make it happen.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
