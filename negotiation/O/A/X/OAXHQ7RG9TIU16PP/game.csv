"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's truly a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is very interesting to me, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm targeting something closer to $800,000. Would that work for you?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price around $825,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort we've put into this negotiation. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I want to close this deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $812,500?",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $815,000, which is just a small step away from your offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into this negotiation. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
