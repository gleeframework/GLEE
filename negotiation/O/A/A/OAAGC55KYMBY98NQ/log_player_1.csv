Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find common ground."

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $912,500 is a good deal and gets me closer to my desired price.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal by continuing to negotiate."
