"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $8,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push Bob higher, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $8,250. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet halfway. I believe this could be a good middle ground and lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle for a price below $8,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $8,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to it. This is a risky move, as I'm essentially giving him my lowest price, but I'm running out of rounds and want to secure a deal."
