"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you like to make an offer on the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the product's worth to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation. Buying from John immediately would be settling for your absolute maximum price without even attempting to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's important to start significantly below your actual maximum price to give yourself room to negotiate upwards. This offer also leaves Alice with the possibility of still making a profit, even if it's less than her ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, $10,000 is still higher than your ideal price. You can afford to push for a lower price and see how she responds.  There are still several rounds of negotiation left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we try $7,000?  That's a fair price, and it would let me get this great product from you."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer moves closer to your maximum price while still leaving room for some negotiation. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise but also shows Alice you're serious about getting a better deal.  By framing it as a ""fair price,"" you subtly manage her expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you like the product, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price you'd consider, but there's still room for negotiation. While $9,000 is only $1,000 more than your backup option with John, it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your $8,000 goal.  There's no rush to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice! I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal. How about we split the difference and land at $8,000? That would be a win-win for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Now is the time to stand firm at your maximum price. You've negotiated patiently and shown Alice you're willing to compromise. This offer is still beneficial for Alice, as it's well above her product's worth to her. By framing it as a ""win-win,"" you emphasize the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my original offer, which was $15,000. Let's try $11,000, and see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has backtracked significantly and moved further away from a reasonable negotiation point. This suggests she's either not willing to budge or is employing a tactic to make you doubt your position.  At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price than your guaranteed option with John. You've negotiated fairly and reached your maximum price; it's time to walk away and secure the product at your target price."
