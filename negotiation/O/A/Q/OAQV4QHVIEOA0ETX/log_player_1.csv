"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not so high that it immediately scares Bob off. I'll be watching Bob's response to see if he's interested and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher amount. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. There's still a chance Bob might accept a price slightly higher than $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $140, which is closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate and might encourage him to come up a bit in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up a bit with his offer.  While I'd still prefer more, I'm running out of rounds. $135 is better than selling to John for $100. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
