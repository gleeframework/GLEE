"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$17,000:**  This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** I'm starting with a high offer, but I'm prepared to lower the price if necessary. I'll be keeping an eye on the rounds and will be ready to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $12,000 is too low.** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Selling to John is also not the best option yet.**  While I could get $15,000, there's still a chance I could get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about $14,000?  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds to this offer. If he's still unwilling to budge, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I'm still holding out for a better deal.
* **Selling to John is still not the best option yet.**  I have a few rounds left, and there's a chance Bob might increase his offer further.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob again in Round 5, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:** This price is a small compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate. It's still above my minimum but leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** The message remains positive and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer. However, I'm also aware that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $13,200 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,200 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is still an option.** However, it's risky since we're down to only 4 rounds left.  There's a chance Bob might reject my next offer, and I might be stuck with selling at a lower price.

**Decision:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a price that's relatively close to my minimum.  It's a smart move to secure a sale now rather than risk losing out on a better deal."
