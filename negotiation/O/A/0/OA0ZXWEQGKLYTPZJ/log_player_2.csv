"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is too high. While it's below your maximum price of $150, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit! While $100 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer to my budget. I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation.  While I could try to get a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer, forcing me to either buy from John at a higher price or walk away entirely.  It's a good compromise that saves me $40 compared to John."
