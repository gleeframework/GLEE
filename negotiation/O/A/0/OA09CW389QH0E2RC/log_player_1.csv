{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it can bring to your business is well worth it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also including a message that acknowledges the potential value to Bob, which could help him see the product's worth. 

We'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I still believe this product holds a higher value and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique and has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 
 
I'm adjusting my offer to $900,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. My message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum of $800,000 and seems like a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
