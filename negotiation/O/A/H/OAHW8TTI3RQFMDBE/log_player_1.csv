Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good value for him, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him. However, I'm prepared to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm rejecting his offer because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with a price of $11,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, considering the value he places on the product."
