{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a bit more than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is more than what John is offering, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,750 is still a good deal for me.  It's more than what John is offering, and Bob seems determined to get the product."
