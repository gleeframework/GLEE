"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $12,500 is still a little too high for me.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $12,200, but that's as low as I can go. I really think this product is worth it to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12200.0,Alice,5,
