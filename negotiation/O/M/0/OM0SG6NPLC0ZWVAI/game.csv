"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number that reflects the value this product brings.  How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to maximize the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to what I believe is a fair price.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Your willingness to move up shows you recognize the value here. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your investment.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Would you consider a final offer of $975,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
