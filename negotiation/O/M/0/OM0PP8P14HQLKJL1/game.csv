"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  While $137.50 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $143.75?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",143.75,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $140?",140.0,Bob,6,
