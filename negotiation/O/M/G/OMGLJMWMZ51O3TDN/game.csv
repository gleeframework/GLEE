"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,150,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,225,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,225,000. I'm thinking more in the range of $1,175,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,175,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the price John is offering. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
