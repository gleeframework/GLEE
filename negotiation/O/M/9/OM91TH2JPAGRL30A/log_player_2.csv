It's always worth trying to get a better deal.  Since you have a backup option with John, you can afford to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's 10% lower than Alice's offer. This will give us room to negotiate while still leaving Alice with a substantial profit."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not my ideal price. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to offer a price that's slightly higher than my previous counteroffer, but still below Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want a good deal."

Alice has come down in price again, and we're getting closer to a deal.  While I'd prefer a lower price,  $840,000 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John. It's time to secure this deal."
