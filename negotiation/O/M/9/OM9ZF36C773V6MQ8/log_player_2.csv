"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer:** $1,200,000, which is Bob's limit.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price.  He has room to counteroffer before reaching his maximum budget.  There's a chance he can get a better deal with Alice than John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $1,100,000.
* **Bob's counteroffer:** $1,050,000.

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's original price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both parties while still saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $1,080,000, which is within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer:** $1,200,000.

This is a better deal than John's offer, so it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
