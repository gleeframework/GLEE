"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for $18,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way over his budget and there are more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his $10,000 limit. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating, aiming to get the price lower. There are still many rounds left, and he might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer. I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $13,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go up to $14,000. That's my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already gotten the price down significantly from her initial offer and $14,000 is within his budget. While he could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't go lower, and he could end up losing the deal or having to buy from John for the same price."
