"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,250 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
