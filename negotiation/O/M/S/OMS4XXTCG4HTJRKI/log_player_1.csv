{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering the product at $110, which is a good compromise between my minimum price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). It gives Bob a good discount while still allowing me to make a profit. 

I'll be ready to negotiate further if he rejects the offer.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept an offer that low. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $100,  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's a good compromise, and I'd rather make a deal with Bob than risk losing him completely and having to sell to John."
