Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remember that $150 is your minimum price, so anything above that is a profit.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept $120, it's below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $150 but closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, I'd rather take the guaranteed $150 from John.  There's no point in risking getting less for the product by continuing to haggle with Bob."
