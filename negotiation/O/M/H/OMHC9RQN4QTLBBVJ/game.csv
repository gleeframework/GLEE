"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! While $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
