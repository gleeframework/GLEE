"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price from Alice. Even though $12,000 is higher than Alice's value of $8,000, it's still lower than your maximum value of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $10,000, which is a significant discount from her initial offer of $12,000. This price is still above her value of $8,000, making it likely she'll consider it. It also gives me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still within my acceptable range and significantly lower than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves me $3,500 compared to John's price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings from a lower offer."
