"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a revised price of $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1150000, which would be $1075000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1075000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a revised price of $1125000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1125000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
