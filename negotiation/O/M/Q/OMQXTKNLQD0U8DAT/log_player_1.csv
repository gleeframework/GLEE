"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, as I mentioned before, but I'm not willing to go above that. However, I'm willing to make a small concession and meet you at $1,085,000. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,075,000 and incrementally increasing his offers. We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and I believe we have room to push further. Accepting his offer now might leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I also know the value of this product. Let's not get bogged down in small increments.  I'm proposing $1,100,000 â€“ a clean and fair offer that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations. It's time to apply some pressure and signal a willingness to walk away if necessary. 
* **Clean Number:** Offering a round number like $1,100,000 feels more significant and might be more appealing to Bob than another incremental increase. 
* **Balance:** This offer still leaves room for Bob to make a counter-offer above his $1,075,000 anchor point, while keeping us firmly above John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, as I mentioned before. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession and meet you at $1,080,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to small increments around his desired price.  It's clear he's highly interested but trying to extract the most value.  We need to increase the pressure and signal that our price is firming up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible throughout this negotiation, but we're running out of time.  My final offer is $1,095,000.  I believe it's more than fair, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1095000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  We're down to the wire.  Clearly stating this is our final offer leaves the decision firmly in Bob's hands.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering $1,095,000 shows some movement and might be enough to get Bob over the line without sacrificing too much potential profit.
* **Alternative:** We're still above John's offer, so we have a strong walk-away point if Bob rejects this final attempt."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to exceed that number. I'll meet you at $1,080,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has made it abundantly clear that $1,075,000 (with a tiny budge to $1,080,000) is his absolute limit. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** We've spent considerable time and effort negotiating with Bob. Accepting his offer now would only net us $80,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. There's a chance we could find another buyer willing to pay closer to our desired price in the time saved.
* **Strong BATNA:**  Having a solid backup offer from John strengthens our position. It allows us to walk away from a less-than-ideal deal with Bob, knowing we have a safety net."
