Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's a significant purchase, but I truly believe in its value and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a slightly higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,999 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and a potential ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and avoids any mention of other potential buyers, creating a sense of exclusivity.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale with Bob."
