"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for some room for us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product. Let's reach an agreement so we can both move forward.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to meet me halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $11,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's close this deal, and both of us can walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $11,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous negotiations.
