{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my $120 minimum as possible, but I'm also willing to negotiate if Bob makes a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $120. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I can't go as low as $90, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant distance from what I'd like to get. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be willing to meet me at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation is going on for too long, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much. Even though I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $120, it's more than Bob's offer, and it's time to move on."
