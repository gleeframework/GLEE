Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $1,100,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:**  I highlight the product's worth to me to emphasize the potential value Bob is getting.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is still a fair price given the value it offers, while also allowing me to save some money. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 I can get from John. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain the pressure on him.  My next counteroffer will aim to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This represents a significant discount from the value I place on this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for him to make a final concession. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the value of the product to me, implying that $1,075,000 is a good deal for him.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm making it clear that I'm ready to finalize the sale and avoid further negotiations. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I know I can get a better price elsewhere, but I'm giving Bob one more chance to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,075,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,060,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. However, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob would likely result in further back and forth, consuming valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me the best possible price and avoids any further risk or uncertainty.
* **Walking away:**  While I could try to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, it's not worth the effort. John is a reliable buyer, and the guaranteed $1,200,000 is more beneficial to me at this stage."
