"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be a great asset for your business too. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1 million to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000?  This gives us both some room to breathe. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
