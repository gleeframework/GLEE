"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but could you consider a lower price? How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
