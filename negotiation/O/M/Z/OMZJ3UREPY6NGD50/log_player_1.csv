Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  This gives her leverage to start significantly higher.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number.  It uses language like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to frame the offer as something special and valuable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. Alice can then potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still securing a profit well above her minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Alice could choose to open with a lower price to encourage a quick sale. However, starting high maximizes her potential profit."
