Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but it's still a decent offer. Since I can sell the product to John for $10,000, I'll consider that option. However, I'll also consider the potential of getting a better offer from Bob.

I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to the $15,000 value he has for the product.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $10,500, I'll try to get closer to the $15,000 value he has for the product. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than the maximum value he has for the product.
