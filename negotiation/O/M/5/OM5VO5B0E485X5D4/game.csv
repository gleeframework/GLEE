"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which still leaves room for a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous counteroffer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the value this product holds. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $1,125,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a number that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,110,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can seal the deal with this offer.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
