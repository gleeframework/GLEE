{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, something truly unique. I'm sure you'll find it highly valuable. My starting price is $1,500,000. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting the product's value to me. It also invites further negotiation, leaving room for compromise. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable, and this offer positions me for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe the product's worth justifies a higher offer, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm not quite there yet. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1350000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1275000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what John is offering and still above my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the sale."
