"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a good compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a deal for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
