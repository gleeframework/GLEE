"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($15,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a good value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is open ended, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think it's worth more than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 9 more rounds to work with. I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Potential to Get Closer to My Value:** While $15,000 is my floor, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation.

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $12,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm on Value:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, clearly stating that it reflects the true value of the product.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting him halfway between his offer ($12,000) and my initial offer ($18,000).
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $15,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $13,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Although Bob is moving closer to my desired price,  it's not yet a point I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Time to Increase the Pressure:**  With more rounds remaining, I'm not desperate. I will counteroffer to try and get closer to my price point.

I'll counteroffer again, but I might start considering John's offer if we don't reach a suitable agreement in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still significantly lower than the value I'm placing on this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:**  I'm showing that I'm open to further negotiation by lowering my price again.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($15,000) and Bob's latest offer ($13,500).
* **Urgency and Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.

While I'm still a bit away from my ideal price, I'm starting to consider John's offer if this round doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,500, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $14,500, which would be $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Getting Closer:**  While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, we are still $1,000 apart.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially needing to sell to John, but I'm determined to get as close to my target price as possible.

I will counteroffer again in the next round, but if we don't reach an agreement, I'll start seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $14,250, which is a significant concession on my part. This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you've been wanting."", ""product_price"": 14250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping to $14,250, showing I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great opportunity"" to secure it.
* **Urgency:** I'm reiterating the need to close the deal to build a sense of urgency.

With only 3 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach an agreement. If this counteroffer isn't accepted, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $14,250, which would be $14,125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $14,125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still not enough.
* **Time is Extremely Limited:**  With only two rounds left, the odds of reaching a deal that satisfies my minimum price are slim.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations.

At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John secures my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the uncertainty of further rounds with Bob."
