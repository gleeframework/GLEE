"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He can do better by either counteroffering Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

While $10,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He can do better by either counteroffering Alice again or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous offer.

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, this is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, making it the best option."
