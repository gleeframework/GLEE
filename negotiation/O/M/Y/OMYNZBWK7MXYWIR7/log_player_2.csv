Alice's offer is way too high.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. I'm hoping this will start the negotiation process and we can find a price we're both comfortable with."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $750,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still within my budget.  I'm hoping this will convince her to accept and close the deal."
