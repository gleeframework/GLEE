"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is simply beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues what it offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product while still allowing you to reap substantial benefits from it.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's be realistic,  the value this product brings is substantial, and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to consider  $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for a product of this caliber.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product,  $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both stand to gain.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
