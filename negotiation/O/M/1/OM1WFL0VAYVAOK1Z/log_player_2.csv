"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too risky to accept without knowing more about the product and its value to Alice.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her original price, $10,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe there's still room for a compromise. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both of our interests.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. It's a compromise that still leaves some room for profit, but I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still $1,500 more than I'm willing to pay.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price, especially since we are nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our interests.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
