"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $18,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
