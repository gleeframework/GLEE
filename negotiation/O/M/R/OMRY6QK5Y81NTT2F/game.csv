"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which still allows me to make a decent profit. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still not meeting my needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  and offer the product for $1,425,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it gives you a significant saving compared to my initial offer. If you are still not convinced, I will be forced to consider other offers.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
