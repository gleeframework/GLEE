"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's both profitable for me and acceptable to Bob.  I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,500. This is a compromise, but it's still a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a significant concession from my last offer, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair compromise. We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to ensure that we close before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000,  it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher. We're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting $11,000 is still a good profit for me and ensures I don't have to sell to John for $10,000."
