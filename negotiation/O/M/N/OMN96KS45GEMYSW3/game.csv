"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $11,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I may have to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
