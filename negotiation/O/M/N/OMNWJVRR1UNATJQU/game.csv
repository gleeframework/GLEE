"Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,900,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about $1,950,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I'm thinking $1,850,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential return on investment. I'm hoping we can meet here.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
