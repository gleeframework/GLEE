# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I'm thinking $1,850,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential return on investment. I'm hoping we can meet here.

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are now above my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
