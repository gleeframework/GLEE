Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Offering $115 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** Bob might be willing to pay a little more than $100, so this offer could lead to a deal.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can still counteroffer or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Threshold:**  My minimum acceptable price is $120. Bob's offer of $105 is significantly below that.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I can still make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  Bob has expressed interest and might be willing to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $105 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $115 but still above Bob's offer.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Opportunity for Agreement:**  This price might be more appealing to Bob, and could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting close to a deal, but I still think $108 is the highest I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $108 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks lowering the price further and taking up more time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees a sale at my minimum price, ensuring a profit and a quick transaction.
* **Time Factor:**  The time spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost, as I could be selling to John and securing the profit."
