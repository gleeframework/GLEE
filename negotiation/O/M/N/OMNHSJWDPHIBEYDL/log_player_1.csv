"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value.  I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price,  $1,000,000, as a starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for potential concessions and helps me maximize my profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique value and potential to Bob. This is an attempt to pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for negotiation, showing flexibility. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  The negotiation strategy will need to be adjusted based on Bob's responses and the unfolding dynamics of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe the product has potential, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $800,000,  I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push the price up. 

**Strategy:**

* **Focus on Value:** In the next round, I'll reiterate the product's unique value and emphasize the potential upside for Bob. 
* **Counter Offer:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Time is Key:**  With 9 rounds left, I have time to work towards a better deal.  

**Next Steps:**  I'll need to carefully assess the potential risks and benefits of continuing the negotiation with Bob versus selling to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product holds even more value than that, especially considering its unique features and potential for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  This is a significant investment, and I believe it will be well worth it for you. "", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $950,000. This shows flexibility without conceding too much.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer, hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm weighing the risk of losing the deal entirely against the potential reward of a higher price.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm remaining flexible but also demonstrating my resolve to achieve a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a compromise: $925000. I think this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  Given that we're already at Round 4, and considering the risk of further negotiation, I believe it's time to accept this offer.

**Key Factors:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $925,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  
* **Potential Future Negotiations:**  Even if I were to reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that we'd reach a better price in the remaining rounds. 

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $925,000 is the best choice in this situation.  It allows me to secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
