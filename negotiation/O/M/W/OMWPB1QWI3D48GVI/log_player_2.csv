"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above what the product is worth to her.  There's room for negotiation, and you want to try and save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still a decent profit for her, considering her minimum value for the product is $12,000. This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation where you can potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. $13,000 is closer but still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is only $500 more than your counteroffer.  This is a reasonable compromise, and accepting the offer allows you to purchase the product within your budget while securing a good deal. Buying from John for $15,000 would cost you more."
