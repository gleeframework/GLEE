Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is far more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a better option with John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $160 is closer to his limit, it's still more than what he can get from John.  There's no need to risk getting stuck paying more."

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget. He's offering a price that's higher than John's but still lower than Alice's previous offer. This shows he's willing to negotiate but also has a limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still above what he's willing to pay. There's a risk that continuing the negotiation could lead to even higher offers from Alice.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
