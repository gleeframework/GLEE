"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however, and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while recognizing the value it brings to your company.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
