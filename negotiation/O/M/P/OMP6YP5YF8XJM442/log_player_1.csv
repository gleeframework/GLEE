Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle on a price higher than John's $8,000 offer.
* **Confidence:** A strong opening offer can signal the product's value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product."
