{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might consider. This allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $17,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $15,500?  It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum price and a reasonable compromise. It's better than selling to John for $15,000.  I'll accept his offer."
