"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm not eager to sell to John for $100, I'd rather keep negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum, but we're getting closer.  It's more important to me to make a deal now, rather than risk losing him entirely.  We're already halfway through the rounds, and I'd rather secure a sale than take the chance of having to sell to John."
