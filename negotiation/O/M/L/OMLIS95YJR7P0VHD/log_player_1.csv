"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a strong opening position.  It leaves room for negotiation, but it also communicates the high value I place on the product.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm confident the product is worth more and want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm not ready to settle for $1,700,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a slightly lower counteroffer than the previous round, showing my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll sell to John. There's a chance I might get more from Bob, but it's getting risky, and I want to secure a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering the price to $1,650,000, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to continue negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
