* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states that I'm open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to respond and keep the conversation going.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response,  remembering that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations stall."
