{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $50,000 discount from the product's value to him, and you make a $150,000 profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties subtly pressures Bob to make a decision without seeming overly aggressive."
