"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $170 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, as I can get it from John for that price.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $145. It's a good middle ground considering its value to you is $120. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
