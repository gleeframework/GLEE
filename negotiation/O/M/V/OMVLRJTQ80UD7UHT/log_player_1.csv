Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed.  I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest with a friendly message."
