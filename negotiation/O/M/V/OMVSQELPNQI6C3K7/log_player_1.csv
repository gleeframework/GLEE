"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture as much of the potential value as possible. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident that Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a significant price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell below my minimum.  There's still time to get a better deal from Bob or go with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this offer is reasonable, considering Bob's initial counteroffer and the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's above my minimum acceptable price and a good compromise.  There's always a risk that Bob might reject my next offer or that John's offer might expire, so it's better to secure a deal now."
