"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  It also gives Alice a chance to meet Bob halfway, potentially finding a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high for Bob, who values the product at $15,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get the price down further.  Continuing the negotiation process might lead to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's moved up from his previous offer of $9,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. However, he's still below Alice's current offer of $10,000, demonstrating that he's not ready to accept a price that's too high. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable price."
