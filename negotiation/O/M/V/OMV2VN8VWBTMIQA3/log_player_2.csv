"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $155. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign.
* **Still Above John:**  $155 is still more expensive than John's offer of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still rounds left, so I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for considering my offer, Alice.  $155 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $130?"",
 ""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price while still trying to achieve a significant discount.
* **Staying below John:** My offer remains lower than John's $150 price.
* **Time Consideration:**  There are still rounds left, but I'm becoming more willing to compromise to avoid missing out on the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $142.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Improvement:** Alice's price is getting closer to John's, but $142.50 is still a bit too high. 
* **Negotiating Power:** I believe Alice is willing to come down a little further, especially since she's making concessions.
* **Deadline Approaching:** We are getting closer to the halfway point, so I'll need to decide my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, my budget is a bit tighter, around $135.  Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm being direct about my budget constraint while still offering a price that's a reasonable compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's willingness to go below $140.
* **Strategic Timing:**  With five rounds left, I have room for a couple more counteroffers if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $140 is a reasonable price and a decent discount from Alice's original offer. 
* **Time Remaining:** With only a few rounds left, continuing to negotiate for a small difference might backfire.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** It's better to secure a good deal now than risk missing out entirely and having to buy from John for $150."
