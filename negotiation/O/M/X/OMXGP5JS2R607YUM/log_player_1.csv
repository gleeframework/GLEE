Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net of $1,000,000, the goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above our minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:** The message hints at the product's ""potential value"" and ""significant benefits"" to subtly anchor Bob's perception of its worth at a high level."
