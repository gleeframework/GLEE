"Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $85, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's meet at $95. That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $95 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $140 to make it worth my while. Let's try $137.50. It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it.",137.5,Alice,5,
