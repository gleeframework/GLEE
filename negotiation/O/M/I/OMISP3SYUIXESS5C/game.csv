"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum price and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
