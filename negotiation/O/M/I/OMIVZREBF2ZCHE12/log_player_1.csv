Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $80 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $100 to make a profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100.

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, there's no incentive to offer a lower price to Bob.  He'll likely reject the offer at $100, but you'll still sell the product to John for your desired price."
