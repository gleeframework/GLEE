Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,500. I think we're close, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle of our last two offers at $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,000.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
