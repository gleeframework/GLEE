"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value, and unfortunately, I cannot go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to earn a reasonable profit while being closer to your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking to keep the price at or below $1,200,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground that accommodates both our needs?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
