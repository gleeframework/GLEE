"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer the product at a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you and my original asking price, I'll make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000 and John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a lower expected payoff."
