"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $825000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
