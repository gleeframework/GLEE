"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a competitive offer considering its potential return on investment.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $720,000? It's a significant step closer to your asking price.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $900,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. If that's not feasible, I might have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $750,000. I need to be fair to myself in this negotiation. My last offer is $825,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",825000.0,Alice,7,
