Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to make you a special offer of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth trying to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for us while still presenting a substantial discount to Bob ($400,000 less than its value to him).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" is a common negotiation tactic to encourage a quicker decision from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  A more aggressive approach might start with a higher price closer to $1,500,000.  However, the chosen strategy balances risk and reward by offering a price enticing to Bob while still securing a significant profit."
