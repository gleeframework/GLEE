Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to maximize my earnings. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm offering a price of $75, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Even though it's a risk, I'm choosing to sell to John for $80.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee that he will come up to a price I'm comfortable with, and I risk losing time and ultimately earning less."
