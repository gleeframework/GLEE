"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to give you a discount for being a valued customer.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $8,500? It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
