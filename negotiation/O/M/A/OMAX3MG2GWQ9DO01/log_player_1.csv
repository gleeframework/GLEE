"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($15,000) and above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price (""great value"") to make it more persuasive.
* **Openness:**  I'm ending with an open question to encourage Bob to respond. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my target with Bob first.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $14,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000,  considering the value I've placed on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum and closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm using language like ""common ground"" to encourage further discussion and a potential agreement. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still prioritizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,200. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $15,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject this offer, I risk going into further rounds of negotiation with no guarantee of a better price. There's also the risk of Bob backing out entirely.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is tempting, it's only $200 higher than Bob's current offer.

Considering the proximity to my target price and the potential risks of further negotiation, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
