"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11500, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $11500, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $12500.  My final offer is $12000, which is my absolute limit. If you can't accept that, I'll have to move on.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 is your absolute limit, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $12750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,
