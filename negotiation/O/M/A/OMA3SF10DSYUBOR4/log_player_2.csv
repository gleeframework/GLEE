"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above my ideal price. Since I have the option of going to John, who is selling for my maximum price, I can leverage that to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counter-offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my ideal. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,100,000 at this point. Since I have the option of buying from John for $1,500,000, I'm in a good position to keep negotiating with Alice. I'll try to lower her price further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000. This is within my budget and is a good deal considering the product's value to me.  While I'd prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or Alice deciding to sell to someone else. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
