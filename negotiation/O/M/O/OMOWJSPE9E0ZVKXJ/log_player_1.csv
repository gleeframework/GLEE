Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for more than $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  A strong initial offer demonstrates your confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your desired price.** While $12,000 is better than your minimum of $10,000, you're aiming for a higher profit. 
* **You can likely get closer to your desired price.** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and you know he values it higher than $12,000.  
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but not the best.** While you'll get $10,000, you could potentially do better with Bob.

**Next Step:**  You should send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for something closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit. It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Potential for agreement:**  This price is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob, making it a possible point of agreement.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** You are trying to achieve a better price than what John is offering.

This counteroffer balances your desire to make a good profit while recognizing that a compromise might be necessary to secure the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffers are getting lower.** His offer is now only $1,500 above your minimum acceptable price. This suggests he's not willing to come up much further.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.**  There's a good chance that more back-and-forth will just lead to a lower price, and you might end up with an even worse outcome.
* **Selling to John guarantees a decent profit.** While it's less than your desired amount, it provides a secure and known outcome.

**Conclusion:**  While it's frustrating to not get your ideal price, it's a good strategy to cut your losses and secure the sale to John. You've achieved a good result, and you haven't risked getting an even lower price from Bob."
