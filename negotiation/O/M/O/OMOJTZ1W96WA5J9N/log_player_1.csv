Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $120, you ""anchor"" the price in Bob's mind at a higher point. Even if he rejects the initial offer, he's more likely to consider a slightly lower counteroffer (e.g., $100) as reasonable.
* **Worst Case Scenario:** If Bob rejects your offer, you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $80, your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
