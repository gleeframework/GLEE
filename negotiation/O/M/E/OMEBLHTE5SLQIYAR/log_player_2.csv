"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $100, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You're guaranteed to get the product for the same price with John, eliminating any risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers or driving the price up."
