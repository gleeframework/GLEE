Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider a price of $775,000, which is still a discount from the original price. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $775,000.  While there are still rounds left for negotiation, the potential gains are getting smaller. Accepting at $775,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice becoming firmer in her stance, or the negotiation breaking down altogether."
