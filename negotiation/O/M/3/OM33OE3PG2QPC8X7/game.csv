"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $910,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps the value of the product for you while also allowing me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",915000.0,Alice,7,
