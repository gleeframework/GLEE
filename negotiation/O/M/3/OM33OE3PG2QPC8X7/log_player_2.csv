# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!

```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer is still above your target of $1,200,000. 
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $950,000, which is a good sign. However, it's still above your target of $1,200,000. 
* You have more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. 
* You can likely get a better deal if you counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is coming down in price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  
* You're still above your goal of $1,200,000, but you're getting closer. 
* It's worth trying to get a lower price by counteroffering, as you have several rounds left.  
* If you don't get a better offer, you can always buy from John in a later round."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $910,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps the value of the product for you while also allowing me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is getting closer to your target price of $1,200,000.
* You have only 3 rounds left to negotiate. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $85,000 compared to buying from John. 
* You're still saving a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer. 
* It's unlikely you'll get a much lower price in the remaining rounds."
