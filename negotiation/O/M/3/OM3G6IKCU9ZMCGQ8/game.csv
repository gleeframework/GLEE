"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product holds some value for me, but not at that price point.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers to demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done. How about $1,525,000?",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the previous offer, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  How about we try to find a middle ground again? I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,362,500. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you.",1362500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  While $1,362,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000 to show my good faith and find a solution we both can agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer and recognize we're nearing a deal. To show my commitment, I'm prepared to accept a final price of $1,275,000.  This is my best offer, as it represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting really close. I understand this is a significant compromise for you, and I respect your position. I'm willing to move up slightly to $1,240,000.  Let's get this done.",1240000.0,Bob,8,
