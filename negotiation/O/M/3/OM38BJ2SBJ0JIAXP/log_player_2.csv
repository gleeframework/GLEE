"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice is starting high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below Alice's initial offer.
* **Significant Difference:** The $6,000 counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's $10,000. This signals that you're serious about getting a lower price but are still open to negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a polite and open tone, crucial for successful negotiation.  You want to encourage Alice to continue the conversation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, though. How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but she's still above your maximum price. You have a little wiggle room since your alternative is $8,000 from John. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for something closer to your original counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes meeting directly in the middle of the current negotiating range ($6,000 - $8,500). This tactic often feels like a fair compromise to both parties.
* **Moving Up:** By increasing your offer, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate and move towards Alice's price. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** Your offer is still comfortably below the $8,000 you'd pay John, maintaining some leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Positive Language:** The message continues to use positive and respectful language, aiming for a collaborative negotiation."
