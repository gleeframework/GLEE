,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $11,250, which is a compromise between our previous discussions.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,875.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a positive outcome.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer for now.",11000.0,Alice,5,
