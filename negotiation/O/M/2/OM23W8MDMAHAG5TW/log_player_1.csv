"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, we can adjust the price downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob while allowing me to secure a higher profit than the minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered $850,000, which is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is closer to my desired price.  I've already had two rounds of negotiation, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a potential sale.  While I can try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a chance that further negotiations could lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and secures the sale."
