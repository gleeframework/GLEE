"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's 20% lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but there's still room for improvement. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $850,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's latest offer. This gives us some wiggle room for a potential deal in the next round."
