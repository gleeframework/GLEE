{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's valuation:**  $110 is more than $80, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're not losing money. 
* **Reasonable:** A $10 difference is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $90, it's better to reject and try to get a higher price.  John is willing to pay $120, so there's still a good chance of getting closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is closer to what I'm able to spend.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my ideal.  I'm going to reject and try to get a bit closer to my target price of $120.  John is a guaranteed sale at that price, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $95 is still not quite working for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
