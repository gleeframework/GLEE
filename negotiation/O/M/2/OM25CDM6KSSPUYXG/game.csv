"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  That way, we both get a fair price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is closer to what I'm able to spend.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $95 is still not quite working for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
