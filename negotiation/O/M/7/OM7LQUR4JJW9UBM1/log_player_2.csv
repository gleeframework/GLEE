Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $100. I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $110, and we have a guaranteed option at $80 with John.  It's better to secure a good deal than risk getting stuck with a higher price or no product at all."
