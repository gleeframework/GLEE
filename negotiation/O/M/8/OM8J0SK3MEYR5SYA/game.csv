"Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $950,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $975,000. If you can't do that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency, and I'm willing to make one last concession. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,037,500. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can reach a deal.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I need to stay firm at $975,000.  If that doesn't work, I wish you the best, but I'll need to consider my other option.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're very interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my own goals. I'm willing to make one last push, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000, but I need a firm commitment from you. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
