"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you and my initial offer. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
