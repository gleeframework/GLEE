"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high asking price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his perspective, making it clear that this is the opening move in a negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  While there's always the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, exploring a potentially more lucrative deal with Bob is strategically advantageous in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's early in the negotiation, so rejecting this lowball offer and presenting a counteroffer is the best strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a more reasonable price point."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Counter:**  It's important to acknowledge Bob's offer to show you're engaged in the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message reiterates that Bob's offer is too low but expresses a willingness to find a ""middle ground."" 
* **Strategic Concession:**  The price reduction is substantial ($300,000) to incentivize Bob but still keeps the offer well above both your minimum and his perceived value.
* **Time Consideration:** There are still several rounds left, allowing for further adjustments if needed. However, moving closer to your own acceptable range is wise as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $900,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Increase:** Bob's offer increased by only $100,000, demonstrating he's not significantly budging yet. 
* **Below Value:** The offer remains substantially below both your minimum acceptable price and Bob's own perceived value of the product.
* **Negotiating Position:** Rejecting shows you're firm on a more reasonable price and encourages Bob to make more substantial moves. 

It's still too early in the negotiation to accept such a low offer. Continuing to counter with a firm stance is the best approach for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we need to find a price point that acknowledges the true value of this product. Let's aim for a more significant move - how about $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Encouragement:**  Starting with a positive note (""appreciate your willingness..."") keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages continued engagement.
* **Addressing the Gap:** The message highlights the need for a larger price jump to bridge the difference in valuation.
* **Strategic Reduction:** Another significant drop of $200,000 signals flexibility but remains above the halfway point between the initial offer and Bob's counter. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** As rounds progress, larger concessions from your side may be necessary to prompt a similar response from Bob and avoid reaching a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute limit of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Bob's ""final offer"" statement is a common negotiation tactic designed to create pressure. It's crucial not to let this sway you prematurely.
* **At Bob's Value:** While Bob has now reached his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** With four rounds remaining, there's still space to negotiate and potentially push Bob slightly beyond his stated ""limit."" 

Rejecting now keeps the possibility of a better offer alive while maintaining your position. You can use the remaining rounds to gauge Bob's true willingness to walk away or to incentivize a move closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you.  While I appreciate you meeting your perceived value, I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budgetary constraints."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding and Acknowledgment:**  The message starts by emphasizing understanding for Bob's position and acknowledging his ""final offer"" statement. This builds rapport and avoids a confrontational tone.
* **Transparency and Justification:** Being transparent about your own minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) can encourage Bob to be more realistic. It also demonstrates that your counteroffer is a genuine attempt to find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Compromise Offer:** Proposing a 50/50 split between Bob's last offer and your target price signifies a willingness to compromise while remaining firm on the value you need.
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, moving more decisively towards a potential agreement is important to avoid missing out on both Bob's offer and the alternative with John."
