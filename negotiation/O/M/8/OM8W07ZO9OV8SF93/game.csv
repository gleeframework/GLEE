"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a more reasonable price point.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $900,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we need to find a price point that acknowledges the true value of this product. Let's aim for a more significant move - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute limit of my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you.  While I appreciate you meeting your perceived value, I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budgetary constraints.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
