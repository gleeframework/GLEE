"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I expect to get from the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $10000 doesn't reflect the true value of this item. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $12500? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $15000, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
