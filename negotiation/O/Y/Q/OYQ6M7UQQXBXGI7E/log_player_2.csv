# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its unique benefits. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $10000 doesn't reflect the true value of this item. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $12500? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
