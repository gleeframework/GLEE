"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's full value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
