Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, $100. This is the price John is willing to pay, so I have a safety net. If Bob accepts, great! If he doesn't, I can always go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll try to get closer to that with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise that's closer to my ideal price, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go that high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $95, $90 is still a decent price, especially since John is offering $100. There's no guarantee that Bob will offer more in the next round, and it's not worth risking the sale for $5 more."
