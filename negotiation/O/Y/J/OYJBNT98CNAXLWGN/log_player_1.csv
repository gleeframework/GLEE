Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe its value is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Value-based language:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counter-offer, giving you further insight into his valuation.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could test different starting prices and messaging approaches to see what yields the best results."
