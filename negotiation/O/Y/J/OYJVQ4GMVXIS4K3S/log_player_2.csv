"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about purchasing the product while also trying to secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price closer to his maximum budget of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I appreciate the offer, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings while still being within a reasonable range for Alice. The counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer but still below his maximum budget. The message emphasizes that this is Bob's final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to accept or risk losing the deal. The mention of the alternative offer from John ($8,000) strengthens Bob's bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your willingness to pay $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000, saving him $1,250 compared to accepting Alice's final offer."
