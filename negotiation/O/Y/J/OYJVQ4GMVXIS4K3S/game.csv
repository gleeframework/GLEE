"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. While I appreciate the offer, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your willingness to pay $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",9250.0,Alice,5,
