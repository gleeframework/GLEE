Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer because it is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,500. This reflects a significant discount and is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better compromise.  However, I am mindful of the time constraint and will consider selling to John if the negotiations don't progress quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $7,250 is still below my desired price point.  How about we settle on $8,000?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product while still giving you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
