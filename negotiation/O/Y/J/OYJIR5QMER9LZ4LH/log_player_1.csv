Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher allows for the possibility of maximizing your profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $149 is perceived as significantly lower than $150, making it more appealing to Bob.

This strategy attempts to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
