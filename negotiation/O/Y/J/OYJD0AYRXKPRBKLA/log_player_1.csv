"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $10,500 is still too low for me, and I have a few rounds to work with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $11,000. How about $10,800? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,600, which is a good compromise. This way we both get a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting closer, $10,600 is still below my desired price. I'm going to try to push for a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,600 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $10,700.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're close, but I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $10,650. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting close to my minimum price, and with only a few rounds left, it's time to take the deal.  $10,650 is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
