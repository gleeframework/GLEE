"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $1,800,000. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is coming down, but we're still far from a desirable outcome. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is our final offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and demonstrating that we're serious about a higher price. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We're showing flexibility by coming down from our initial offer, but not by a significant amount. This keeps us in a strong negotiating position. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are mindful of the limited rounds and want to push Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is tempting, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. Bob's willingness to meet halfway suggests he has more room to negotiate.  We'll continue to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's wrap this up.  How about $1,575,000, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1575000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're again demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but this time with a much smaller concession.  This shows we're serious about closing the deal at this price point.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By using phrasing like ""let's wrap this up"" we're aiming for a quick close to the negotiation.
* **Strong Position:** We're still significantly above John's offer, giving us a buffer should Bob counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. I hope we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could likely push Bob a little further, the potential gains are getting smaller with each round. The difference between his offer and our desired price is now relatively small. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or us running out of rounds. Accepting his offer guarantees a very good profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to use the $1,550,000 for other opportunities rather than dragging out the negotiation."
