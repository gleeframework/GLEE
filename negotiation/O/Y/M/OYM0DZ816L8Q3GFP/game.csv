"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  I've had other interested parties and I need to see a price that reflects the true potential here. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This would still be a great deal for you in the long run.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm not interested in paying above my budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for this product. This is a substantial amount, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,100,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, but we're still a bit apart. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still outside of what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This price would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
