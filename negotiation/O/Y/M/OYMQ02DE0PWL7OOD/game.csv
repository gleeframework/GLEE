"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm confident this product offers even greater value. How about we settle at $1,120,000? This represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of this unique opportunity.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,120,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,100,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but it seems we're at an impasse. I need you to be serious about this deal. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not ready to move forward at that price, I need to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,025,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
