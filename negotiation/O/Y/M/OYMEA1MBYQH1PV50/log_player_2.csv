Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer it to you for $140, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll really appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $140. Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but the guaranteed savings of buying from John outweigh the potential benefit of a final counter-offer."
