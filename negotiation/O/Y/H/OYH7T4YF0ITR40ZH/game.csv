"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $12000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $17000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the potential value this product holds.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is my absolute limit.  This would still allow you to make a profit while providing me with a product I'm interested in.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14000 is still below my minimum.  Given the potential value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15500. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm prepared to pay $15000 for this product, which is my absolute limit.  It's a fair price for both of us: I get the product I need, and you still get a good return on your investment.  Let's make this deal happen.",15000.0,Bob,6,
