Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

This would still allow you to make a profit while providing me with a product I'm interested in.  Let's see if we can make this work.
