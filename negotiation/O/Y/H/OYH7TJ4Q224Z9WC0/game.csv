"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10750.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $10750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower. I'm prepared to offer $10600 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate further, and I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to your target. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10700.
