"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $500000 is a bit low for the value this product offers, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $750000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your constraints.  $600000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit low for the value this product holds. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $700000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $650000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $675000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget.
