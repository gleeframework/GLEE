"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice, it's still over Bob's budget.  He should see if he can get a better price in the following rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $825,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's a good deal for him, considering his budget and the fact that he can still save $50,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer in the next round, and he might end up having to buy from John. It's better to secure this deal now while he has a good price and plenty of rounds left."
