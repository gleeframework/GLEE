"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,125.  This is a very fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",11125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,125 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,200. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,150 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to make one more small concession, and I'm counteroffering at $11,175. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1175.0,Alice,9,
