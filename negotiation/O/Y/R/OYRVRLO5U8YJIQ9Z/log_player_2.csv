"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is above your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds and Alice is likely willing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:** If negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John, although at a higher price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?

* **More negotiation is possible:**  You have 7 rounds left and Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is still an option:** It's a safety net if this negotiation falls apart, but it's not your preferred outcome."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

* **More negotiation is possible:** You have 5 rounds remaining and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is still a backup:**  If the negotiation fails, you can purchase from John, but it's less ideal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,125.  This is a very fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 11125}
