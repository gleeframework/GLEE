""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 (John's offer) as possible while ensuring Bob is still interested.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to price it higher than that to make a profit but low enough to entice him.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency that might push Bob to act quickly. 

By offering the product at $1,400,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the value difference between what Bob is willing to pay and John's guaranteed offer."
