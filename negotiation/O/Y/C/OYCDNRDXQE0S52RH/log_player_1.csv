I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but also allows for some wiggle room in case he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is too low for me.  While I would be happy to sell to him at a price closer to $14,000, I'm not willing to drop down to $13,500. I will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This is still a good price for both of us and shows my willingness to negotiate. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low for me, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating. The risk of continuing and getting an even lower offer is not worth it, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
