Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value.  Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 diminishes your potential gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It emphasizes exclusivity and value, framing the offer positively for Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit margin while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain of $50,000 compared to his valuation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob is somewhat negotiable.  If you anticipate aggressive bargaining, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship Building:**  A positive and collaborative tone in your message can go a long way, even in a negotiation.
