Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is not moving significantly towards a reasonable price point. She seems stuck between $900,000 and $1,100,000. It's time to show I'm serious about my budget and willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I see your position hasn't changed much. I'm serious about buying this product, but only within my budget.  My final offer is $700,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firm but fair:** This message conveys a sense of urgency and finality while remaining respectful.  
* **Clear ultimatum:** By stating this is a ""final offer"" and mentioning ""other options,"" we signal we're willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Strategic increase:** The price increase to $700,000 shows we're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost. 

This approach aims to either secure a reasonable deal with Alice or allow us to move on to John's offer before wasting more time."
