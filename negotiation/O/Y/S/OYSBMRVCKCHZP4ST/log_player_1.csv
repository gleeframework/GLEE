Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,800,000 is a good deal, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground by lowering my offer slightly, but still remaining above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe in the product's value."

```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's last offer, but I'm staying close to my minimum. I'm hoping that this shows Bob I'm serious about finding a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1800000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,825,000 for this product. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1825000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal. However, I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept my offer in this round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that this is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1750000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I've been negotiating for a while, and it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that meets my needs. With only a couple of rounds left, I don't have time to keep pushing for a higher price. It's better to sell to John for $1,500,000 than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
