"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has a clear upper limit of $150, and Alice's product is worth less to her than the price she is offering.  This creates room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to accept $110?  I'm serious about buying, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $120? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.  At $120, Bob is still saving $30 compared to John's price, and the negotiation seems to be moving in a favorable direction.  There's a good chance he can get a better deal in the next round, but there's also a chance Alice will become less flexible.  Accepting the offer at this point minimizes risk and secures a good price."
