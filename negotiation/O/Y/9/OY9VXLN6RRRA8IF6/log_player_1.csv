"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit.  A starting point closer to Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer will help gauge Bob's enthusiasm. A quick acceptance means I might have gone lower, while a counteroffer will give me more information about his willingness to pay.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives me leverage and a safety net. I won't accept any offer below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure the best possible deal, accepting such a low offer would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter in the next round with a price closer to his valuation but still well above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by a significant amount ($50,000) to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and meet him partway.
* **Staying Firm:** However, the new price is still substantially higher than his offer and well above my guaranteed sale price with John. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without conceding too much too early.
* **Time Consideration:**  We still have several rounds, so there's no need to rush into accepting a low offer. I'm confident that with strategic negotiation, I can secure a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $900,000. My maximum budget remains at $750,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has now repeated the same offer twice, indicating he may be unwilling to budge from his $750,000 limit. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not increasing his offer. Each round spent on a potentially fruitless negotiation is a round I can't use to explore other opportunities or refine my sales strategy for other potential buyers.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's standing offer of $800,000 ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

While there's a chance Bob might eventually increase his offer, it's a risk I'm not willing to take at this point.  Accepting John's offer ensures a solid profit and allows me to move forward with the sale."
