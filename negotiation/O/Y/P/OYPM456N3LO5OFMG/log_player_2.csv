{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to go lower, and I want to maximize my savings."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but also wanting to get the best possible deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a tempting price, I'm still aiming to save more. There are 7 rounds left and Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows that I'm taking Alice's offer seriously but still believe there's room for compromise. I'm hoping to find a middle ground in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is closer to my target price.  While I could continue to try and negotiate further, we are only halfway through the rounds.  There's a chance we might not reach an agreement before I have to buy from John.  Accepting this offer saves me $375,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a good deal overall."
