Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $9,500, which I think is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $500 profit. It's time to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed sale with John."
