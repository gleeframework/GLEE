"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, Alice.  While that's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend, I could go up to $9,800.  Do you think that would work?",9800.0,Bob,4,
