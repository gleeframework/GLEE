"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures I get the product sold and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
