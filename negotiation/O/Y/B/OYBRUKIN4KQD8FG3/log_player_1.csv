{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a significantly larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is strategically chosen:
    * It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it a very attractive offer.
    * It leaves a substantial profit margin for you ( $350,000 more than selling to John).
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Framing the offer as exclusive adds a sense of urgency and value. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
