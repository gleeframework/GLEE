Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning  ""its value,"" Alice hints at the product's worth without explicitly stating a number, leaving room for Bob to perceive a value potentially even higher than $16,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly reminds Bob that Alice has other options if he declines the offer, creating a sense of urgency.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Alice gets a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Alice has room to lower the price slightly while still making a profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice can sell to John at her minimum price, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
