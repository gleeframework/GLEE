"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
