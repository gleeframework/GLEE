{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get the product for as close to my $800,000 limit as possible."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get the product for less than $800,000.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, I will try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still below my limit. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice."

Alice's offer is now at my maximum limit.  It makes sense to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
