{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting offer. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but also significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$60 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $90?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I could do $75, would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not a profitable deal for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $85.  This is a fair price that gives you a great product and allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
