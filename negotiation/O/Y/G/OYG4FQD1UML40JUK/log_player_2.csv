"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice's offer is too high ($120). We can try to negotiate a lower price or buy it from John for $80. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's initial price ($120). This gives us room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere.  
* **Target Price in Mind:** We know our absolute limit is $80 (John's price). By offering $60, we aim to potentially secure a price even lower than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $90?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:While Alice's offer of $90 is better, it's still a bit higher than our ideal price. We're close to John's price, so we can try to negotiate further or go with John.  
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I could do $75, would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Offering $75 is a reasonable compromise between our initial offer ($60) and Alice's counteroffer ($90).
* **Staying Below John's Price:** This offer ensures we're still getting a better deal than buying from John ($80).
* **Maintaining Communication:** We keep the negotiation open and express continued interest in finding a price that works for both sides."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $85.  This is a fair price that gives you a great product and allows me to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

```tool_code
Reason:Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and we know we can get the product for $80 from John. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and save the extra $5.
