Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $120 is my minimum, but I believe the product is worth more.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $120 is really my bottom line. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $150.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $130 is better than my minimum and selling to John. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
