"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 14000. How about we meet in the middle at 16000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the product's value, $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $15000, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 15000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 17000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,5,
