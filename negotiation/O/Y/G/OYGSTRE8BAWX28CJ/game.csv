"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? That's still a fair price for a product you value at $15,000. Let's make this deal happen!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
