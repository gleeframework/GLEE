Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to Alice. This is her ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000 if Bob declines.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best strategy is to offer the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This maximizes her potential profit while still ensuring Bob sees value in the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm prepared to offer it at a price that reflects its significance. How does $795,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 795000
}
```

**Why This Works**

* **Profit Maximization:** This price nets Alice a significant profit while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Psychological Edge:** Offering a specific, slightly odd number like $795,000 can make it seem like a more carefully considered and thus appealing price.
* **Time Value:** While Alice could theoretically push Bob closer to his maximum, a faster sale to Bob might be preferable to a slightly higher offer from John later on.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer, but this strategy gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit while still ensuring a sale."
