{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point,  aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price.  It allows room for negotiation while still setting a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm really only looking to spend $80 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95,  which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 95}
