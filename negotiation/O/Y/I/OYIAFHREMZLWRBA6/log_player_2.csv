"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  You can use this to your advantage in the counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm really only looking to spend $80 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95,  which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down to $95, which is still more than you are willing to pay.  Since you can buy the product from John for $80, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
