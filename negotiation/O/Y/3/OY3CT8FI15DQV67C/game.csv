"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $795,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair price considering our negotiation so far. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this negotiation is proving fruitful and we're getting close.  How about we settle on $775,000 and call it a deal?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make another slight adjustment and offer you the product for $790,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",790000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're really in the home stretch now.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Do you think you can agree to $782,500?",782500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $782,500. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer you the product for $788,000.
