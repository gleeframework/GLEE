Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves a decent margin for Bob while still giving me a healthy profit above my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm confident I can negotiate further with Bob to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, but it's still a better deal for me than selling to John, and I think it's a fair price for Bob, considering his willingness to pay $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm comfortable with $105. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
