"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000. I'll need to see Bob's reaction to this offer to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept it at this point.  I'll try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I have more rounds to go, and I'm not willing to settle for less than I think the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000.  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $16,500 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000 and still leaves room for some profit. With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal to John or Bob completely."
