"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
