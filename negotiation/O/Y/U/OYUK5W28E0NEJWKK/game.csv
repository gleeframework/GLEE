"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. My initial offer for the product is $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $120 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go down to $70, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $80, but I'll throw in some extras that will make it worth your while. Let me know if this is a deal you'd be interested in.",80.0,Alice,5,
