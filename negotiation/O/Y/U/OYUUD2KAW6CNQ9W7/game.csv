"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I respect your position, but that price doesn't reflect the value I'm offering.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to accept $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at this point.",975000.0,Bob,6,
