"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?  That would be a significant savings for me, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.",13250.0,Alice,5,
