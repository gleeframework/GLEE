It's too early to accept such a low price. Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."

Round 2

Let's start with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  This will gauge her interest and see if we can find a middle ground."

Alice is moving slowly, but I think we can still get a better price. Let's try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 6

Alice is not budging on her price, and we've already made several counteroffers.  It's getting late in the game, and I'm not willing to risk going another round with her without knowing her minimum. It's time to move on and accept John's offer."
