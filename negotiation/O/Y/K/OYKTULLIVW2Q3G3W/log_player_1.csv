Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $10000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $7500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's a good starting point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $7,500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,750? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8750}
