"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm offering $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is taking a significant chunk off my initial asking price, reflecting my desire to see this deal through. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $9,500. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.",9500.0,Bob,4,
