"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for as little as possible, ideally under $8,000. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is way too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm offering $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is taking a significant chunk off my initial asking price, reflecting my desire to see this deal through. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  He can make another counteroffer or, if he feels he won't get a lower price from Alice, he can always purchase from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $9,500. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 9500}
