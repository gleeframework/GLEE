"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm offering $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is taking a significant chunk off my initial asking price, reflecting my desire to see this deal through. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $9,500. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting his offer of $9,500 means losing out on a potential $500 profit compared to selling to John. While continuing negotiations is possible, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of Bob not increasing his offer substantially."
