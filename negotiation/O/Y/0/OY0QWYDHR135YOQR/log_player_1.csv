Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,500,000, hoping to maximize my potential earnings.  This leaves room for negotiation, but still positions me above my minimum acceptable value.  I'll be ready to counter Bob's offers strategically, while keeping the option to sell to John as a fallback if the negotiation goes poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable value.  While I could accept and secure a sale, it would be a major loss for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  

I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer that reflects my value for the product while still being open to a compromise.  I'll also keep the option to sell to John in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but shows a willingness to compromise. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value and the price John is offering.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes risk. I'm going to accept his offer and move forward."
