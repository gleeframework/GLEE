"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll see if he bites. If he rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $750,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
