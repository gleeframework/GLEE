"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you need to bring the price down significantly.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be open to considering a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $8000, which would be $10000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will refuse any further counteroffers, and you might end up with no product at all. Since John is willing to sell the product for your target price of $8,000, it's the safest and most financially sensible option to buy from him."
