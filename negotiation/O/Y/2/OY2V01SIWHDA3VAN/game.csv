"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $180 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really appreciate it. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $140 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $120. I'm really interested in this product and hope we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. Let's try $132. It's a fair price for a high-quality product like this, and I think you'll be happy with it.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $132 is still a bit too high for me. How about $125? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make at least $135 to make this deal worthwhile.",135.0,Alice,7,
