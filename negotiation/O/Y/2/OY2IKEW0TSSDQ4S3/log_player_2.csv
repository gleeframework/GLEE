"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I believe it's only fair to present it to you at $140. This offer is tailored to reflect both the product's worth and your perceived valuation. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.**  You'd pay $140 from Alice versus $150 from John. 
* **You can still save money compared to your maximum budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is lower."
