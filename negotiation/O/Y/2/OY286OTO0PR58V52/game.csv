"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussion.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the value you're getting while still being a fair deal for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your counteroffer doesn't reflect the significant value this product offers.  I have other interested buyers, but I believe in being straightforward and giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,025,000.  This is a firm price, and I need a decision soon.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
