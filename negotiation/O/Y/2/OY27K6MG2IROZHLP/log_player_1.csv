{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000 or more in the right hands. I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows us to be ambitious.
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a price of $1,750,000 allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a significant profit above our minimum.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value exceeding even Bob's valuation, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, given the potential for a substantial gain, it's a calculated risk worth taking in this scenario."
