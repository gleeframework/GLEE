""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position and allows her to be more assertive in her pricing with Bob."
