"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Even though Bob's offer is at the lower end of my preferred range, it's still a good deal for me. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, and Bob's offer is the same. Since I want to close the deal as quickly as possible, I'll accept Bob's offer."
