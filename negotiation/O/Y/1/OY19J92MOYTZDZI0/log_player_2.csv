Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you have a budget to stick to, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to $930,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

It's tempting to push for a slightly lower price, but Alice has been firm and is unlikely to go much lower.  $930,000 is a reasonable price and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer."
