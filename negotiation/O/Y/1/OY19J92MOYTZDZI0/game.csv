"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I can meet you in the middle at $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight discount to $950,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to.  If you're willing to agree to $920,000, I can close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I think I'll need to explore other options.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you have a budget to stick to, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to $930,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,7,
