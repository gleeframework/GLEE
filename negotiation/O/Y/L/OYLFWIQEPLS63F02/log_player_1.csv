I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him while still being profitable for me."
