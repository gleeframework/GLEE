"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly higher than what I believe Bob might be willing to pay ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention that the product is ""perfect"" for Bob, suggesting its value to him.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($150) and even lower than what the product is worth to him ($120). 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is an option, I want to see if I can squeeze a better deal out of Bob before resorting to that.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, keeping in mind Bob's budget constraints and the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $120 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  It's still a great price for a product you'll enjoy!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I reiterate that the product is worth the price and that Bob will be happy with it.
* **Emphasize Deal:** I'm positioning $140 as a good deal for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to find a middle ground. If Bob accepts, it's a win for me. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer again in the next round based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would $130 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum ($150), it's still below what I'm comfortable with.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already in Round 4, so I need to be careful not to lose too much time.

**Strategy:**

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to increase the price slightly. I'll need to be strategic about my offer and consider the remaining rounds to maximize my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go down to $135.  It's a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm offering another compromise price, increasing slightly from Bob's offer but still below my initial desired price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement by saying ""let's seal the deal!"" 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, ensuring both of us get what we want. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move, aiming to close the deal while still ensuring a decent profit.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to evaluate the remaining rounds and possibly consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We're at a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $130, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $135. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're in Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds.  The likelihood of Bob changing his mind is slim.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150. 

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get $135 from Bob, it's better to guarantee a profit than risk losing more time and ending up with a lower price. Selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
