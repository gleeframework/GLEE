I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000, $10,750 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by pushing for a higher price."
