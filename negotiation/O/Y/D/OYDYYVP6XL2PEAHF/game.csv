"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $750,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $750,000. How about we meet at $725,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Would you be willing to go up to $740,000? It's just a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",740000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $740,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $725,000, so how about we try $732,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a reasonable compromise.",732500.0,Bob,6,
