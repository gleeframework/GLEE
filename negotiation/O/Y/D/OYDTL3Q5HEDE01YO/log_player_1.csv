"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Showing confidence:** My message conveys that I believe in the value of the product and am not afraid to ask for a good price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, implying I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with maintaining the possibility of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is interested in the product and has shown willingness to pay a significant amount. This makes it worth continuing the negotiation. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering and exploring other options. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle for $135? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial prices.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's uniqueness to justify the price.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I frame the price as a ""fair"" compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation going while gradually increasing the price towards my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we agree on $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We are already in round 4, and there is a chance Bob might get even lower in the next round. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Selling to John guarantees a sale, but it's at a lower price than what Bob is offering. 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
