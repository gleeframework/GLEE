"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this product for a price that represents a significant value proposition for both of us. I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let's discuss a price point that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is only slightly better than John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much. 
* Alice is motivated to sell and might make a counter-offer closer to her product's value of $800,000. 

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation. There's a chance Alice won't budge and you'll have to settle for John's offer. However, the potential savings make a rejection worthwhile."
