"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?  This would be a good starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying at this stage.  I want to see if I can get her closer to my desired price point before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation.  To be frank, $975,000 is quite close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her to budge. If not, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your flexibility.  However,  I'm still hoping to reach an agreement closer to $975,000. Would you be willing to consider $985,000? This is the very best I can do, and it would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 985000}
