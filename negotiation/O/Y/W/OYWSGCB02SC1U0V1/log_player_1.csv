"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,000 is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,250 is closer to my goal, I'm still confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.  I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,250 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go down to $9,750.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I'm willing to budge a little bit more. How about $9,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering we've only got four rounds left.  There's a chance I might not be able to get a higher offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk selling to John for less."
