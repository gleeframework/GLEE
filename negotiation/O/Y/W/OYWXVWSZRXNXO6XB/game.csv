"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects the value it holds for me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will add significant value to the product. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000, but I think this is a fair price considering the added value",1150000.0,Alice,5,
