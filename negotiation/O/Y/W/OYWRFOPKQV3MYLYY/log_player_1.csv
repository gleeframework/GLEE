Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more involved in the process. 
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and potential return on investment for Bob helps justify the high price tag.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so you're not desperate. This knowledge empowers you to negotiate confidently."
