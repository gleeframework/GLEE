Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you are subtly reminding Bob that it's worth a significant amount, even if you don't explicitly state your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning that you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply that Bob might lose out on a good deal if he doesn't accept your offer. This creates a bit of urgency.

While there's a chance Bob might reject $10,000, it's a calculated risk. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
