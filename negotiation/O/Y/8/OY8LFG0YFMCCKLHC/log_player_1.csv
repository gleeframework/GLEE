Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring the deal is still appealing to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer. 

By offering the product at $1,100,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
