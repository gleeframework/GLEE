"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $20,000 is closer to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? This is my final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,000, and it's her final offer.  You can get it for your target price from John."
