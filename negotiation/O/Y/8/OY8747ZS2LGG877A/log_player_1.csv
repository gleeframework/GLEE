Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price significantly lower than my minimum while still being enticing. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still ensures I make a significant profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
