"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That would give us a good deal and allow us to finalize this transaction. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,
