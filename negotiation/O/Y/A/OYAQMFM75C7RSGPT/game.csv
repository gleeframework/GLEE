"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This represents a considerable discount for you while still ensuring a fair return for me.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
