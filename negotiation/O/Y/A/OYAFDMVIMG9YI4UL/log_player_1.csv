"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the negotiations so far and the value I see in the product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,010,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. I'll meet you at $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
