"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential.  Let's discuss further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Rationale:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, reflecting the value I place on the product.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Reserve:**  I'm keeping in mind the $1,000,000 floor from John's offer, leaving room to potentially lower my price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1400000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my floor price, it's still significantly below my initial asking price. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing the price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding ""Sell to John"":**  Selling to John right now would be leaving money on the table, as there's still a possibility of getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Counter with a Justification:**  I'm not just lowering my price, I'm giving a reason:  a desire for a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" and acknowledging the product's unique value.
* **Moderate Adjustment:**  The counteroffer is a compromise, suggesting flexibility while still being above Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within my strategic range and not giving away too much."
