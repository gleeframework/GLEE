"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'll sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is lower than your maximum price, you can try to get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. She might come back with a counter-offer closer to her $80 value. If not, you can always buy from John for $120."
