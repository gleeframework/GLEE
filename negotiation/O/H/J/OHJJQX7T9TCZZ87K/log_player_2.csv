"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to push for a price closer to your $10,500 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about $10,750?  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $10,875? This is a good compromise and a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price of $10,500, and it's worth considering the potential risks of continuing to negotiate. 

* **Risk of Alice walking away:** If you keep rejecting her offers, there's a chance she might get frustrated and decide not to sell to you.
* **Risk of time:**  The more rounds you negotiate, the more time you'll spend on the process. This could be valuable time you could be spending elsewhere.

While $10,875 isn't ideal, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids potential risks."
