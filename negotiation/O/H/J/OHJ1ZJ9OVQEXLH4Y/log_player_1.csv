"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need you to come down significantly. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be a fair starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more reasonable offer from Bob.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value to you, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I can move a little on my previous offer, how about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting a bit ridiculous.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm afraid I have a firm budget. My final offer is $785,000.  Take it or leave it.

It's getting late in the negotiation process, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not sure I can get a better deal with Bob, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
