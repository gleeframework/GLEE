"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 is really too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it still allows me to make a profit.",130.0,Alice,5,
