Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is too low. I should try to negotiate a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $7,000 is still quite low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500,  but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget.  I can stretch to $7,500, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.
