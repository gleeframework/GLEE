"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, which is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings to you, and I believe you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be open to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",975000.0,Bob,6,
