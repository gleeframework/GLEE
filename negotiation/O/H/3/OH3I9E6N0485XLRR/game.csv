"I understand you think $18,000 is too high, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is my final offer for now.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet somewhere in the middle again, say around $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $10,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. This is my final offer for now.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.  How about we settle at $9,000 even? That's my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I can do $11,000, which is still a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,7,
