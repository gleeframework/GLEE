"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's no reason to accept it.  You should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a starting point closer to your target price.
* **Psychology:**  By offering such a low price, you signal that you are a serious buyer but not willing to overpay. This might encourage Alice to reconsider her position and make a more reasonable counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Alice's Reaction:** Be prepared for Alice to reject this counter-offer outright. It's a bold move, but it could pay off.
* **Alternative:** You always have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $18,000 is too high, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down significantly, $12,000 is still much higher than John's $8,000 offer.  There's room to negotiate further, especially since Alice said this is her ""final offer *for now*."" That suggests she might be willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet somewhere in the middle again, say around $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This counter-offer aims to split the difference between her latest offer ($12,000) and your previous offer ($6,000). This tactic often feels reasonable to both parties in a negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $8,500 is slightly above John's offer, signaling to Alice that you are serious about buying from her but also have an alternative option. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time:** Each round increases the risk that Alice might lose patience.
* **Walk Away Point:** Keep John's offer in mind. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in the next round, it might be time to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $10,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a significant markup from John's offer.  While there's always a risk Alice will walk away, there's also a good chance she'll drop her price further to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $10,500 is still a bit too high.  How about we settle at $9,000 even? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer splits the difference again ($10,500 vs. $8,500) showing willingness to compromise, but the ""final offer"" language sets a firm boundary.
* **Above John, Below Alice:**  $9,000 is still a better deal for Alice than losing the sale, and it gives you some savings compared to John while avoiding further haggling.
* **Time Factor:**  By now, you've established a pattern of negotiation.  Ending it decisively with a reasonable, yet firm, offer might be the nudge Alice needs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I can do $11,000, which is still a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not significantly budging on her price. It seems unlikely she'll come down to a figure you'd prefer, and you've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  At this point, the potential savings from further haggling with Alice aren't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed deal with John."
