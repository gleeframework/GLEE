"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on the product and what I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
