"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $110. I think it's a great deal, as I know it's quite valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $105 is a good price for him, given that he's willing to pay up to $120. It's also a fair compromise from Alice's previous offer."
