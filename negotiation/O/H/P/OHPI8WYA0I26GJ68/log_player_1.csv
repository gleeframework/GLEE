Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal. This means starting above his perceived value but not so high that he walks away instantly.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,350,000 is above Bob's valuation, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob why he's interested.
* **Open to Negotiation:** ""I believe this is a fair price...""  and ""Let me know your thoughts"" signal your willingness to discuss.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While you have John as a backup, don't use him as a threat. This can make negotiations adversarial."
