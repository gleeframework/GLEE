"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get this deal done. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11500, which would be $10750. Can you consider this price?",10750.0,Bob,6,
