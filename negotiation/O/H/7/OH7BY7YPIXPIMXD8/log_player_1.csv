""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John who will buy it for $10,000, ensuring we don't go below our minimum.

By offering the product at $14,000, we are:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might try to negotiate down, but we have some buffer before hitting our minimum.
* **Capturing most of the surplus value:** We are getting $4,000 more than our minimum and leaving Bob with $1,000 of perceived value."
