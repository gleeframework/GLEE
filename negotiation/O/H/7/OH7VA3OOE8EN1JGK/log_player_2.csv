"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Reason:  While Alice's offer is only $1 more than John's price, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a better price.  It's wiser to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
