Send your offer to Bob.","```json

This offer is a starting point that reflects a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start high and see how Bob reacts."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm not willing to sell to John at this point, as I'm confident I can secure a higher offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal. It's a significant profit for me and I'm running out of time.  It's time to close the deal and secure this profit."
