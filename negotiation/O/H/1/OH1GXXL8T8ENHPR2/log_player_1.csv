Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can haggle you down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that it's worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrases ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

**Important Note:** While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially maximize your profit."
