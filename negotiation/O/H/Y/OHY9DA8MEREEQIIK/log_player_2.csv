Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings!

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $110 is still significantly higher than her value and our target price. We can risk another counteroffer to try and get closer to $90."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer, though. How about we meet at $105? It's a small step back from $110, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $105 is within our acceptable price range. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
