"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that you'll find this to be a fair starting point for negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I can do $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to consider offers in that range. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it represents a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
