"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. This unique item is priced at $950,000, which I believe represents an excellent balance between its worth and the investment you're making. I understand the significance of this product to you and assure you that it is well worth the investment. Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but still above your ideal price.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and  $950,000 is still higher than your ideal price point.
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you signal to Alice that you are serious about getting a better deal.  She might be willing to counter-offer a lower price to avoid losing the sale to John."
