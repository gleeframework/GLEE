# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower offer, as it's in her best interest to sell the product for more than its value to her ($800,000)."
