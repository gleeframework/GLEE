Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  This initial offer is bold, but I'm confident that I can still get a good price. I also need to factor in that John will buy the product for $1,500,000."

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still potentially do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to a compromise. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal."

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is getting close to my minimum and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
