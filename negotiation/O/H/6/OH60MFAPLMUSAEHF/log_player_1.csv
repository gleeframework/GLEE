"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting high ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Gauging Bob's enthusiasm:**  This offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase. His response will give me insight into his perceived value and negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't proceed favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my initial ask. While it's still a profitable price, I believe there's room for negotiation to secure a better deal. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm not ready to accept his first counteroffer or resort to John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a suitable investment level. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer.  Could you consider $1,225,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference (almost):** My counteroffer  meets Bob halfway between his offer ($1,100,000) and my previous asking price ($1,300,000) with a slight lean towards my side.
* **Show flexibility, maintain value:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but holding firm that the product is worth a premium price. 
* **Leaving room for a final push:** This counteroffer still gives me some wiggle room to go down slightly if Bob counters again, while keeping the deal very profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal and would like to counter with a price of $1,175,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Strong profit margin:**  This price still nets me a profit of $375,000, which is considerably more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. 
* **Time value of money:**  Prolonging negotiations further might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
