Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly. 
* **John as a Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, so there's no pressure to go below that.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
