Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Bob knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, so he has some room to negotiate upwards, but my initial offer pushes him towards accepting a price closer to my desired range.  Let's see what he proposes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,550,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a decent profit margin for me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's clear we're not going to agree. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a decent deal and guarantees me a sale."
