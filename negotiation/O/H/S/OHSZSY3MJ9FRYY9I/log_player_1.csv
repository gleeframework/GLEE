Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point as it gives me the chance to earn more than my minimum while still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good deal for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $125. This is a compromise that is closer to my desired price while still being a reasonable offer for Bob. I'm hoping to meet in the middle and come to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $110.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and I'm worried that if I reject this offer, he'll go with John's offer of $100. I'm better off taking the slightly lower price than risking losing the deal entirely."
