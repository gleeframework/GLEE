It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $120 is still too high, but you can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $100 for the product. This is a reasonable price that is still below my maximum budget, and leaves some room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Alice has come down to $115, which is within my budget and a good price considering John's price of $150. Accepting her offer is the best option in this round."
