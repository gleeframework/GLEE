I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $155, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $150 and Bob's offer of $140. This shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145

```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'm not confident we can reach a price that works for both of us, so I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John."
