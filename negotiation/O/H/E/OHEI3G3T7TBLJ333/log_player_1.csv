Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I won't settle for anything less than $140."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than $140. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $120? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 120}
