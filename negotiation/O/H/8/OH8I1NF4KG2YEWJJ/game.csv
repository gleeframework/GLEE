"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $1,100,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price reflects my maximum spending limit while still recognizing the product's worth. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but the reality is this product has a very high floor for me. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 - this is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
