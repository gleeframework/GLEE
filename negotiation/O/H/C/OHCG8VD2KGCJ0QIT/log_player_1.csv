Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price, considering it's still a good deal for you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:

Bob is inching up, and we're still significantly above John's offer.  It's worth pushing a bit more to see if we can get closer to $11,000."
