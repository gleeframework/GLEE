Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you halfway at $10,000, but I'm not going any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for her minimum price. It's the same price as John's, and there's no guarantee we can get it lower with further negotiation. Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price."
