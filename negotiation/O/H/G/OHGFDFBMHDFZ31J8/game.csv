"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
