"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.
