"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I can go at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
