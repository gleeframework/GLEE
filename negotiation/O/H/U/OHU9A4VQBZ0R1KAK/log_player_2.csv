"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $10,800, which is closer to Bob's ideal price point of $10,500. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,200 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of Alice walking away increases."
