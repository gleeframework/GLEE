"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
