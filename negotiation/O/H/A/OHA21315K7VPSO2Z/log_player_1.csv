Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. 
* This price is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still higher than Bob's value of $8,000. 
* This creates a potential win-win scenario:
    * I earn $1,000 less than my ideal price but avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John at $15,000.
    * Bob gets a good deal, paying $6,000 less than my minimum price and $6,000 more than his perceived value. 

This approach aims to maximize my chances of a successful sale while still securing a decent profit."
