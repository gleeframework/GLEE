Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. This is because I want to maximize my profit, and Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I can always adjust the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to meet him halfway.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but it's still not satisfactory. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll see if I can push him further in the next round."

I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous counteroffer and Bob's last offer. This is a final attempt to get a price that is closer to my desired value while still showing flexibility. If Bob rejects again, I will accept John's offer and sell for $10,000."
