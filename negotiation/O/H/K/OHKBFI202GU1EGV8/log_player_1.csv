Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I'm aiming high because I don't know Bob's valuation. If he's willing to pay more than my minimum, I'll make a larger profit. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. This means there's no downside to aiming for a higher price with Bob. 

This strategy balances the need for a high profit with the security of a fallback option."
