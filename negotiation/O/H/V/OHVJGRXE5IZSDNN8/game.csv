"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground.  I can't go as low as $7,750, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can come.  Let's make this happen!",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the price I was originally considering from John. Can you meet me there?",8000.0,Bob,6,
