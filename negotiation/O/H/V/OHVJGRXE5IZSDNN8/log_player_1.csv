"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I also need to consider the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come up a little more.  I'm also factoring in the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for the $10,000 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground.  I can't go as low as $7,750, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can come.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the price I was originally considering from John. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I would like to get closer to my target, it's a good deal considering the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer or walking away entirely.  I also need to consider the time factor, as the negotiation is getting close to the 10-round limit.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale, and I can always try to negotiate a higher price with John if this deal falls through."
