"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
