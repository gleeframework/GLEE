Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $7,500?

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $9,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  My final offer is $8,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum valuation of the product at $8,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better offer. Selling to John for $10,000 is the optimal choice to maximize profit."
