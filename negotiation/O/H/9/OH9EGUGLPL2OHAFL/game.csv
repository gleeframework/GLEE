"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price considering it's the beginning of our negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's aim for $775,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can do $750,000.  That's the best I can offer, but it's a very fair price for this product.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $762,500. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else. Let me know your decision.",762500.0,Alice,7,
