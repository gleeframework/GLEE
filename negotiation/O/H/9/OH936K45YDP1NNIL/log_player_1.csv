Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $9,000 is still a bit high.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  I'm ready to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,750 is a good compromise and is closer to my desired price than selling to John. It's worth closing the deal now and avoiding further negotiation."
