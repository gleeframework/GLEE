Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so you're not desperate. This strong fallback position lets you be firm in your negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust the price downwards, especially if it means securing a deal and avoiding the potential time and effort of selling to John."
