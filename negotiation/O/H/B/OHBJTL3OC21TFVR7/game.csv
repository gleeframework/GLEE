"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I can get the product elsewhere for $10,000.  Would you be willing to match that price? It would save us both time and effort.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",10800.0,Alice,5,
