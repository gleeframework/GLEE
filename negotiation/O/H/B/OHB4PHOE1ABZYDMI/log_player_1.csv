Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and professional tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which might make him more inclined to accept a higher price. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better Than John:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my initial proposal, it's still higher than what John is offering. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to try for a higher price. 
* **Value Justification:** I want to see if Bob is willing to come up from his offer, given the product's value to him.  

**Next Step:** I'll counter with a price higher than $850,000 but lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This represents a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you, and allows me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the previous offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Value Reminder:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the value of the product to him.
* **Negotiation Continuation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, but also signaling that I'm serious about getting close to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I still believe the product is worth less than $900,000 to me. I would like to propose a price of $875,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 lower than what I could get from John. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might result in a higher price, but there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids further negotiation time. 

This decision balances maximizing my profit with the risk of losing the deal completely."
