"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This represents a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you, and allows me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I still believe the product is worth less than $900,000 to me. I would like to propose a price of $875,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",875000.0,Bob,4,
