"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to you, accepting Alice's offer or buying from John both result in the same outcome. However, you are trying to save as much money as possible. You haven't been given any information that would make Alice a better option than John. Therefore, the most logical choice is to buy from John."
