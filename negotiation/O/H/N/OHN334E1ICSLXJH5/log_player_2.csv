"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his target price without being too aggressive.  $85 represents a good compromise while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $87.50, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is still a good deal for Bob. He has a maximum budget of $100, and buying from John would cost him $100. While it's possible to continue negotiating, the time constraint (only 10 rounds) makes it risky. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a decent price before Bob runs out of time or John's offer expires."
