Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. It also opens the communication with a positive and friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay up to $10000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. It's still a great price for you considering the value you get. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. It's also closer to my desired price, and I'm hopeful he'll accept this offer."
