"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 simply wouldn't cover what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's too high. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
