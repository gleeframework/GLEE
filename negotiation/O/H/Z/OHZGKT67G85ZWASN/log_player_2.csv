Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that considers both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, saving you $50,000. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice when you have a guaranteed better deal elsewhere."
