"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, as I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This price reflects the unique benefits this product offers, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still outside of my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1125000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value of the product.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
