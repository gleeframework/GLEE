Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential desire for the product and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I hope this counteroffer is enticing enough for Bob to consider, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal considering the possibility of him rejecting my next counteroffer and leaving me with only John's offer of $1,000,000. I'm going to accept his offer and secure a decent sale."
