"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a better price. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $900,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
