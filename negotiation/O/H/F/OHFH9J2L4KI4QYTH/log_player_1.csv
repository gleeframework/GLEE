"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value I place on the product. It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer in the first round, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I believe I can do better. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since I have 8 more rounds to go. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob while still allowing me to secure a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal. We're already halfway through the rounds, and it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.  The potential for a better deal isn't worth risking ending up with only John's offer of $1,000,000."
