"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the opportunity, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and the market value, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is too far below what I can accept. This product offers significant value that I believe you're undervaluing. Would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a willingness to meet you closer to your price while still acknowledging the true worth of what's on offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which represents a substantial investment on my part. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise that considers both our needs. Let's work towards an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
