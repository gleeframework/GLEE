"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and still well above what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.
