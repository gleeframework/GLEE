"Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a competitive price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product that's worth $15,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
