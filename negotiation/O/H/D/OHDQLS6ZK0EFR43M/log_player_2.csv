"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our high-value product to you. Given its significant worth to you, we propose an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  It's likely there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's worthwhile to continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $850,000."
