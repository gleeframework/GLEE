"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This price provides a buffer for negotiation while still remaining significantly above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly reinforcing the price justification."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Could you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,050,000 is above our absolute minimum, it's significantly lower than both our opening offer and Bob's perceived value of the product. Accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  We still have 8 rounds left, giving us ample opportunity to negotiate a better price.
* **Alternative Exists:** We have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations deteriorate.

**Next Step:** We will counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to bring Bob closer to a more agreeable price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider $1,300,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We are reducing our price by $100,000, which shows flexibility but maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to move closer to our desired price range.  
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value to justify the price without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet halfway at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:** Bob is moving closer to our range, but $1,175,000 is still significantly less than our target. 
* **Negotiating Tactics:**  Bob's ""meet halfway"" approach is a common tactic. While it sounds fair, we have made a more substantial concession in the previous round.  
* **Time Advantage:** We still have six rounds left.  Continuing the negotiation keeps the pressure on Bob to improve his offer further.

**Next Step:** We'll counter with a smaller price reduction in Round 5, signaling we are approaching our limit while still incentivizing Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair and final offer, reflecting the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our price by $50,000, a smaller amount than before, signaling we are nearing our bottom line.
* **""Fair and Final"" Tactic:** Using this language adds weight to our offer and might encourage Bob to take it seriously. 
* **Staying Above Target:** We're still aiming for a price well above our absolute minimum and significantly closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  I'm ready to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit margin, well above our minimum and a good outcome for our negotiation.
* **Bob's Signaling:**  Bob's language (""ready to close"") and price increase indicate he is serious about closing the deal.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to squeeze a bit more in further rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
