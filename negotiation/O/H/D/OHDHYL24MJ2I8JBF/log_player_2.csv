"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's always better to try to get a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his $10,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still $1,500 above his target price. There's still room for negotiation, and he might be able to get a better deal in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still $750 above Bob's target price.  It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a better result for Bob.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, securing the best price available and avoiding further negotiation."
