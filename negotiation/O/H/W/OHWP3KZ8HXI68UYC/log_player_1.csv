Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant profit for me, as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. However, it's also a price that still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, considering he values the product at $15,000.  

By offering a price that's not the absolute maximum, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher final price. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $12,000, but it's still a substantial profit for me and it's likely more attractive to Bob than his last offer of $9,500. I'm hoping this will lead to a swift agreement and avoid further back and forth.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still prepared to accept his counteroffer if it's closer to my desired price, otherwise I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stuck to his offer of $9,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me considering my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation.  This ensures I don't risk losing out on a sale by being too stubborn."
