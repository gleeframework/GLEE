"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a middle ground and close this negotiation.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
