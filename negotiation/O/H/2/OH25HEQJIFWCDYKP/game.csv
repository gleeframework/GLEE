"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider a price of $1750000?  It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understanding.  While $1600000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1700000.  This would allow me to make this deal work for both of us.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1650000? ",1650000.0,Alice,5,
