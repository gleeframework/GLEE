"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $2,000,000. It's a steal, considering its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a great opportunity for Bob, emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message also implies I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for counteroffers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Explore Potential Higher Value:**  I might be able to secure a better price through further negotiation.
* **Test Bob's Interest:**  Seeing how much Bob is willing to increase his offer will give me a better understanding of his true value for the product.

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider a price of $1,750,000?  It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway, suggesting a price that's still significantly higher than my minimum but represents a considerable discount from my initial offer.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reiterating the ""great value"" of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth and potentially pushing him to consider a higher offer.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by suggesting a price instead of stating a firm ultimatum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. Would you consider $1600000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Continue Negotiation:**  I can explore if there's more room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Avoid Settling Too Early:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to settle for a price that's too low just yet.

I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, keeping in mind Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understanding.  While $1,600,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,700,000.  This would allow me to make this deal work for both of us.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,650,000? "", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway again. 
* **Highlight Shared Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""both of us"" aspect, reminding Bob that a successful negotiation benefits both parties.
* **Specific Offer:**  I'm making a concrete offer of $1,650,000, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I'm proposing $1550000 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not ready to settle. Here's why:

* **Time is on my side:** I have 4 rounds left. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly if I hold firm.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option. However, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,600,000.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to meet you halfway once again.  Would you consider a price of $1,600,000? This would allow us to close the deal and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway again, despite his lower offer.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the ""mutually beneficial outcome"" to incentivize Bob to agree and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Finality:** While I'm open to a compromise, I'm making it clear that this is a final offer, pushing Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I propose a final offer of $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a critical moment. While Bob's final offer matches my minimum acceptable value, I have only two rounds left.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a high chance that Bob won't budge further. Pushing for a higher price could result in losing the deal entirely. 
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit. 

With limited time and the risk of getting nothing, it's more strategic to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
