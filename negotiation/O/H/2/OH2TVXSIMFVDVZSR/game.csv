"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",800000.0,Bob,4,
