Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I still think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm getting a bit impatient. This is my last offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has become inflexible and is unlikely to budge from her $1,050,000 price. She's even introduced time pressure. While you could likely negotiate her down a little further, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of her walking away. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees you get the product and caps your losses, which is preferable at this point."
