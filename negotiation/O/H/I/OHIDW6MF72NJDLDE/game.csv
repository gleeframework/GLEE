"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $10,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
