Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I know it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  I want to pique his interest without appearing overly aggressive. 
* **This strategy balances:**
    * **Maximizing profit:** I'm aiming for a high initial price.
    * **Avoiding immediate rejection:** The offer is still within Bob's perceived value range, increasing the chances of acceptance.
    * **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob might counter, allowing for a potential higher final price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that just yet. 

* **Bob's offer is low:**  He's offering my minimum price, which leaves no room for profit.
* **I have leverage:**  I know the product is worth more to Bob, and he's already expressed interest. 
* **Negotiation is key:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to find a price that's more favorable to me.  I'll aim to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This way, we both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm not giving away the product at my minimum price just yet. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust again, but I'm confident this offer is more attractive than selling to John for $10,000. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,025. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,025
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $10,250 is still significantly higher than selling to John. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob has shown he's willing to walk away. If I reject his offer, he might decide to go with someone else, and I'd be left with only the $10,000 option.
* **Small but significant gain:** $10,250 is only $250 less than my initial counteroffer, and $250 is better than nothing. 
* **Potential for future collaboration:**  Even though the negotiation was a bit tense, building a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's close to my minimum acceptable price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
