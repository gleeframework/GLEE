{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $120 to Bob.  Alice's offer of $65 is a good deal, but Bob can likely do better. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $50 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $65,  while still leaving room for negotiation. This offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining a competitive price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to get the best possible price.  While Alice's offer of $60 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still believes he can get it for less. This counteroffer of $55 shows Bob's continued willingness to negotiate and could potentially sway Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's price is still higher than Bob's ideal.  While $62 is a bit better than her previous offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth continuing to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 58}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but he's still trying to get the best deal.  This counteroffer of $58 shows Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway, but also shows that he's not willing to pay her full asking price. With only four rounds left, Bob needs to find a price that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $64. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $64
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a higher price than her initial offer. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price.  It's more efficient and time-saving for Bob to purchase the product from John for $120 to avoid further negotiation."
