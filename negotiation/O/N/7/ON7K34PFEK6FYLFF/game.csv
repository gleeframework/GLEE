"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is a bit expensive, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

"I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement at a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial deal. Considering your previous offers and my minimum value, I'm counteroffering at $1090000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, but I need to be honest with you, Bob - if I don't get this price, I'll have to explore other options, including selling the product to another buyer.
