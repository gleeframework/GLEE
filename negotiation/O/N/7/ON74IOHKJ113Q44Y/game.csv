"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9500 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but no more. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $10250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
