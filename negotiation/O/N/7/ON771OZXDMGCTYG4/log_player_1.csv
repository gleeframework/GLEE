"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob,  $9,500 is a good starting point. It's also well above my minimum of $8,000. I want to see if he's willing to pay close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $8,500, which is still above my minimum and closer to Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm getting closer to the $8,000 mark where I'd rather sell to John, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $8,200.  This is getting close to my minimum, but I still want to see if I can convince Bob to pay a little more.  If he rejects this offer, I'm likely going to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still not high enough. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with him. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000, which is a safe and secure deal."
