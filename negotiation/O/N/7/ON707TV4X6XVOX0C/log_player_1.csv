Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000, making it potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Strategy:** 
    * This initial offer leaves room for negotiation.
    * If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in my counteroffer.
    * If negotiations stall, I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? That's a significant discount for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This is a compromise price, meeting halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the compromise and the value for Bob.
* **Strategy:**
    * This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
    * It increases the chances of a deal without sacrificing too much from my desired price. 
    * If Bob rejects again, I can lower my offer slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum value, it's getting closer.  Negotiating further might take more time, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away altogether.  At this point, it's better to accept his offer and secure a sale. The potential loss of $550,000 is less risky than the possibility of losing the deal entirely and having to start over with another buyer."
