Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, you've got a negotiation going.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the security of John's offer ($150). This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate a better price from Bob. By rejecting and countering, you signal that your initial price wasn't arbitrary and you're looking for a value closer to your initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, the product is worth significantly more to me than $150.  Could you meet me halfway at $175?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You're showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from your initial price.
* **Targeting Above Your Minimum:** You're aiming for $175, which is still a profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  You've given a reason for your position (""worth significantly more to me"") without revealing your absolute bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $160 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $160 is above your minimum acceptable price of $150, securing you a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now means you complete the sale and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations for a marginally better outcome."
