 Alice's offer is too high. It's worth going through a round of counteroffers to see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

While $155 is closer to my limit, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to keep negotiating and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $152. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While $152 is closer to my limit, it's still above my initial goal of $120. There's a chance that I could continue negotiating and get Alice down to my target price, but I don't want to risk it. John is offering a guaranteed price that works for me, so I'm going to go with that option."
