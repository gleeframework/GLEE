"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $787,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",787500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $787,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers, and I'll sell the product to you for $816,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",816250.0,Alice,7,
