"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This price is still above what I could get from another seller, so it reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product from you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the unique advantages it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its value while still offering you a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  To show my continued interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, while remaining within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
