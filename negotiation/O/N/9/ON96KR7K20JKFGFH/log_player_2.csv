However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the unique advantages it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its value while still offering you a good deal.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm confident we can find a more mutually beneficial price point.  I'll counteroffer again."

I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
