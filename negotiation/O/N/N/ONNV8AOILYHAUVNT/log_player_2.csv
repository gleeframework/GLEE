It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a lower price than buying from John."

I'm offering $85, which is still a good deal for Alice as it's more than what she values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $86 is a good deal for me, as it's less than what I'm willing to pay. It's also close to my last counteroffer, so further negotiation might not be worthwhile."
