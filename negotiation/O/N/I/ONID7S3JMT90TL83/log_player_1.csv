{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation. I'm not giving it away for my minimum price, but I'm also not starting with the highest price possible. It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $132.50 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $129. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $129 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling it at that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $129 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet at $131? That's only $1.50 more than your offer and closer to where I need to be. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 131} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $128? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is only offering $128, which is still below my minimum price of $150. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not sure how much more room there is for negotiation. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
