"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $132.50 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $129. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",129.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $129 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet at $131? That's only $1.50 more than your offer and closer to where I need to be. What do you say?",131.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $128? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",128.0,Bob,6,
