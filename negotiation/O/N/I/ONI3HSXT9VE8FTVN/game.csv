"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is worth $8,000 to you, and I am willing to pay up to that amount. Could we perhaps come to an agreement closer to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to reach a good selling point. Let me know what you think!",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I would like to stick closer to my original offer of $7,500. This price aligns better with the value I see in the product. Can we find a compromise that works for both of us?",7500.0,Bob,4,
