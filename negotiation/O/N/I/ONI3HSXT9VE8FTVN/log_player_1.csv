{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to part with it for a bit more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is worth $8,000 to you, and I am willing to pay up to that amount. Could we perhaps come to an agreement closer to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is still a good deal, I can likely get closer to my target of $8,000. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than his."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to reach a good selling point. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I would like to stick closer to my original offer of $7,500. This price aligns better with the value I see in the product. Can we find a compromise that works for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is insistent on his price, and it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement closer to my target of $8,000. Since John is willing to pay $8,000, I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation."
