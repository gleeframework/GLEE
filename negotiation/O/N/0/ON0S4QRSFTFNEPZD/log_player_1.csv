Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob away. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $130 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my initial offer and is significantly better than selling to John for $100. I'm also running out of rounds, so it's in my best interest to close the deal now."
