"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500? This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
