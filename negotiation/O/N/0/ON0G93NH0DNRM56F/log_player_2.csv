{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and a fair reflection of its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is quite a bit below my initial ask. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $2,000,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,850,000? It's a fair compromise and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
