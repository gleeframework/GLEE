"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,350,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $1,310,000. I think that's a fair price and allows us both to benefit.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,320,000, which is just $10,000 more than my previous offer. I'm not sure I can go any lower than this, so I hope you can meet me here.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
