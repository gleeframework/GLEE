# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,320,000, which is just $10,000 more than my previous offer.

Alice has become firmer on her price and is only budging slightly now.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,320,000. Accepting the offer guarantees a good price without the risk of her backing out or running out of rounds."
