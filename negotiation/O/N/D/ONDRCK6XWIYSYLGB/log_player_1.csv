"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price. To begin negotiations, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to anchor his perception at a higher point than his initial assessment. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the initial price is high, it's crucial to remember I have a guaranteed offer from John. This knowledge allows me to negotiate confidently and walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing I have John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's actual value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show flexibility. However, the new price is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum and allows room for further negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, aiming to nudge Bob's perception closer to the higher end of the spectrum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By making a significant move, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate but also establishing a firm position. This hopefully encourages Bob to respond with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob has increased his offer, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if a reasonable compromise can't be reached. I'm confident that with John's offer as a safety net, I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I need you to understand that this product holds significant value, and I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I need a decision from you on this."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm making it clear that I'm nearing my limit.  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" (even if not explicitly John) reinforces that I have alternatives.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm applying pressure for Bob to respond seriously. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've come down slightly from $1,900,000 to $1,600,000. This shows some flexibility but keeps the price firmly above my absolute minimum.
* **Call to Action:** Demanding a decision pushes Bob to consider the offer seriously and not just continue with low counteroffers."
