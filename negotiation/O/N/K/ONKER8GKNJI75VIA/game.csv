"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1100000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my valuation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1090000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1090000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1090000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to secure a slightly lower price. I'd like to offer $1070000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value to me, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement at this point. ",1070000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a slightly lower price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1080000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm proposing a new price of $1080000, with a small sweetener: I'll throw in a complimentary service package worth $20000. This package will enhance the product's value to you and make it an even more attractive investment. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
