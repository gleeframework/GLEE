"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if that works for you!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's a price that I think is fair considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can make it work!",14000.0,Alice,5,
