Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible. While I think the product is great, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
