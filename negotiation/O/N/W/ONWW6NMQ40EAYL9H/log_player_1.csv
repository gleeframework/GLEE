Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob before selling to John."

Round 3

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better offer. It's worth pushing for a higher price with Bob before selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're attached to the price of $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so how about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

$975,000 is close to my minimum, but I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm willing to risk another round with Bob and see if I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $990,000.  It's just a small step further, and it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 990000}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

Although $980,000 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time. It's better to sell to John and get my guaranteed $1,000,000 than risk another round and potentially lose out on a better deal."
