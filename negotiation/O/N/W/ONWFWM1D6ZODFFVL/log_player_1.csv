Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't sell for less.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he won't pay more.
* **Negotiation space:**  There's a $5,000 difference between our valuations.
* **Initial offer:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate, but it's still within my acceptable range.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **John's offer:** I have a backup option with John, which allows me to end negotiations with Bob if I believe I can't get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's higher than his initial valuation, it's still too low for me.
* **My valuation:** I value the product at $15,000, and I'm unwilling to settle for a price that's much lower than that.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $15,000, which is a much more attractive price than Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my valuation.  
* **John's offer:**  I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous offer:** My last offer was $14,000. Bob rejected it and counter-offered $11,000. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm trying to find a middle ground by reducing my offer to $13,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a profit margin.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While $13,000 is less than John's offer, it's still a good price for me. I'm willing to risk losing out on the extra $2,000 if I believe Bob is willing to negotiate further. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I'll have made a good profit, despite some negotiation.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider his next offer and John's offer before making a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still $3,000 less than my minimum valuation.
* **My valuation:** I value the product at $15,000, and I'm unwilling to settle for a price that's significantly lower than that. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed option to sell to John for $15,000, which is a much more attractive price than Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Selling to John:**  Considering Bob's counteroffers, it seems unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a price that's close to my valuation.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible decision to ensure a good profit."
