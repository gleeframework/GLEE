"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. He has a higher maximum budget than Alice's minimum, leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's minimum value but still within his budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that benefits both parties. It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is now within Bob's desired price range and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or the deal falling apart altogether outweighs the potential for an even lower price."
