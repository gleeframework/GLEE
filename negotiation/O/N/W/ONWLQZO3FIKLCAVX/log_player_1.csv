Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is strategically priced:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).** This ensures you're making a profit and won't settle for less than what the product is worth to you.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value ($1,200,000).** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept.

By offering a price slightly higher than your minimum, you're signaling that you're serious about selling but are also willing to negotiate. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the initial offer while still leaving room for a potential counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and below your ideal selling price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to maintain leverage and potentially secure a better price in the next round. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're not desperate to sell at his price. This puts pressure on Bob to increase his offer. In the next round, you can propose a counteroffer closer to your initial price, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.  If the negotiations stall or you feel Bob won't budge, you can always switch to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a profit margin.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still high enough to incentivize Bob to increase his offer again. This strategy aims to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
