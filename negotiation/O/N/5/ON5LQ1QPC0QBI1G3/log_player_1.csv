Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to negotiate, potentially leading to a price we both find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly to $105.  This is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to negotiate further, I'm running the risk of going back and forth endlessly. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
