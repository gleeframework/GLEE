"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
