"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $110 is a reasonable counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is still a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer.  $115 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.  This could encourage Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might get frustrated and either refuse to negotiate further or even increase her price again.  Accepting the offer at $130 is a good compromise, saving Bob $20 compared to buying from John."
