"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that is more than what the product is worth to me, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see Bob's initial reaction and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's previous offer. I want to see if I can close the deal with a price closer to my initial goal without jeopardizing the sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better price.  There's still a chance I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this shows Bob my commitment to reaching a deal, while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to start bridging the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $880,000 is close to what the product is worth to Bob, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. We've only got a few rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can make one last counteroffer to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $980,000. This is a big compromise on my part, but it's still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer.  It's a risky move, but I believe this is the best chance to close the deal and avoid selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob unwilling to budge much further, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it's becoming clear that I won't be able to do so with Bob. Selling to John ensures I get a guaranteed profit, and avoids the risk of ending the negotiation with nothing."
