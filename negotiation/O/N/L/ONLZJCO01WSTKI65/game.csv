"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a fair price considering I value it at $12,000 and you're getting a decent profit.  Let's work towards a deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a good compromise. Let's find common ground and get this deal done.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm going to go up to $13,750. It's a fair offer considering your profit margin and my budget. Let's close the deal!",13750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're in a bit of a loop here. I'm willing to make one final compromise at $14,000. I think this is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,9,
