Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.  By offering it at $14,000, Alice captures a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($1,000). 
* **Avoid Risk:** Offering it for more (e.g., $14,500) risks Bob rejecting the offer and forcing Alice to accept the lower price from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale goes through."
