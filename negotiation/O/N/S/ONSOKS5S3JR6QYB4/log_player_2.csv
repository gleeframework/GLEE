"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's opening offer is already a good deal, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a great deal.
* **Polite and Engaged:**  I want to maintain a positive tone and show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate, which is good. While $125 is a decent price, I think there's still a chance to get it lower.  I'll counter with an offer closer to her price to signal I'm serious but still want a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Alice's price, showing her I'm willing to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $115 is a strong offer - it's a significant saving for me, but it's likely still profitable for Alice. 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and collaborative to encourage a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I think $120 would be a reasonable price for both of us. It's still above your initial offer, but it's also below my original proposal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $120 is a solid price for the product. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a good compromise.
* **Time Investment:**  We've gone back and forth a few times. While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate might mean missing out on this price if Alice decides to hold firm.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
