"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $100 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $75 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll accept $85. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
