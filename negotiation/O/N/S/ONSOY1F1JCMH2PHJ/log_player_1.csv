"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum, knowing that I have the option of selling to John for $150. I'm also trying to be friendly and open the negotiation in a positive way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is far below my minimum acceptable price, and even though I have limited rounds, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm still above my minimum price of $150, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $100 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is still too low for me, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $75 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll accept $85. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm feeling a little pressured by the limited rounds, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm hoping that offering a ""split the difference"" solution will appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
