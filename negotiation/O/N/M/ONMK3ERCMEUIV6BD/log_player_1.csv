"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $12,000 and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely by continuing to counteroffer."
