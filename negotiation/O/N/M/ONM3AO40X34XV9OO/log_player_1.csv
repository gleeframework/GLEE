"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm position. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The price of $2,250,000 is a starting point to gauge Bob's flexibility. His response will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 provides a safety net. I'm not pressured to make drastic concessions early on.

Let's see how Bob responds to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. I need to counter with a price that encourages more realistic negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but that offer is significantly below the product's worth to both of us. To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously.
* **Above Minimum:** The new price is still well above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Signaling Value:**  By staying firm above Bob's offer, I'm reiterating the product's significant value. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this revised offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. I can go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is slowly increasing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John Option Remains:** I'm comfortable rejecting this offer because I have the security of selling to John at my desired price.
* **Time to Push:** I need to signal more strongly that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't reach a more reasonable agreement. Bob needs to make a more significant jump to keep me engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm committed to finding a fair deal, I also have other interested buyers.  To move this forward, I need to see a more serious offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but this is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and putting the negotiation back in Bob's court. 
* **Smaller Concession:** The decrease from $1,900,000 to $1,700,000 is smaller this time, signaling I'm reaching my limit.
* **Mentioning Other Buyers:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that he's not my only option, strengthening my negotiating position.

This is a pivotal moment in the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds to this ""final offer"" tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $1,700,000 is still far too high for me.  My final offer is $1,100,000. If you can't accept that, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is sticking to his ""final offer"" tactic, and we're still far apart.  His incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer.
* **Time Cost:** We've used six rounds, and continuing might yield minimal returns. The longer this drags on, the higher the opportunity cost.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John presents a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum price. It's time to secure a profitable outcome rather than risk a lower offer from Bob or a drawn-out negotiation.

While there's always a chance Bob might have counteroffered higher, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. It's in my best interest to sell the product to John and move forward."
