"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit low for you, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
