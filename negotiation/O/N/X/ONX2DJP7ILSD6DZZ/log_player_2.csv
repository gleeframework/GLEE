"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my initial price to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This accounts for some of your concerns while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a good price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Time is valuable though, and I need to finalize this sale soon. My final offer is $1,090,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, it's getting late in the game.  Bob has already rejected multiple offers and there's a risk that Alice might not budge further.

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Alice to raise the price again. It's a safer option to secure the product without exceeding his budget."
