Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,200,000 (your ""reservation price"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 from John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that is appealing to Bob but also maximizes your potential profit. Here's the thinking:

1. **Don't be greedy:**  While you could aim for a price close to $1,500,000, it leaves Bob with very little incentive to choose you over potentially shopping around more.
2. **Offer a fair deal:** Aim for a price that gives Bob a significant discount compared to his perceived value, while still netting you a substantial profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident this offer represents a fantastic deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's friendly, emphasizes value for Bob, and encourages a response.
* **The Price: $1,350,000**  This price point accomplishes the following:
    * **Profitable for you:** You earn a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
    * **Attractive to Bob:** He saves $150,000 from his perceived value.
    * **Room for negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, you have some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,350,000. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the deal to John's guaranteed offer."
