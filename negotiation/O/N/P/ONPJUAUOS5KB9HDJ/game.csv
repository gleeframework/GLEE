"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'd be willing to pay that much for it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $825,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $787,500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $787,500 is still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
