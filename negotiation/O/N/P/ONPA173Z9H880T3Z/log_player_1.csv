Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Offer above Bob's value:** Offering $12,000 is still above what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **Below my minimum:** The price is below my minimum value of $15,000, but still allows me to make a profit.
* **Consider John's offer:**  By offering a price lower than John's, I'm increasing the chances of Bob accepting and avoiding potential lost profit if Bob rejects. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
