"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1300000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still above your target price of $1,200,000, but it's lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price point. It's also lower than the price John is offering.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product for a price that's still within your budget and saves you money compared to buying from John."
