Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
