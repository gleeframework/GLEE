"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $11500 is a good one, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12800. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $12200, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd love to find a mutually beneficial price for this product.",12200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $12200, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12600.0,Alice,5,
