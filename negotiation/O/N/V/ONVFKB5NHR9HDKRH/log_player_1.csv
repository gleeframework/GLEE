Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob.** This increases the chances of him accepting. 
* **I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000.** This is my safety net, ensuring I'll make a profit even if Bob declines. 

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value and highlighting the benefits for him, I aim to maximize my earnings while still creating a potentially appealing offer."
