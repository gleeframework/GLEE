"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort towards a compromise. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I'd ideally like to get the product for $1,000,000, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Accepting at $1,050,000 still saves me $450,000 compared to John's offer, and further haggling might lead to an impasse."
