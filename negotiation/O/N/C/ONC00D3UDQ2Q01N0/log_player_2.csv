"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are aiming to buy significantly below Alice's value to maximize our potential savings. Starting with a lower counter-offer gives us room to negotiate up towards a price that works for both of us while still staying well below our $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to a more reasonable price, $85 is still above her value for the product. We can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle on $75?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're inching our offer up while still staying below Alice's $80 value point. This gradual increase shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to go to $75, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $82.50? It's a compromise, but it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to get as close to her original offer as possible. While $82.50 is better, we are still aiming for a price closer to $75.  We have rounds to spare, so continuing to negotiate is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  To meet you halfway, how about $78?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the later rounds of negotiation. Offering $78 is a slight increase from our previous offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.  By stating it's our ""final offer"", we add a bit of pressure and encourage Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $78 is a fair price. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. How about $82? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm near her bottom line. While we could likely push for a dollar or two less, we risk losing the deal altogether. At this point, $82 is a reasonable compromise â€“ we're well below our $100 maximum and getting the product for less than Alice values it."
