``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage a positive response."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal,  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
