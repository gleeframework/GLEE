"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'm not willing to go above that.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
