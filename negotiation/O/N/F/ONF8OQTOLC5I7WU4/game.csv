"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm trying to be fair. I'm willing to go down to $98. That's a good price for both of us, and it's just a couple of dollars away from your last offer. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $92 is just a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to compromise, though. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen!",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, I've already offered $92, and I'm not willing to go above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $93?",93.0,Bob,8,
