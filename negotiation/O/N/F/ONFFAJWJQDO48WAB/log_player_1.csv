"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still being a profitable margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, especially since I know John is willing to pay $100. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's still a good deal for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob than $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping for a better deal and I have a few rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I still want to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
