"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for you, considering its potential worth. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  Let's start with a strong offer and see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential value you see in this product. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:** This counteroffer represents a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $950,000 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, suggesting there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob's message highlights the value he recognizes in the product but also emphasizes his financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still significantly below the value I believe this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue exploring a better deal without committing to a price that's still higher than his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to meet halfway, suggesting a genuine desire for a deal. 
* **Staying Above Alice's Minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still comfortably above Alice's minimum acceptable price, making it a plausible offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to consider the proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of this product for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $1,050,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  The difference is small enough to be considered acceptable.
* **Risk of Escalation:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to more rounds of negotiation, potentially raising the price again. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming more risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer guarantees a deal at a price that's significantly better than buying from John."
