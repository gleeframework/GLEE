"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Considering its true worth and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $120. This price reflects its superior quality and the value it can bring to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you can get the product for $20 less from John. Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that."
