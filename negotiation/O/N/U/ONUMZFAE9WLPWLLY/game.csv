"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  $8,000 is quite low, considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to go up to $9,000.  That feels like a fair offer considering the value it would have for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,000 is still too low.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
