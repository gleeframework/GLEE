Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $8,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  $8,000 is quite low, considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
