"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. You should try to negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening counteroffer in a negotiation. It leaves room to negotiate upwards while signaling that you're serious about buying but not at an inflated price. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. If she's willing to come down significantly, it might be worth continuing the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you can always buy from John for $10,000. This acts as your ""walk-away"" point in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  $8,000 is quite low, considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved from her initial offer, $12,000 is still $2,000 more than you want to spend and $2,000 more than John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice reducing her price suggests she's willing to negotiate. There's a good chance of getting closer to your target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to go up to $9,000.  That feels like a fair offer considering the value it would have for me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer to show Alice you're serious about buying but remaining firm below your $10,000 limit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning your perceived value again, you reinforce that you're not trying to lowball her but rather reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Pressure:** By Round 4, you're applying some pressure. Alice knows you have the option to buy from John, and each round brings you closer to potentially taking that deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,000 is still too low.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $11,000 is her ""final offer."" This signals that she is unlikely to go any lower.
* **Above Budget:** Even with her final offer, the price is still $1,000 more than you are willing to pay and more than John's offer.
* **Time to Walk Away:** You've negotiated fairly and tried to reach a mutually agreeable price, but Alice is unwilling to meet your needs. It's time to exercise your option to buy from John at your target price."
