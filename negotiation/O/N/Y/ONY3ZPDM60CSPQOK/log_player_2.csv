"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your limit:** You're willing to pay $12,000, but Alice is asking for $11,500.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a lower price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing you can get it from John for $12,000 gives you leverage to push for a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target:** You're aiming for $12,000 or less, and $11,000 is still above that.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left, so you can continue trying to get a lower price.
* **John is a backup:** Having John as an option gives you leverage to push for a better price from Alice.

It's better to continue negotiating rather than accepting an offer that's still higher than your goal. You might be able to get closer to your ideal price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is maxed out at $10,800.  If you're willing to meet me halfway there, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $10,900. Let's close this deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is $10,900. 
* **You've already negotiated a good price:**  You've managed to bring the price down from $11,500 to $10,900, which is a significant savings. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting impatient or changing her mind. 

While you could try for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids risking losing the deal altogether."
