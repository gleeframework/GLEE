Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This will help ensure Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer and that we can engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is above Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm proposing a price closer to my minimum, but still allowing for some negotiation.  Hopefully, this will entice Bob to make a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 isn't my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and closer to my desired range. There's a good chance Bob won't go higher, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing him altogether.  It's better to secure the sale now and move on."
