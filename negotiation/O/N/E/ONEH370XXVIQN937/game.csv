"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
