Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still ensures Alice a significant profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Offering it for $8,000 would guarantee a sale, but Alice would be leaving $2,000 on the table. By aiming higher, she increases her potential profit.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
