"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about we meet at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair compromise considering your initial offer.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
