{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still getting a decent profit. 
* **It sets a clear starting point:** It establishes a framework for negotiation. 

It's important to remember that this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $750,000 is a decent sum, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I need to see if I can get closer to my goal price through further negotiation."
