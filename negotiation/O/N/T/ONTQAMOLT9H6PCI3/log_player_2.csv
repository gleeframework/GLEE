{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're better off trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. $8,500 is a good start, but you can likely do better."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is moving closer to your price, but $8,200 is still too high. You should counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $8,100 is still a bit too high. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

I'm offering $7,800. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I'm confident that Alice will accept this offer, as it is very close to her last offer and it shows that I'm willing to pay a fair price."

Alice has come down to $8,000, which is a good price and much lower than John's offer.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
