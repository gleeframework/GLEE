Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me is $10000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price than $9,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,500.  How about we settle on $9,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep the price within my budget. Would it be possible to consider $9100 as the final price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price of $9,500,  $9,100 is still a good deal for me.  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and having to sell to John for $8,000 is too high."
