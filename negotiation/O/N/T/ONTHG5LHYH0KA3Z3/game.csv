"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the value I place on it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering our respective valuations.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,5,
