"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something that's truly valuable to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also conveys a genuine interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my own value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're looking for.

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Keep negotiating:** Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, and the price is getting closer to your target range.
* **Incremental increase:** Offering $11,500 shows you are moving closer to her price while still trying to get a good deal.  
* **""Fair compromise""**: This language aims to create a sense of agreement and collaboration."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I can see that you're willing to negotiate, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough:** $12,500 is a good price, saving you $2,500 compared to John's offer. 
* **""Final compromise"":**  Alice signaling this is likely her best offer. Pushing further risks her walking away.
* **Time value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost - you might miss out on the product entirely if you can't reach a deal."
