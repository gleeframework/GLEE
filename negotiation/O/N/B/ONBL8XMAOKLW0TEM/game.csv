"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth $900000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",825000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $775000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm not seeing any additional benefits that would justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $775000, but no higher.",775000.0,Bob,6,,
