"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,125,000.  This would still leave a significant profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession to get this deal done.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
