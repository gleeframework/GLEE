Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we can start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" creates a narrative that might justify the high price in Bob's mind.

**Important:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, you might adjust the price slightly downwards. However, always keep in mind your guaranteed selling price to John."
