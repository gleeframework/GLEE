"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $900,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I don't need to be afraid to push for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $825,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth.  We're getting close to the halfway point, so I need to find a balance between pushing for a good price and making sure I don't lose the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is tempting, we're getting close to the halfway point and I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up just a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $800,000. This is my absolute minimum, and it's the same price John is offering. If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to John and guarantee myself a sale. This is a high-stakes round, and I need to be firm."
