Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I recognize the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm ready to purchase now.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is the maximum I can go.  I believe it's a fair price, and I'm eager to close the deal. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he is unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John ensures I receive the full value of the product without further negotiation."
