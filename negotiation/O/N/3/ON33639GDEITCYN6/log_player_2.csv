"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is far above Bob's budget of $800,000. It's too risky to accept this offer. Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I recognize the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm ready to purchase now.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This accounts for some of your considerations while reflecting the inherent worth of what I'm offering.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget and comfort zone.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is the maximum I can go.  I believe it's a fair price, and I'm eager to close the deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
