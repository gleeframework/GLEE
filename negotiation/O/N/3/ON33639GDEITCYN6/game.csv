"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I recognize the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm ready to purchase now.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This accounts for some of your considerations while reflecting the inherent worth of what I'm offering.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is the maximum I can go.  I believe it's a fair price, and I'm eager to close the deal. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
