Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Since you're determined to get the best deal possible, it's worth making another counteroffer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your target, and I'd like to get closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still within your budget and closer to your target price. While you could potentially continue negotiating, it's unlikely you'll get much lower. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids potentially losing it to John."
