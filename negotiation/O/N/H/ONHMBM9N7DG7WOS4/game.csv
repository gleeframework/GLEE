"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it down a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your target, and I'd like to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
