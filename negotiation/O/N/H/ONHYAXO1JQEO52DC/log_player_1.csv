Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product for a price of $1,250,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product for both parties. 
* **The Plan:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close to my minimum, I'll likely accept. Otherwise, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, gradually lowering my price but staying above my minimum.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:** I'll keep John as a backup buyer in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still represents a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Message:** The message is again positive and emphasizes the value proposition for both of us. I'm framing the counteroffer as finding ""common ground"" to encourage further negotiation.
* **Next Steps:** I'll assess Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my price in subsequent rounds while keeping John as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a good compromise.
* **Potential Loss:**  Rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether.  
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer would still be a decent profit and would save me the time and effort of further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:** Considering the potential for further negotiation to fail, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision at this point."
