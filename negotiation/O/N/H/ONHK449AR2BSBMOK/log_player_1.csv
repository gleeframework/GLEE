"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of getting a higher final price.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. This helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By saying ""What do you think?"", I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation and expecting Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the Offer:**  While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation. 
* **Moving Forward:** By rejecting, I keep the negotiation going and have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $100.  
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** John offers a safe, guaranteed $80, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better deal with Bob, so I'm not selling to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $90 is closer but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to further incentivize him to accept.
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not going too far down yet, hoping to secure a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my desired price of $100 and significantly higher than my minimum of $80. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price with further negotiation, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or his counteroffers might get lower. Accepting this offer minimizes that risk.
* **Time Factor:** With only 6 rounds left, I want to secure a deal that's good for me without risking losing the opportunity altogether.
* **Potential Future Deals:** Even though I'm accepting this offer, I'm learning from this negotiation and can use this experience to strategize better in future deals."
