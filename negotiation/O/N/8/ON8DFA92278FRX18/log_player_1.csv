Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:

```

While I'd like to get closer to my target price, it's getting late in the negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer of $10,750 ensures a sale and a decent profit.  It's better than risking a further decline in price or selling to John for the lower price."
