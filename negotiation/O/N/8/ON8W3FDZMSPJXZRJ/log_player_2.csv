Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer of $1,050,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting the best possible price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for it. Can we discuss further to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than your maximum price. Although she's willing to compromise, it's still not a good deal for you. You can continue negotiating or go with John for a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get the best price for the product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering we're both getting closer to a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original price of $1,200,000. While this is a better price than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum price of $1,500,000.  Instead of continuing to negotiate and potentially prolonging the process, it's more advantageous to buy from John at a price that is within your budget. This ensures a quicker and more certain outcome."
