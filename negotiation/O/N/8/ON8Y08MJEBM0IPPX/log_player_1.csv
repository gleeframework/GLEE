"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's potential interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects this, I'll have a better idea of his valuation and can adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds. I also know that I have John as a backup, so there's no risk in starting high and seeing what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. I'm still confident I can get a better price, and I have John as a safety net if things go south."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely willing to pay closer to my initial price, and this counteroffer shows him I'm serious about getting a good price but also willing to be flexible.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have a clearer picture of his bottom line and can make a more informed decision in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting very close to my minimum. I've already rejected his previous offer and countered, and it's getting late in the game. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'm accepting his offer."
