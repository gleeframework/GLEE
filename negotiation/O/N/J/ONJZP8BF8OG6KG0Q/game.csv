"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? This would still leave you a good value for the product, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. How about $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
