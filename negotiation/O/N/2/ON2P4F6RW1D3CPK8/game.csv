"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the value of this product for both of us is undeniable. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to increase my offer to $1,075,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to walk away happy.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's make this happen.  If you're willing to come up to $1,090,000, we have a deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
