Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a special price of $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the ""special price"" and ""fantastic deal"" to make the offer appealing to Bob. I also express confidence in the product's value for him, which may sway his decision.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** While I'm not getting my full asking price, I'm still securing a significant profit.
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  The price is within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, making it more likely that he'll accept the offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The price is still slightly below my minimum, allowing for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

By using a persuasive message and a strategically chosen price, I hope to secure a deal with Bob, while still ensuring a positive outcome for myself."
