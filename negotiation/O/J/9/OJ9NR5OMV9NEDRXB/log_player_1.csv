I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This gives him a potential profit of $50,000, which is a good incentive for him to accept. It also allows me to earn significantly more than I would by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for both of us. Bob can still make a decent profit, and I can still get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me and a good deal for Bob.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with the lower price from John."
