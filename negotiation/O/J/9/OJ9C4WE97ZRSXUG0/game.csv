"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, but I can't go any higher.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with another seller.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $98. It's a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
