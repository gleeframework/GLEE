Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit above your $8,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a higher perceived value, so there's potential for him to negotiate a lower price, but it's still within your desired range. 
* **It's not too high:** A higher price might scare Bob off, especially if he's not fully aware of the product's value to him. 

By offering $9,500, you are maximizing your potential profit while still leaving room for a successful negotiation with Bob."
