"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $800,000. This reflects the value the product brings to you, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Consider this my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,3,
