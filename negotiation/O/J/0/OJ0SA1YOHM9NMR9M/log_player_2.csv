Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $800,000. This reflects the value the product brings to you, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Consider this my final offer.
