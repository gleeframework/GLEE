Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:**  While Bob values it at $10,000, he might be willing to go higher if he perceives value and you frame the offer well.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting high at $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob pushes back, while still staying above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower. However, starting high allows you to test the waters.
* **The product's uniqueness:** If the product is rare or in high demand, you can be more confident in a higher price."
