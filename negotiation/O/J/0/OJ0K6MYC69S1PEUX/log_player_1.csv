Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value of the product to you, making you seem like a reasonable seller. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Not too high:** A higher price might scare Bob off, especially since he already values the product lower. 
* **Not too low:** Selling for too low a price would mean missing out on profit.
* **Room for negotiation:**  A $4,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process.
* **Friendly tone:** Starting with a friendly message helps build a rapport with Bob and encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 

Remember, the key is to find a balance between maximizing your profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
