Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm motivated to sell, but need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice seems firm on a price that is too high for your budget. Her ""final offer"" of $15,000 is still significantly more than what John is offering. It's unlikely she'll go down much further, and you risk losing the guaranteed deal with John by continuing to negotiate."
