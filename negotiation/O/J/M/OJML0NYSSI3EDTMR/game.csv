"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? I believe this might be closer to a mutually beneficial solution.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose $1,225,000 as a compromise. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still below what I need to make this a worthwhile deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,237,500.  This is a small adjustment but brings us closer to an agreement. Let's finalize this now.",1237500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully. I would like to counter with $1,230,000. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
