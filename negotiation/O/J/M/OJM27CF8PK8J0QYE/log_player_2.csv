"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John.  While Alice's offer is better than her asking price of $150, it's still more than what you can get elsewhere.  You should reject the offer and buy from John."
