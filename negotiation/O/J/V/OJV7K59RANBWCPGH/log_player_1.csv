{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value and its potential for Bob's business, which might encourage him to accept. This strategy balances the desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and leaving you with the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for my business. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value.  There's still a chance Bob might accept a higher price, and even if he doesn't, you can always sell to John for your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price given the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a good compromise for both of us.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You've already engaged in several rounds of negotiation and there's a risk that further counteroffers will lead to a stalemate or a lower final price.  John is a guaranteed sale at your minimum, and the potential for a higher price from Bob is uncertain.  Therefore, it's best to  sell to John for $1,200,000 and secure your minimum profit."
