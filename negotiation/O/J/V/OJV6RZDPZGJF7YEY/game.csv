"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering $825,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident this will be a valuable investment for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm offering $800,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John, who is also interested in the product. I think this is a fair price that will benefit us both.",800000.0,Alice,5,
