"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $97.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $97.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $96.25?  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",96.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $96.25 is a good compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $98.75. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",98.75,Alice,7,
