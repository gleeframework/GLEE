"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** We're aiming for a win-win situation. Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still positioning the product close to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Building Rapport:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and expresses openness to discussion, fostering a collaborative tone for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer gives us room to negotiate down if needed, while still securing a significant profit above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our absolute minimum, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. We're early in the negotiation, and walking away now for a mere $50,000 profit over our fallback option isn't ideal. We'll counter in the next round and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. I've tried to find a middle ground that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,110,000? I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're showing flexibility by moving down from our initial offer, but not too drastically. A $40,000 reduction signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Justification and Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value and positioning the counteroffer as a win-win, aiming to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** This offer keeps us comfortably above our fallback option ($1,000,000 from John) and provides space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hesitant at $1,110,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,080,000. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** It's $80,000 above our fallback option with John.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could push Bob away. We're getting into the later rounds, and there's a chance he might walk if we push too hard. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now means securing the profit sooner.

Overall, while we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, accepting $1,080,000 represents a solid deal with a good balance of profit and minimized risk."
