"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. I've tried to find a middle ground that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,110,000? I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1110000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still hesitant at $1,110,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,080,000. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
