Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than my ideal price of $100. I've already tried to negotiate a lower price, and it seems like Alice is not willing to budge much further. Since I'm approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and I have the option to buy the product from John for $100, I will choose to buy from John.  This will ensure that I get the product within my budget."
