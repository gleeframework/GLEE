"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique qualities you mention, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay $14,000. This is my final offer, as going any higher would make it better to buy from John.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm not ready to accept $14,000 yet. I can offer you a compromise at $15,500. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and it's the highest price I'm willing to go. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still over my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the same price I can get from John. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $15,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000 one last time. If you're not willing to go any higher, I'll have to consider selling to John. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,7,
