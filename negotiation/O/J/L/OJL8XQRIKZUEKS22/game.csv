"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While we appreciate your offer, we need to respectfully decline it. We believe in the intrinsic value of our product and feel it's worth more than $1,000,000. We're proposing a revised price of $1,150,000, which we believe strikes a fair balance between the product's value and affordability. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
