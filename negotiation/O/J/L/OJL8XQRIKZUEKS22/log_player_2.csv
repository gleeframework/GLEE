"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. We believe it's worth every penny of its true value, which we estimate to be $1,500,000. To make this opportunity more accessible, we're offering it to you at an exceptional price of $1,300,000. We understand that this is still a significant investment, but we're confident that the product's benefits will far outweigh the cost. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is already lower than your maximum price. However, you know the product is worth less to Alice. By negotiating, you might be able to get a price closer to Alice's valuation and save a significant amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers to me."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room for bargaining and signals to Alice that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  While we start low, we don't want to insult Alice with an unreasonably low offer.  $1,000,000 is a significant amount and shows you're serious while still aiming for significant savings.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is polite, expresses continued interest, and clearly states your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While we appreciate your offer, we need to respectfully decline it. We believe in the intrinsic value of our product and feel it's worth more than $1,000,000. We're proposing a revised price of $1,150,000, which we believe strikes a fair balance between the product's value and affordability. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but we still have room to negotiate. Her counteroffer of $1,150,000 is closer to her valuation, but still a significant markup from what it's worth to her. By continuing the negotiation, we can try to nudge the price closer to the $1,000,000 mark or at least secure a better deal."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on this price."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  By offering $1,075,000, we're splitting the difference between our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This is a common negotiation tactic that signals a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our target.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message maintains a polite and respectful tone but clearly states our willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Deadline Pressure (Implied):** While not stated explicitly, continuously negotiating implies there's a limit to how long we'll continue. Alice might be more willing to accept a lower offer as the negotiation progresses."
