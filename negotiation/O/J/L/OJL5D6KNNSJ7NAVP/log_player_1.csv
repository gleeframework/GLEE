Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can meet somewhere in the middle, still making a profit above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial high price will also help you gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, you haven't lost anything. You can always go to John. If he shows interest or tries to negotiate, you know he sees value in the product.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during the negotiation process, but don't go below your $15,000 minimum."
