"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows for some negotiation room and sets a baseline for future offers. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $90 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a decent price. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to keep my expenses down. Would $90 be too low for you to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate and secure a price closer to my initial target. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $92?  It's a small compromise, but it's the best I can do. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

I'm offering $92, a small increase from Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired amount. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $90, as that is the maximum I am willing to pay. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90.  We've been going back and forth, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal is too high.  While $90 is my minimum, I'm still getting a decent price for the product."
