Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just slightly below my fallback price and significantly above Bob's valuation. It creates the perception of a deal while still leaving me with a good profit margin. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is straightforward and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
