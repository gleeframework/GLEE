"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have another option with John for $120. There's a chance you can get a better price by negotiating with Alice or going to John directly."
