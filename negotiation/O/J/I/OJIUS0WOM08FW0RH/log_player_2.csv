Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $7200 for the product. This price still reflects the value of the product while considering your budget constraints. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice is now offering $7,200, which is $200 lower than Bob's counteroffer.  
* **Value vs. Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject and then offer a higher price or even withdraw her offer entirely.
* **Savings:**  At $7,200, Bob is still saving $800 compared to buying from John.  

Therefore, accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation. It secures a good price and avoids potential risks of further negotiation."
