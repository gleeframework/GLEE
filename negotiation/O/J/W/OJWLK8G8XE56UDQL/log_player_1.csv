Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he's willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit. Bob gets a good deal ($20 below his perceived value), and you make a $20 profit over your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a little room for Bob to negotiate if he wants, potentially increasing your profit."
