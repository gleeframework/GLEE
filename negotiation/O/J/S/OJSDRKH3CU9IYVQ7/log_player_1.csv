I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point considering the value I place on the product. I'm hoping this encourages Bob to engage in negotiation and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000.  This is still above my minimum value and hopefully a more reasonable number for Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough to make me feel comfortable with the deal.  Rather than continue to negotiate with Bob, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
