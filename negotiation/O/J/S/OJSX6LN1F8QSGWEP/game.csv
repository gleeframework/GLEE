"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm ready to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true worth of this product and  $1,000,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000 as a final offer. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
