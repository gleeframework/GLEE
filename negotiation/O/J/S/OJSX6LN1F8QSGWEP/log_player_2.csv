"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  While you can buy from John for $1,000,000, there's still potential to save money by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true worth of this product and  $1,000,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $1,000,000 limit.  Since you have the option to buy from John for that price, rejecting and attempting another counteroffer makes sense.  There's still a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000 as a final offer. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for your target price, it's the most financially sensible decision at this point.  Further negotiation with Alice could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that you might not reach an agreement, leaving you with no product and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John.  

Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your maximum price point."
