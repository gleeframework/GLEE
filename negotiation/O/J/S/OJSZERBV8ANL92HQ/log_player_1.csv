Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $110?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
