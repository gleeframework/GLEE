,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $110?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $125?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product today.",125.0,Bob,4,
