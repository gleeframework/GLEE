"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $10,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still do better. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a price closer to my initial offer.  Rejecting allows me to explore more options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This would get us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk selling to John for less."
