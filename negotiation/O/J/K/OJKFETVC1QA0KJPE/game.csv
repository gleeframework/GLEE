"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves some room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to the value you'll get from the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is our final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
