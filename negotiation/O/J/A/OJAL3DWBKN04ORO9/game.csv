"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $10000. I'm willing to come down to $11500, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11500, which is $10500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I see you're getting a bit anxious, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'd like to add a bit of a premium for the convenience of a quick sale. How about we meet at $9200? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to finalize the deal quickly.",9200.0,Alice,7,
