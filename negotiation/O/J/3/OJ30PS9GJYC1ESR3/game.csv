"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about offering the product for $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. I recognize your desire for a fair price, and I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. However, $1,500,000 undervalues the inherent worth of this product.  Would you consider $1,700,000? This represents a significant investment on your part but guarantees you acquire a truly exceptional asset.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
