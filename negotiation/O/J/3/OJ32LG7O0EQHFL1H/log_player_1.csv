{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than your minimum desired price. This leaves room for negotiation, and allows you to potentially secure a deal closer to your desired price. If Bob rejects, you can counter-offer again, and if necessary, fall back to John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, below even his own perceived value of the product. It is not worth it to accept his offer when you have a guaranteed buyer in John willing to pay $15,000. It's better to reject his offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low. It's below the value I need to get for it. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $5,000 was too low, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is closer to your minimum desired price, it's still significantly lower than what John is willing to pay.  It's worth trying to get closer to your target by rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for you, as I really value your interest. It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
