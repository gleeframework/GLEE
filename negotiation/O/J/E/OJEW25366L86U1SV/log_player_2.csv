"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this fantastic product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your budget of $10,000. There's plenty of room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $15,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit of $10,000.  I'll continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There's still room for a deal, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my $10,000 limit.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get a lower price. I believe there's still room for a deal that works for both of us. If I don't get a better offer from Alice, I'm still prepared to purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you making another concession. However, $14,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500. This would be a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on your product. Let's see if we can agree on a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $14,000 is still outside my budget of $10,000. While there are still rounds left, I don't see a strong likelihood of Alice going much lower, and I'm not willing to pay above my limit. It's time to move on to a guaranteed deal with John."
