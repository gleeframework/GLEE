Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much from her initial offers. Her ""final offer"" of $13,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. It's unlikely she will come down enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
