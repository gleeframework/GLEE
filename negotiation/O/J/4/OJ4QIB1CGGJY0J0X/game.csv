"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I would be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's something you'd be willing to accept.",13000.0,Alice,5,
