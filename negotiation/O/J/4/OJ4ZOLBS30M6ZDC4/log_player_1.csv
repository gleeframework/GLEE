Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your $8,000 floor.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as the product is worth $12,000 to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially get closer to your desired price if Bob counteroffers.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above your minimum price of $8,000 and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you much closer to your desired $10,000.  Since you're not guaranteed a better offer from Bob, accepting his offer is the most logical choice to maximize your profit in this situation."
