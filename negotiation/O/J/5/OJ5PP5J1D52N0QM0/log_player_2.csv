"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I think it would be a valuable addition for you, and this price reflects its worth.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  He has room to negotiate since he's willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $11,300? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is a good price, close to his counteroffer, and better than buying from John."
