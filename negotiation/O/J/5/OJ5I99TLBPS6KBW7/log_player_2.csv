"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to get a bit more than I think it's worth to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you value the product at.  It makes no sense to pay $120 when you can get it for $80 from John."
