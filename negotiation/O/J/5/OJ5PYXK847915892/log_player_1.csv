"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob.  This could encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, while still leaving room for potential counteroffers.  I'm starting high, but I'm prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds.  If we don't reach a deal within the 10 rounds, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. I will try to bridge the gap between our prices.  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, as he's shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the unique value of my product and still offers you a good deal.  Let's find common ground and make this work!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and highlighting the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing a genuine interest in reaching an agreement. However, $16,000 remains within my acceptable range, and it leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping to secure a deal within these next few rounds to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, it's better to accept his offer than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal.  

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get closer to $15,000, there's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away. Additionally, with only 6 rounds left, the chance of reaching a higher price with Bob might be slim.  It's more prudent to accept his offer and secure the sale, knowing that I'm not far off from my desired price."
