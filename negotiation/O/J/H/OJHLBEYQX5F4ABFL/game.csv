"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to consider the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm willing to go to $825,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal here.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a personalized setup service, which is worth $20,000. So, the total value you'll get is $870,000. I think this is a fair price considering the extras I'm adding.",870000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the warranty and setup, but I'm really focused on getting the best price for the product itself.  I'm happy to pay $840,000 for the product, but I'm not interested in the extra perks at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",840000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're focused on the product itself, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the extras. However, I'm willing to compromise on the price. I'll meet you at $845,000, and I'll throw in the warranty and setup service as a one-time courtesy. This way, you'll get the product and the extras, and I'll get a fair price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",845000.0,Alice,7,
