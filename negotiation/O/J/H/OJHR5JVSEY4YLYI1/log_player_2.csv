# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,900. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.
