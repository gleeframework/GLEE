"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think this product is great, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still not quite there. I'm ready to pay $10,750 for the product.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I'm willing to pay at this time. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,900. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
