Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $1,000,000.  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm hoping he might be willing to pay a little more, especially considering he can't get the product elsewhere for less than $1,000,000.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and possibly negotiate further, but I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $850,000.  While it's closer to my minimum than his first offer, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a higher price.  If I can't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000, but I want to explore all options before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000.  This is a compromise, and I'm hoping it will be enough to reach an agreement.  I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I want to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid the risk of losing Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $900,000. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise. I'm happy to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
