Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum."
