"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. This product has significant value, as we've discussed. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,200,000. How about we try $1,150,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
