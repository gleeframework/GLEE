"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good deal for her, as it's more than what she values the product at. This also leaves room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for me. It's still lower than my maximum budget, and it's better than buying from John for $10,000. There's not much room for further negotiation, so accepting this offer is the best option."
