"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still offers you a great deal.  This product will be incredibly valuable to your business, and this price allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and it gives you a great opportunity to secure this valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground on this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $975,000 simply won't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirement.  Let's get this deal done.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
