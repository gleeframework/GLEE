Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to spend.  To get this deal moving, I'm offering $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 doesn't reflect its full potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it's a fair offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still more than I can reasonably afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, a price that's a significant compromise for me and allows for some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this point.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to the middle ground. Accepting his offer of $1,350,000 guarantees a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether in further rounds."
