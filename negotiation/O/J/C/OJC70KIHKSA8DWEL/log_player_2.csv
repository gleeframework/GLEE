"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Alice's value of $80 and well below my maximum of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation.  The message is phrased politely and expresses continued interest, which can be helpful in a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but there's still room for improvement. I'm willing to play another round to try and get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between my previous offer and her current one.  Again, the message is designed to be collaborative and agreeable, aiming for a win-win outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer you a slight adjustment to $102.50. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one! Alice is drawing a hard line, and while I could push further, there's a real chance she'll walk.  $102.50 is a decent price, and going to John means I'll definitely pay $120. It's a close call, but I'll accept to ensure I get the product."
