"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer. He's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a price that's closer to his target. $105 is a good starting point because it's still above Alice's minimum selling price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still not ideal. Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and a lower offer could be within reach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of negotiating for a lower price. Offering $110 is a compromise, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. This offer also gives Alice some room to counter if she's not comfortable with $110, but it's a good starting point for this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $110. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $117.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's target price of $120. It's important for Bob to continue negotiating to secure a better price. He can still make counteroffers and try to reach a more favorable agreement. It's too early to consider buying from John as there is still room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a good price, and I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still not comfortable with $117.50. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $112.50? It's a fair compromise and keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his negotiation. He's again offering a compromise price, but this time he's only moved up $2.50 from his previous offer, demonstrating that he's serious about getting a good deal. This counteroffer also puts the pressure back on Alice, as she might be willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $112.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $114? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers. He's only three rounds away from having to buy from John, which is his absolute limit. While $114 is slightly above his preferred price point, it's still within his budget. It's a good compromise, especially considering that Alice has also shown a willingness to meet halfway in the past. Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product without exceeding his budget and prevents him from having to resort to John's higher price."
