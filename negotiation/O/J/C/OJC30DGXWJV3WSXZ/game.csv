"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This is a fair price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $110. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $117.50?",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a good price, and I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still not comfortable with $117.50. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $112.50? It's a fair compromise and keeps the deal moving forward.",112.5,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $112.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $114?",114.0,Alice,7,
