Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle, but still ensures a significant profit margin for you. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly nudge Bob to think beyond his initial valuation and consider the benefits the product offers. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is significantly more appealing than Bob's alternative (not buying and losing out on something he values at $120). At the same time, it keeps you comfortably above your minimum acceptable price."
