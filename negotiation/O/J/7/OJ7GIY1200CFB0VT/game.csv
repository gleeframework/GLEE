"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1200000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1700000 to show my willingness to work with you. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a much more realistic starting point.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
