"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its potential while remaining within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you offering a price.  I've given this a lot of thought, and while I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price point represents a more accurate reflection of its potential. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident this product has great potential, but I can only offer $950,000. This reflects my budget and my belief in the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
