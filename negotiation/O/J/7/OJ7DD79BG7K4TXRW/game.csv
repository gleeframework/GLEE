"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,000,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider $900,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
