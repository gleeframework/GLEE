"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Enthusiasm:** The tone of the message is positive but firm on the product's value.  This opening allows us to assess how eager Bob is to buy.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so we're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is our absolute minimum acceptable price. While it matches John's offer, we have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal with Bob. We're still early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can consider.  This product has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Willing to Negotiate:** We're pushing back on Bob's low offer but showing flexibility by moving significantly closer to his price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:**  The $1,350,000 counteroffer is a strong middle ground that still provides us with a substantial profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to overpay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal. It provides us with a $100,000 profit margin over our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Negotiating Position Weakening:** While we have rounds remaining, Bob hasn't budged much from his initial offer.  This suggests his willingness to go higher might be limited.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now gives us the money sooner.  Delaying for a potentially small increase in price has an opportunity cost."
