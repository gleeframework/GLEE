"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can consider.  This product has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to overpay.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
