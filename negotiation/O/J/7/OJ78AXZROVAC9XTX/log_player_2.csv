"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Let's negotiate. Alice's starting price is too high."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate. This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  It's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're not there yet. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Meeting in the middle is often a good starting point for finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,125. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I think we can close this out. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly committed to a price above $8,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the difference is getting smaller and I risk pushing her away entirely. Accepting at $8,125 secures a decent discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
