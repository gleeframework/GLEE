"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is significant too. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is a bit low for me right now.  I'm confident this product holds a lot of value for you, and I'm prepared to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1050000?  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1050000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so how about we settle on $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
