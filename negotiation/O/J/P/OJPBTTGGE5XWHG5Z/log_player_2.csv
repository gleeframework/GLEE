"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can get a better deal by counteroffering. There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and your maximum price, leaving room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make. Let me know what you think.

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price. By rejecting this offer, you can continue bargaining and potentially secure a deal closer to your target of $750,000."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still higher than you're willing to pay.  There's a possibility she might be willing to go even lower, especially since she mentioned this is her final concession.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a bit further."
