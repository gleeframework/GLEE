Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This price still allows you a substantial profit while giving me a good deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to you and allows me to make a good purchase.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $800000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
