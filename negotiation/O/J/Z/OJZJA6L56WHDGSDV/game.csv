"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing what works best for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. This is my top limit, as I can get a similar product from John for $8,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant discount.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  How about $12,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can close the deal today. This is my final offer. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
