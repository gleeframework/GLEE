"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing what works best for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

$22,000 is far above your budget. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

$18,000 is still higher than my budget. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  How about $12,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can close the deal today. This is my final offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

While $15,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to pay. I can get the same product from John for $8,000, so I'll take that option."
