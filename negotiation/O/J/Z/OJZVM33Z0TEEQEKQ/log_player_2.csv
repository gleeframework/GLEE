"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer.  There is no benefit to rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
