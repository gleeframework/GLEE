"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  We want to leave room for negotiation while anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point.  
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique potential"" and ""benefits,"" we aim to shift the focus from just the price to the value Bob will receive.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial high price provides a buffer for us to potentially come down in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  This indicates there's room for negotiation. We will counter with a price closer to his valuation while still signaling we're willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We've significantly reduced our price from the initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,300,000 counteroffer is:
    * Still above both our minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000).
    *  Closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), potentially enticing him to engage further.
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value without explicitly rejecting his offer as ""too low."" This keeps the tone collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I could see myself agreeing to $950,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, it's still below our guaranteed sale price with John. There's still room for negotiation, and we're not in a desperate situation yet. We'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're definitely getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us, given the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but strategically:** We acknowledge Bob's progress (""getting closer"") and show further willingness to negotiate with a significant price reduction.
* **Holding Ground:** The $1,150,000 offer remains above our minimum and is strategically placed between Bob's offer and our previous counteroffer.
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to a win-win outcome rather than engaging in a purely price-driven negotiation.
* **Time Consideration:** We are past the halfway point in the rounds. While we're not in a rush,  keeping the pace of negotiation moving is important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling like we're reaching the point where we need to make a decision. To be frank, I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000 for the product. If that's not workable, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Bob is introducing a mild pressure tactic by suggesting he might ""explore other options.""  This doesn't necessarily mean he has other options, but it's a negotiation tactic to consider.
* **Above Minimum, But Room Remains:** Bob's offer is now above our minimum ($1,025,000 vs. $1,200,000). However, the difference is still significant enough to try for a better price.
* **Calculated Risk:** We'll take a calculated risk and reject his offer. We have four rounds left, and John's offer is still a safety net.  We'll counter with a price very close to our minimum, signaling this is our final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  I've tried to be flexible throughout this process. To be completely transparent, my absolute bottom line is $1,180,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We clearly state this is our ""final offer"" and ""absolute bottom line,"" setting a firm boundary.
* **Transparency and Justification:** By mentioning our attempt at flexibility and explaining it's our bottom line, we aim to maintain a positive tone and avoid appearing unreasonable.
* **Slight Concession:** The $1,180,000 offer is a small concession from our true minimum, giving Bob a final chance to meet us in the middle.
* **Time Constraint:** With three rounds left, creating a sense of urgency encourages Bob to make a decision."
