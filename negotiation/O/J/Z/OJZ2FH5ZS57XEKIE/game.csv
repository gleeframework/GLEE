"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1800000, so I'll offer $1650000. Can we agree on that?",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1650000.

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my budget limit. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to get as close to $1200000 as possible. I'll offer $1750000, but I'll throw in a bonus of a free accessory worth $50000. Can we agree on that?",1700000.0,Bob,8,
