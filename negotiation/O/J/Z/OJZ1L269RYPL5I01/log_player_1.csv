"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($80).  This gives me some room to negotiate and leaves the door open for a potential compromise.  It also lets Bob know that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $105 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my target of $100.  There are still a few rounds left, so I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this deal, but $95 is still below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $98 is close, but not quite there. I've already made a significant concession and I'm running out of time.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, and at this point, it's the most sensible choice."
