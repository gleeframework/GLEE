"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-demand item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $825,000, which is closer to my budget and still reflects the product's value. I believe this price is fair and allows us to complete this transaction.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's worth considering.",850000.0,Alice,5,
