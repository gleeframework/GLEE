Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering it for $150 would leave Bob with no incentive to buy.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($120) gives him a good deal while leaving you a significant profit margin. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
