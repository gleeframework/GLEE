Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move us forward, I could consider $1,000,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.

Bob still wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her first one, $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
