"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move us forward, I could consider $1,000,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a respectable return.",850000.0,Bob,4,
