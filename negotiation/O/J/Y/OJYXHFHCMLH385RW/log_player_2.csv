"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and you can likely get a better price by negotiating. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $9,000 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target of $8,000. There are still 7 rounds left, so you have time to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $10,200 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $9,500.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. Although it is tempting to close the deal, you can still get a better price. You are only $500 away from your target, and you have 5 rounds left. There is no reason to settle now. You can try a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on $10,000, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $9,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the price down, but I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is my last offer, so I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John for $8,000. 

While you're close to reaching your target price with Alice, it's unlikely you'll get her to go any lower. You only have three rounds left, and you risk getting stuck with a price higher than your target. It's better to secure the product at your desired price from John now."
