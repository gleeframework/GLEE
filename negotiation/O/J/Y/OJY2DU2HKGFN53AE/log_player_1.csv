Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get the best possible price from Bob.  However, I'm aware that this is a significant sum, so I'm prepared to negotiate.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal of $1,500,000."

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price."
