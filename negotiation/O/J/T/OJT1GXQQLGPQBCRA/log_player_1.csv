Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $80, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible while ensuring we get more than our minimum ($80).
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price around the middle ($120) makes it seem like a fair deal to Bob.  It's significantly less than his perceived value but still a good profit for us. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a backup buyer (John) at $80, so there's less pressure to go too low."
