"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000 for it.  Would you consider a significant price reduction?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. Would you consider $700,000? That's a firm offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more serious commitment from your side. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for this product. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
