Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a much better return than your floor price of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  You're giving Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong opening:** It establishes your initial position and sets the stage for a potential back and forth. 

Remember, you always have the option of selling to John for $800,000, so you're not taking a huge risk with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than my ideal target. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and secure a better price. I believe there's still room for both of us to find a mutually agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a strong position:** While I'm willing to come down a bit, I'm not giving away the farm. This offer shows I'm flexible but still value the product highly.
* **Offer a middle ground:**  $1,100,000 represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a fair meeting point.
* **Highlight the value:** I reiterate the value the product brings to Bob to reinforce the justification for a higher price."
