Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a higher price ($15,000) gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also anchors the value in his mind as potentially higher than $10,000.
* **Respectful Approach:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and offering Bob a preferential opportunity.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still maintaining a good chance of closing a deal with Bob."
