"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $9500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is still too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $10500.  Would you consider $10000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to make this purchase.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my goal,  $10,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $8,000 profit.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John.  There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to explore all options."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to make this deal work.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10250}
