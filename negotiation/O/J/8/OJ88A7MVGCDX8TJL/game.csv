"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $9500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $10500.  Would you consider $10000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to make this purchase.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to make this deal work.  However, $10000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10250.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. ",10250.0,Alice,5,
