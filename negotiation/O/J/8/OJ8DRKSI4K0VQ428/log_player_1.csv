"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number ($2,300,000), you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher value.  Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it sets the stage for subsequent offers and counteroffers.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high asking price, even if you're willing to come down significantly.

Remember, this is just the opening move. You have room to adjust your price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $800,000, it's still substantially below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about a higher price and encourage him to improve his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer.  To be frank,  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant and unique value, which I'm sure you recognize. How about we meet closer to the middle at $2,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  Acknowledging Bob's offer with appreciation (""appreciate you coming to the table"") helps maintain a positive negotiation environment, even while rejecting his price.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's unique value reinforces your position that a higher price is warranted.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Moving down to $2,100,000 is a significant concession from your initial offer but still keeps you comfortably above your minimum. It signals willingness to negotiate while holding firm to a strong valuation. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Suggesting a price ""closer to the middle"" is a common negotiation tactic, subtly framing your counteroffer as a balanced compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Furthermore, his negotiation tactics suggest he's unlikely to move substantially closer to your target.  He's:

* **Anchoring Low:** Despite your concessions, he's attempting to re-anchor the negotiation around a much lower price point. 
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Tactic:**  This is a common tactic to create the illusion of compromise, but in reality, he's only moving slightly from his previous offer.

Continuing negotiations with Bob carries a significant risk of wasting time and potentially getting stuck at a price point far below what John is offering.  Selling to John ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
