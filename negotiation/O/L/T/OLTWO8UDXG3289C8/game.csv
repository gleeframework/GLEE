"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price given the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
