Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate that offer, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet even close to the product's worth to you. While he increased his offer slightly each round, it's unlikely he will drastically change his position now. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
