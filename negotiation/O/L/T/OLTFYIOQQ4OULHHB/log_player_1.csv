Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a slightly lower price. I'm proposing $1,250,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum threshold. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **Framing:** The message emphasizes the value the product offers to Bob, highlighting the potential savings. 
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer leaves space for counteroffers and negotiations while still remaining within my desired range.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Keeping John in the picture provides a safety net and a potential end-point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1100000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold.**  While it's closer than his initial assessment, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting.
* **I have a better alternative.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and provides a more certain outcome. 
* **Counteroffers create uncertainty.** While I could counteroffer Bob, there's no guarantee he'll accept, and the negotiation could drag on. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and moving to sell to John, I minimize risk and secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is a bit below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm proposing $1,150,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and allows you to stay within your budget.  I'm confident this price still represents excellent value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm  counteroffering to keep the negotiation going, as it might be possible to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum threshold. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that $1,150,000 is a fair price.
* **Flexibility:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation, if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1100000 again. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has made the same offer twice, indicating a firm stance. 
* **Risk of Endless Negotiation:**  There's a risk of continuing the negotiation without any guarantee of reaching a mutually agreeable price.  
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, surpassing my minimum threshold and exceeding Bob's highest offer.

By selling to John, I avoid further uncertainty and secure a more favorable outcome."
