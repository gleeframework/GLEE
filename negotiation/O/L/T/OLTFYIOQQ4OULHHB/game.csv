"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a slightly lower price. I'm proposing $1250000. This represents a significant savings for you, and it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
