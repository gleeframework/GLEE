"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value I place on the product.  It also leaves room for negotiation, which is crucial in this situation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to counteroffer, giving me a chance to understand his perceived value and potentially reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is currently offering.  This price also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway, while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. This counteroffer gives me a better chance of securing a deal with Bob within the remaining rounds, especially since selling to John would yield a lower profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I consider fair.  I've only got four rounds left, and I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push Bob to increase his bid or perhaps reach a compromise on a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still believe there's potential to make a profit closer to my initial expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,150,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above the $1,000,000 I could get from John. With only three rounds left, I need to find a way to close the deal.  This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm still holding out for a better price than what he's currently offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to **sell the product to John for $1,000,000**. 

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer has gone below my minimum acceptable value, and the negotiation seems to be heading in the wrong direction.  While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, selling to John guarantees me a profit and prevents me from risking a complete loss.  It's better to secure a lower profit than to gamble and potentially walk away with nothing."
