"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. I think that's the highest I can stretch my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
