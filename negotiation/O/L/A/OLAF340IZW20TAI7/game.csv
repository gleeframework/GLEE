"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10,750 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  What do you say?",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with me. I understand this is your last offer, and it's not that far off from what I'm willing to pay.  Could we settle at $10,900? I'm hoping we can make a deal.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to meet in the middle once more.  How about we settle at $11,000?  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
