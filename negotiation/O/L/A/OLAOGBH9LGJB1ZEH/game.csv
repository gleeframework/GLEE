,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is also a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. I'll sell it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that high.  My final offer is $9,500.  This is the very best I can do.  Let's settle this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000, which is a fair compromise between our previous offers.",13000.0,Alice,7,
