Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, I need to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider it even though the price is slightly above his perceived worth. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
