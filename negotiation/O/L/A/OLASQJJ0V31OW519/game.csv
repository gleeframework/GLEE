"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make a slight concession and sell the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said that was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. This is the best I can do.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my last offer.",13000.0,Alice,7,
