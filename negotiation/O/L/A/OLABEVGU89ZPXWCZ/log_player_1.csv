``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, as I know the product is worth a lot to me. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the hopes of getting closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is my final offer. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm getting closer to my goal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round to try to get to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,020,000. This is a very reasonable price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1020000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are becoming increasingly difficult, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to reach a deal with Bob that meets my requirements.  

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer of $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred to get more for the product, this is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
