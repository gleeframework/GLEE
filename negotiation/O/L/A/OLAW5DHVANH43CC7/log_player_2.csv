"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is lower than what you would pay John ($1,500,000). While Alice's offer is still more than the product is worth to her ($800,000), it's the best option for you to save money."
