You can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000. It's worth exploring your counteroffer options in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, and I'll adjust my offer based on Alice's response."

Alice is coming down a bit, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, we're getting close to my target price and I'm running out of rounds.  It's likely Alice won't budge much further, and I'm comfortable with $1,075,000.  It's a good deal compared to buying from John."
