It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:**  At $8,800, you're getting a significant discount from both John's price ($10,000) and Alice's initial offer ($9,000).
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  If you reject it and go to round 10, you risk her walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time Invested:** You've already spent considerable time negotiating. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the uncertainty of further haggling."
