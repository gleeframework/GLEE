"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  I'm really interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $11,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good value."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? This would allow me to purchase the product within my budget and ensure a successful deal for both of us. I'm sure we can finalize this transaction with a price that works for everyone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer more, I'm happy to secure this deal.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
