"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  I'm really interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $11,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good value.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? This would allow me to purchase the product within my budget and ensure a successful deal for both of us. I'm sure we can finalize this transaction with a price that works for everyone.",12000.0,Bob,4,
