Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. This is a great deal, as you know this product is very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This shows my commitment to negotiating a fair price.  It's a bold move, but I'm willing to risk losing the deal if Alice isn't willing to budge. If this gets rejected, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your price point. While $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $50,000 over my limit. I'm determined to get the best possible price, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower offer.  It's a risky move, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal if I persist."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a price that's closer to my limit but still leaves room for Alice to profit.  This counteroffer demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product but also my commitment to getting the best possible deal. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1150000 is still slightly below my target price, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1175000. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $75,000 over my limit. I'm committed to securing the best possible deal, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to give up yet, and I'm confident I can convince Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over my limit.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer that's still within my budget and gives Alice a chance to close the deal. It's a significant step towards a compromise and demonstrates my willingness to be flexible.  I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough to convince Alice to accept, especially since it's only $50,000 less than her last offer."
