"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's 25% lower than Alice's initial price is a good starting point. This shows Alice you're serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for further compromise. It's also below your maximum budget of $1,000,000, leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, but it's a step in the right direction. There's still room for negotiation to bring the price down further. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by lowering her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.  This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting her halfway from your previous offer of $900,000. It's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you could potentially accept it, there's still a chance to negotiate a better price. The closer you get to the deadline, the more likely Alice is to accept a lower offer as she doesn't want to lose the sale.  Continuing to negotiate gives you a chance to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final offer and it's your maximum budget.  Since Alice has been lowering her price, there is a good chance she will accept this offer.  If she rejects it, you can always buy from John.  This strategy maximizes your chance of getting a better price while still securing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and you're running out of time. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome."
