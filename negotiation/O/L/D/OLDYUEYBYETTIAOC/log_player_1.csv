This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob.  It's a good starting point, allowing for potential bargaining while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000 yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This still leaves room for both of us to get a fair deal. Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit over budget.  How about we settle on $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
