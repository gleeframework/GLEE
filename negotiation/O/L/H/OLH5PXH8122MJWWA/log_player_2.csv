"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price, even if it's just a little bit.  Since your maximum is $150, it's worth seeing if you can get it for less.  If Alice won't budge, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend a little less.  How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $140, which is within my budget.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by trying to negotiate further."
