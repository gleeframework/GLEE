"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm offering it for a price that's fair to both of us. Let's talk about $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $120, while John wants $150.
* **You're willing to pay up to $150:**  Even though you'd prefer to save more, Alice's offer is within your budget. 

It's always better to accept a deal that's within your budget and saves you money, even if it's not the absolute lowest price possible."
