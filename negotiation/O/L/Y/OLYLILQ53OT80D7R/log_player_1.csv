Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Ensure a Better Deal Than John:** The offer must be more appealing than John's $100 offer, guaranteeing you a higher profit if Bob accepts. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
