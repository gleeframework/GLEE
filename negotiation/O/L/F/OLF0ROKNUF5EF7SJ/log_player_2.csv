Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and while we could try to haggle a bit more, $850,000 is a decent price. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiations stalling and ending up with John's $1,000,000 offer."
