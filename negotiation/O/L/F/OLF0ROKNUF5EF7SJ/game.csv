"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
