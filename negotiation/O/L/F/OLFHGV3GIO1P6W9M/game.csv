"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going below $14,000, as the product still holds significant value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $13,750. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my own valuation.",13750.0,Alice,3,

Let's split the difference and try $13,250. This would be a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to both of us.",13250.0,Bob,4,
