Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** An initial high price gives you space to potentially lower the price slightly and still make a profit if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Confident Presentation:**  By stating the product's value upfront, you create a sense of desirability and justify the asking price."
