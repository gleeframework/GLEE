"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for $1,700,000. It's a significant value proposition, considering its worth to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we start around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,000,000? This still allows for a substantial gain for you, and keeps the deal viable for me.  Consider this a fair starting point for further negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my limit. It's a fair offer considering the value I place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a significant concession, but it allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
