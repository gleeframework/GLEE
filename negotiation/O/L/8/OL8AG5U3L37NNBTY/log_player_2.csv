Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,000,000? This still allows for a substantial gain for you, and keeps the deal viable for me.  Consider this a fair starting point for further negotiations.
