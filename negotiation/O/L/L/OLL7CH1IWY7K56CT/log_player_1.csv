Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and increases your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it at $1,200,000. 
* **Urgency:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique item"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's particularly price-sensitive, you might start lower.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might offer a slightly lower, more ""fair"" price from the beginning."
