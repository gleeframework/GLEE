Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $700,000. How about we try $825,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your absolute maximum, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $850,000? It's a bit more than your top offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation: 

Alice seems unlikely to budge from the $825,000 - $850,000 range.  You've clearly stated your top price is $800,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in you getting the price you want. It's more efficient to buy from John at your target price rather than risk Alice walking away or sticking to a price above your budget."
