"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
