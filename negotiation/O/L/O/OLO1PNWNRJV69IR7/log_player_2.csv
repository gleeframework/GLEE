"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he has no reason to accept an offer that is higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant price reduction, and it's the best I can do. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, he should buy the product from John for $8,000."
