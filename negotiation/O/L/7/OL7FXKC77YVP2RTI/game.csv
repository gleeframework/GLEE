"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about $12,000?  That's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
