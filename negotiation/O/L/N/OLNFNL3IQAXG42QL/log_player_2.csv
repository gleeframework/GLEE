The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $175. This is a very high price, so Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'd be willing to sell it to you for $125.  That's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

While $125 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating for a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob has already stated his maximum price is $100.  While Alice is getting closer with her offer of $115, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. He should take the guaranteed deal from John and purchase the product for $100."
