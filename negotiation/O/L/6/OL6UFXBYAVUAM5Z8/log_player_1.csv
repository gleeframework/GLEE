Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You still have room to negotiate if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's a fair price for a product that is worth $12,000 to you.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal that is profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,000 is below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting would result in a loss. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:**  John's offer of $12,000 is within my acceptable range.
* **Counteroffering might be possible:**  While Bob claims it's his final offer, there's a chance I could negotiate a higher price by counteroffering.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to secure a deal between $10,000 and $12,000. If that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 for this product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a profit. 
* **Highlight the Value:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" and ""great deal"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, encouraging him to accept.
* **Maintain Negotiating Room:** This offer still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, while also staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still only able to offer $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Despite his claims of a ""final offer"", Bob remains unwilling to move from his $10,000 price, which is well below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Selling to John is a better option:** John's offer of $12,000 is a guaranteed profit for me and within my acceptable range. 
* **Negotiating further is unlikely to be successful:** There's little evidence that Bob will change his mind, and further negotiation would be time-consuming and potentially frustrating.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most logical choice, as it guarantees a profitable outcome without further risk or negotiation."
