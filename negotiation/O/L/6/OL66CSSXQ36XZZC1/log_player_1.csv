Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) and even slightly above your minimum ($15,000) sets a strong anchor. This creates room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like they might get a ""deal"" if they can bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value"" without being specific, you leave room for Bob to consider its worth beyond just his immediate use.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""I'm proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" suggests you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and how much you want to ensure a sale to him, you might adjust your approach."
