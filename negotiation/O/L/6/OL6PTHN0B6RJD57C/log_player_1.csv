Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum budget. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough one! Bob is holding firm at his maximum budget. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** You'll get your minimum acceptable price.
* **Rejecting and Countering:** You risk Bob walking away and losing the deal. Success depends on how much you think Bob is willing to bend.
* **Selling to John:** Guarantees your minimum but eliminates the potential for a higher price from Bob.

Since we're getting close to the wire, the risk of continuing with Bob is high.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's safer to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk Bob walking away entirely."
