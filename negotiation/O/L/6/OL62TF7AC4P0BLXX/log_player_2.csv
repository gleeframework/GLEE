{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. $9,000 is still a good deal, but there's always room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering my maximum budget. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

While $9,500 is better than John's price, I'm still hoping to get it lower.  I'll try another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $9,750 is getting close to my limit, there's still a chance Alice will budge further. I'll counter again."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering $9,250.  This is a slight increase from my last offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to get Alice to accept.  I'm running out of time, but I don't want to overpay."

Alice is getting closer to my limit and I'm running out of time. It's better to buy from John at this point to avoid potentially overpaying."
