"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to me, and still allows you to make a considerable profit.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a fair price, and allows me to get closer to the value I place on the product. Let's close this deal!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
