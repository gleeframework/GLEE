"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's simply too low. Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a significant loss for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $975,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $975,000 is just not a realistic price for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but only to $1,000,000. This offer is a significant compromise, and I'm truly hoping we can come to an agreement. If we don't, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll make a counteroffer of $925,000. I think this is the best we can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,8,
