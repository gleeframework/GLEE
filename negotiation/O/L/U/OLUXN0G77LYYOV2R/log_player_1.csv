Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's simply too low. Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  I've run out of time to negotiate with Bob, and it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired value, and I don't want to risk getting less with Bob."
