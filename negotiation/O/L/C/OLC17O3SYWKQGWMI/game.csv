"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I feel this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 doesn't cover the value this product brings. Let's try $750,000. This offer is a fair compromise and a significant step closer to a deal. I'm confident you'll find the product's value worth it at this price.",750000.0,Alice,5,
