"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** I start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" to create a positive atmosphere.
* **Direct and concise:**  The message is clear and to the point. 

This opening move is designed to:

* Gauge Bob's initial interest.
* Set the negotiation stage.
* Leave room for counteroffers and potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 9 rounds left and there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum. However, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I reject Bob's low offer but demonstrate flexibility by offering a counteroffer. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** $850,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value proposition:**  I reiterate the value the product offers to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation constructive. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* Signal my commitment to negotiation. 
* Show a willingness to compromise.
*  Bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I feel this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, $700,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 6 rounds left and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer further.  
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum. However, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal without risking a loss.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round to try and close the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 doesn't cover the value this product brings. Let's try $750,000. This offer is a fair compromise and a significant step closer to a deal. I'm confident you'll find the product's value worth it at this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I reject Bob's offer but show flexibility by offering a counteroffer.
* **Smaller increment:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, a smaller increment than before, to signal my desire to close the deal while still ensuring a profitable outcome.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product to Bob, hoping to persuade him to increase his offer.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation constructive and encourage Bob to continue.

This counteroffer aims to:

* Show my willingness to meet halfway.
* Bridge the gap between our desired prices.
* Signal my confidence in the value of the product."
