Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its significant value to someone in your position, I propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.  There's a potential profit margin of $300,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, making it a very attractive proposition. It also allows you to secure a significant portion of the potential profit margin. 

**Important Note:** This assumes a one-shot negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there might be room for further negotiation and counter-offers."
