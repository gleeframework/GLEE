"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can get great value out of this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is tempting, I can't go that low.  Would $13,000 work for you?  It's a small difference but would help me feel better about the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really close to my budget. How about $11,000? I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us. If you're not able to accept this, I might have to go with another offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
