"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's best to reject and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. Bob can likely get a better deal with further negotiation.  Rejecting and counter-offering again allows for more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can get great value out of this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is tempting, I can't go that low.  Would $13,000 work for you?  It's a small difference but would help me feel better about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $10,000, and John is offering it for that price.  Alice is only $1,000 away from Bob's maximum price. There is a good chance Bob can negotiate down to $11,000 or $12,000 with another counteroffer, which would be more attractive than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to my budget. How about $11,000? I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us. If you're not able to accept this, I might have to go with another offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
