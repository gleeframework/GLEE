"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that represents a significant gain for you. While the true value of this product is far higher, I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This price point allows you a substantial profit margin while still providing me with a fair return on my investment. Consider this a mutually beneficial opportunity. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
