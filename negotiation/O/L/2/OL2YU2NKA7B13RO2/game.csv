"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $8,200 on this sale. Let's meet in the middle at $8,200. What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal. What do you think?",7800.0,Bob,4,
