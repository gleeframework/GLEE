{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter, keeping in mind the value of the product to him and my potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While he's interested, his offer is too low. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter again, but I'll be more firm in my price to see if we can reach an agreement or if I should move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's worth.  If you're not able to reach that, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made significant concessions.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  To avoid further negotiation and potential losses, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
