,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's worth.  If you're not able to reach that, I may have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
