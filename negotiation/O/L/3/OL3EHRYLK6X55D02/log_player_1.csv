"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a good price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. I want to see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to push for more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price and I'm worried about running out of rounds.  It's time to secure the deal."
