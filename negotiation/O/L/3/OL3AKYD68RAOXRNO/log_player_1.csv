Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,400,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,410,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,410,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,410,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum.  I'm not sure I can get much better, and I want to avoid risking the deal by going back and forth further.  $1,410,000 is a solid profit, and I don't want to lose that opportunity."
