"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a substantial decrease from Alice's initial price, leaving room for negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

Bob is going to offer a price slightly higher than his maximum value, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This indicates a willingness to negotiate while keeping a safety net."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum value. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed price within his budget. Continued negotiation with Alice might lead to a better price, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of exceeding his budget is too high."
