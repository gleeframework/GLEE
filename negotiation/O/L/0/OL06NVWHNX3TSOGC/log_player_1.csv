Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is a bit high for me, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$95 is still a bit below what I want, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go any lower than $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $100, but I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement.  The offer of $92 is still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk further rounds of negotiation, so I'll sell to John for $120."
