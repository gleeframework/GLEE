Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better deal.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could try a different approach, such as a slightly lower price to appear more reasonable or a more detailed explanation of the product's value to justify the higher price."
