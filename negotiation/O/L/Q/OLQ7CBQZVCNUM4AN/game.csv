"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while staying within my limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,050,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my financial limits. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.  This price reflects a fair value for the product while enabling me to finalize the purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $975,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let me know if this works for you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $975,000 is a good number, I'm still hoping for a bit more wiggle room. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This price reflects my budget while allowing us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a competitive price, and I've tried to be flexible. To be frank, $975,000 is my absolute bottom line. If you're unable to meet that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,
