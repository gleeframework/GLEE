"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high, so rejecting and counteroffering is the best choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while staying within my limits."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,050,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my financial limits. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.  This price reflects a fair value for the product while enabling me to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $975,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $975,000 is a good number, I'm still hoping for a bit more wiggle room. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This price reflects my budget while allowing us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a competitive price, and I've tried to be flexible. To be frank, $975,000 is my absolute bottom line. If you're unable to meet that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear that $975,000 is her absolute bottom line.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of her walking away is high, and I'm unlikely to get a significantly lower price. At this point, it's more prudent to secure the product from John at $800,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiation uncertainty."
