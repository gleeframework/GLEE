Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $100, which is my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $105?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's a good deal to accept.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and saving $5 is better than overpaying or potentially missing out on the product altogether."
