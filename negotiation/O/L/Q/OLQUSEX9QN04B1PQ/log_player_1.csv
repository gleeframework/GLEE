"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to make it seem like a good deal.

**Note:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This will influence my counteroffers in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** While $800,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's simply not worth it for me to sell below my minimum.
* **I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.** This makes waiting for a better counteroffer from Bob a more attractive option.
* **I'm not desperate to close the deal.** I'm willing to engage in further negotiations to see if I can get a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, still leaving room for compromise but not accepting his lowball offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000).
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product, but also emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:** 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer, while a slight improvement, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can still sell to John for a higher price, giving me more leverage in negotiations.
* **Potential for further compromise:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $850,000, but still below my minimum, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product.  How about we settle on $900,000? It's a compromise on both our ends, and allows us to move forward with this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** My counteroffer is a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's also lower than my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the potential for a successful agreement.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise that benefits both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll need to consider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or if it's better to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can close this deal for $875,000. This price is reasonable given our respective needs, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in a quick agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, time is becoming a factor. However, I still have the option to sell to John for a higher price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob seems willing to compromise. I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $875,000, aiming to find a middle ground. If he rejects again, I will seriously consider selling to John in the following round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to accept $925,000. This shows a real commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a middle ground between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $875,000. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm framing this as a final compromise to show that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Limited time:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm increasing pressure to get closer to a deal.
* **The possibility of selling to John:** I'm still holding onto the option of selling to John, which provides leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round.  It's getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I need to ensure I get a price that's worth my time."
