"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $10500? It's still a good compromise, considering the value I'm getting from the sale. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $10200? It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
