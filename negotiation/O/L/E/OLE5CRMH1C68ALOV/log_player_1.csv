"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see its true value once you start using it."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you consider $12,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you seem really interested in this product and I want to make a deal happen.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to go above $13,500 and is negotiating in small increments.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best way to maximize profit and avoid potentially wasting more time with Bob."
