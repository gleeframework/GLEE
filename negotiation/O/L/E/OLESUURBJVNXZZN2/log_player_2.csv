"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by making a counteroffer.  It's worth exploring whether Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is a good price, I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you consider dropping the price to $10,500? I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its value to you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. He's already stated his maximum budget is $10,000, and there's no indication that Alice is willing to go lower. To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should take the guaranteed deal from John for $10,000."
