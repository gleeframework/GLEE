Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $14,500. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it's worth the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""suggesting"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If Alice knows Bob to be very price-sensitive, a slightly lower starting price might be more strategic. 
* **Market Demand:**  While Alice has a guaranteed buyer, a faster sale is generally preferable. If the market is hot, she might be able to push for an even higher price."
