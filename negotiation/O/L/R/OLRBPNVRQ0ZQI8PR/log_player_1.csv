Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit above John's offer. 
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The message emphasizes the product's value and fairness of the price without being overly aggressive. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at the highest price while still leaving a safety net in the form of John's offer."
