"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're committed to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
