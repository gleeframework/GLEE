# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe you'll really appreciate the value it brings to your life, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option for Bob."
