"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm confident that the product's value is higher than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000. I believe this price is fair given the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised by offering $11,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, though. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1,000, which will bring the total value to $12,500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extra service you're offering, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which reflects the value of the product and the extra service. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $12,250, which is $250 more than my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the extra service I'm offering. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the extra service. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a final agreement, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll sell it to you for $12,000, which is $500 more than my previous offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
