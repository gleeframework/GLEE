Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while ensuring I get significantly more than John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer and making it a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to decide quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slightly):** While the message is firm, offering it at $1,150,000 leaves a tiny bit of room if Bob attempts a counter-offer. However, I'm prepared to walk away knowing I have John's guaranteed offer."
