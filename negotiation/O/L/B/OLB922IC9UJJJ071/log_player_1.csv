"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" framing it as a premium offering worth a premium price. 
* **Future Rounds:** Depending on Bob's response, I can adjust my strategy. If he outright rejects the offer, I know I need to significantly decrease the price. If he counter-offers, it gives me more information to work with.
* **John as Leverage:** The presence of John, my guaranteed buyer, gives me a strong position. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, which allows me to be more assertive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is quite high for me. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my target while still acknowledging Bob's initial bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. It seems we have quite a gap to bridge. Understanding your perspective, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of this product and its potential returns for your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Calculated Reduction:** While I'm dropping the price considerably from my initial offer, I'm still aiming high above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer. This signals that I'm serious about selling but not desperate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition, aiming to shift Bob's focus from the price alone to the potential return on investment.
* **Information Gathering:** This counter-offer allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility. His reaction will determine whether he's genuinely interested in negotiating within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $750,000. I believe this offer is a fair reflection of both the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to his perceived value, it's still drastically below my minimum. His message also suggests he might be willing to go higher. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair price for this high-value product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's movement while standing firm on a price above my minimum. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost.
* **Strategic Concession:** By reducing my price by $300,000, I'm making a significant concession to incentivize Bob to do the same.
* **Deadline Awareness:** With five rounds left, I need to guide the negotiation toward a realistic closing point. This offer keeps the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement while keeping John as a viable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I can go up to $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering your need to sell and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Gap Remains:** Bob is now nearing his perceived value of the product, but $900,000 is still significantly less than my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only four rounds remaining, I need to apply a bit more pressure.  
* **John as Leverage:** I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Bob if he doesn't make a substantial jump in his offer. John's standing offer gives me this flexibility."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we need to bridge this gap. Your offer is generous, but the product's intrinsic value is significantly higher.  To be candid, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this would be a valuable asset for you. My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to close this deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  With limited rounds remaining, I'm putting forward my final offer.  This price is a significant drop, showing flexibility, but still above my absolute minimum.
* **Urgency & Competition:**  I'm subtly introducing John, the other buyer, to create a sense of urgency without revealing my guaranteed price.
* **Relationship Building:**  While emphasizing the product's value, I reiterate my preference to close the deal with Bob. This can help in securing a deal without completely alienating him.

**Strategy:**

This offer forces Bob to seriously consider the deal. If he's genuinely interested, he'll likely counter-offer close to my price. If he's unwilling to budge significantly, I'll likely walk away and sell to John in the next round."
