"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my initial counteroffer.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,950,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,950,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is my absolute limit.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our respective positions.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
