{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiating a fair price, but I'm sure you'll agree it's a steal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still out of my range. Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This allows you a good profit margin while staying within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my desired price than selling to John."
