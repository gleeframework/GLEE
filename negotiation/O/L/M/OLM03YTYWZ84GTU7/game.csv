"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiating a fair price, but I'm sure you'll agree it's a steal considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still out of my range. Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This allows you a good profit margin while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
