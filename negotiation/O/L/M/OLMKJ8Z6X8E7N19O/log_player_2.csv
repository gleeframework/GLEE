# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still save money compared to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise that would benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't go lower without risking losing the deal."
