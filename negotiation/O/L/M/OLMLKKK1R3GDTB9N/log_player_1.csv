Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I'm willing to part with it, I wouldn't sell it for anything less than $80. How about we settle on a price of $120? Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $150.
* **Aiming high, but staying reasonable:** Starting with $120 is a strong opening. It's a significant profit for you (well above your minimum) while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his own valuation. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that you wouldn't go below $80, you create a sense of transparency and fairness, even though you're aiming closer to the upper limit.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation is possible:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to negotiate further or accept his offer.
* **John is your safety net:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John. Don't be afraid to walk away from a low offer from Bob."
