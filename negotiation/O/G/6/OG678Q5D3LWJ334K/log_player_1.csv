Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always good to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to make a good profit if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest. If he's very enthusiastic, you might be able to get away with the higher price. If not, you can always negotiate down.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you at least $120. This knowledge allows you to be more confident in your initial offer to Bob."
