"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her true value, it's still higher than your maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate further and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by bridging the gap between Alice's offer and your maximum budget. It's a significant discount from her offer, but still higher than your alternative offer from John. This makes it a reasonable starting point that shows your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  While there's a chance she might come down further in future rounds, it's not guaranteed. It's safer to take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000 and avoid risking further negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome."
