I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point - it's higher than my minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum price, as the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than what John is offering, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, as he clearly values the product at $100.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to him and my desire to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $82 is too low.  Selling to John for $80 is the best option at this point, as it guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation."
