"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit too high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to me is $150. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
