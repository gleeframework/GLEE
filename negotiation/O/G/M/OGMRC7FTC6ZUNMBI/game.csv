"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, as it's the maximum value I see for it. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. It's the most I can afford, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're committed to your initial offer of $800000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to at least break even. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
