{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product for Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work something out within my budget. How about $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it ensures I get at least my desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing out to John."
