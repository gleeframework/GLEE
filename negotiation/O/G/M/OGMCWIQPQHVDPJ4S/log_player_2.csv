You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  You're still saving money compared to buying from John."

You're still closer to your target price with John, so it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice one more time."
