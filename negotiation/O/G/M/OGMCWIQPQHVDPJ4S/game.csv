"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $10,800.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get as close to your desired price as possible, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,650. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10650.0,Bob,4,
