"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price point. It's  worth exploring counter-offers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That's still a great price for you considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's maximum price point, it's still slightly higher.  Bob can try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  There are still several rounds available to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford right now.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 10000}
