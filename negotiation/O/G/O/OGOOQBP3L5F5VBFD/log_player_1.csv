Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit above my minimum value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm curious to see if he's willing to pay that much!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $90, as it's below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with a price of $120. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a reasonable compromise for Bob."

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I can get from John.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the hassle of further negotiation."
