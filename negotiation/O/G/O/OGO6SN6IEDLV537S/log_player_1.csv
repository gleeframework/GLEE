Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $170.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $155. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and his offer, and I hope it will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, it's clear that we're not going to come to an agreement quickly. To avoid further back-and-forth, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further potential losses in time and effort."
