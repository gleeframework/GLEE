"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Since the product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer is not a good choice. Buying from John for $10,000 is always an option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, so he starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a starting point for negotiation, and Bob is willing to go higher if necessary, but he's trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and is a better price than buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or running out of time."
