"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your best offer, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given our positions.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting close.  While I appreciate you coming down to $1,125,000, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my previous offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,112,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1112500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,125,000.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
