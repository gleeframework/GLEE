This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $109.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price, and I've already made multiple concessions.  It's becoming clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I receive a price that meets my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
