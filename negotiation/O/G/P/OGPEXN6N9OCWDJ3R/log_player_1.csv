{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can consider lowering the price a bit, but always keep in mind your minimum price and the potential of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
