"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to negotiate a bit further. Would you consider $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate further, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
