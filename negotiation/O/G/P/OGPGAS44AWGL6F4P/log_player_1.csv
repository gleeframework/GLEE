Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a sense of urgency and scarcity (mentioning other interested parties). Bob gets a good deal compared to its worth to me, while I still gain a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and this starting point allows for some flexibility to reach a mutually agreeable price."
