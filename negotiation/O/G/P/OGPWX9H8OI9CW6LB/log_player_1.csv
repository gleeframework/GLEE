Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product name] that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm choosing a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $150, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I've also included a friendly message to make the initial interaction more appealing. 

Keep in mind:

* **This is a starting point.** We'll adjust based on Bob's response.
* **No information is given about Bob's likely price.**  It's a guessing game.
* **There's always John as a backup.**  We can walk away if the negotiation gets too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the [product name]. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is my minimum, Bob is offering the bare minimum.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $175?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to work with you on this."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm choosing to counteroffer at $175. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. I've included a friendly message to maintain a positive rapport and emphasize the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $160 for the [product name]. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160.  While it's not the highest price I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum of $150 and a better deal than selling to John.  This is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
