Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a significant amount for Bob, but it's still lower than the value he places on the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage and potentially lead to a win-win scenario.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  I am still well above my minimum of $800,000, so I am not taking an unacceptable risk by offering this price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be carefully monitoring Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if needed. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm also aware that John is a backup option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:** While it's above my minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me and what I initially offered.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the process.
* **Risk mitigation:** I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not risking losing out on a significant amount of money by rejecting Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $950,000.  I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to balance maximizing my profit while still maintaining a good chance of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $850,000 and my initial offer of $950,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While this is a concession, it still positions me with a substantial profit margin and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate but also sets a firm price point that reflects the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, I've successfully secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether to accept his counteroffer or proceed with the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited upside:** Further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I don't want to risk John changing his mind or finding another buyer.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
