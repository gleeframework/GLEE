{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer of $950,000 allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $850,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum selling price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also allowing you to save a considerable amount of money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to try and push for a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  There's still a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $875,000.  This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to keep the price below $900,000.  It's a good middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
