Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving myself some room to negotiate.  I'm assuming Bob has some interest in the product since he's a potential buyer, but I'm not sure how much he's willing to pay.  I'm hoping to get as close to his maximum value as possible while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it might be tempting enough for him to accept while still giving me a profit higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as before, so I don't see much point in continuing to negotiate. I've already made a counteroffer and it was rejected, so it's likely that he won't increase his offer.  $12,000 is a good price and it's above my minimum, so I'll accept."
