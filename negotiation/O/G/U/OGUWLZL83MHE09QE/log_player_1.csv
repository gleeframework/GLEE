Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  It's a high price, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob isn't willing to pay that much. It also shows I'm open to negotiating, making him more likely to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, so it makes sense to take it.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer if I reject him."
