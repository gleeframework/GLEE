(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $14,000 is still above my comfortable spending limit. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still room for a better price. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made a concession, $13,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I am willing to continue negotiating, as we are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $13,000 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $12,500? I'm sure we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise a bit."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $12,500 is still a little too low.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $13,250.  This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to negotiate and come down in price, $13,250 is still outside my budget. I'm running out of rounds, and I'm concerned that I won't be able to get the price down to my comfortable range.  To avoid potentially spending more than my limit, I'll take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000."
