"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about $12,000? I'm very interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $13,000 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $12,500? I'm sure we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise a bit.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $12,500 is still a little too low.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $13,250.  This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",13250.0,Alice,7,
