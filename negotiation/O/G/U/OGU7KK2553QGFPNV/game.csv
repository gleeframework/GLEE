"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $8,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This would be a great deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,625.  That's a good price for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,4,
