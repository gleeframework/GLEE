"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly above your budget and your maximum price. It's best to negotiate down or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $65. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to work with you. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above your maximum price and John's offer.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between your previous offer and her current one. It keeps the negotiation moving while staying below your $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? That would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. It's time to cut your losses and take John's offer of $80, saving you $5 and potentially further negotiation."
