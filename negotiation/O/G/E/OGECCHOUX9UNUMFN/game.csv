,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $75 for the product.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $82.50 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80 for the product.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $80. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $85. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value.",85.0,Alice,5,
