,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11000.  This is still a good price for you, and it's the best I can do at this time.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the final offer I can make.",10500.0,Alice,5,
