Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for a higher profit than John's offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's likely to counter, giving you space to bargain. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  $11,000 is significantly less than the $12,000 Bob values the product at, making it tempting for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than John's offer,  it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10,000? This would be a good compromise, allowing both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer a higher price, $9,500 is a decent profit and significantly better than John's offer.  This offer represents a good compromise and minimizes the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or losing Bob entirely."
