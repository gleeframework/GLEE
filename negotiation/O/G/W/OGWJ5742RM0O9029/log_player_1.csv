Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'll see how he responds before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of him. There's a chance he's willing to pay more, and I'm not going to give up that potential profit without trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hopefully showing some willingness to negotiate while still securing a higher price than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can get much more out of him.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'd rather secure the sale and avoid the risk of him walking away."
