{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product here that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value in this product,  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the product's worth to me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product's potential value is significantly higher.  To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's worth, and I believe it's within reach of your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential, and it allows us to find a mutually beneficial solution. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still not close to my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my goal with John, who's willing to pay $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed sale, and it's the best option right now."
