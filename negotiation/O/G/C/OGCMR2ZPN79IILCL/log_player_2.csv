# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product here that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident you'll find this opportunity worth exploring. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product's potential value is significantly higher.  To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price is still fair considering the product's worth, and I believe it's within reach of your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
