"Bob, I have a product here that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident you'll find this opportunity worth exploring. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value in this product,  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product's potential value is significantly higher.  To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price is still fair considering the product's worth, and I believe it's within reach of your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential, and it allows us to find a mutually beneficial solution. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
