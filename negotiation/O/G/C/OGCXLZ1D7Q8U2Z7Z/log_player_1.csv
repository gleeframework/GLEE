Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience."",
 ""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Close to My Minimum:** The offer of $1,450,000 is just below my guaranteed selling price, maximizing potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive"" and ""time-sensitive,"" I create a sense of urgency and importance, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to balance:

* **Profit Maximization:**  Trying to secure the highest possible price from Bob.
* **Risk Management:**  Not losing the guaranteed sale to John if Bob rejects the offer."
