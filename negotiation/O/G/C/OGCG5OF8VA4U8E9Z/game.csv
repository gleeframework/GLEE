"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
