# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price.
