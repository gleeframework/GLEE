"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that holds immense value to you. Given its significance to you, I understand its worth is $1,500,000. My aim is to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I am proposing to sell the product to you at a price of $1,200,000. This offers you a significant saving compared to its intrinsic value while still allowing me to receive a fair compensation for the product. I believe this price reflects its quality and the benefits it will bring to you.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am here to answer any questions or address concerns you might have.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice

Explanation: While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might prompt her to come down to a more favorable price.
