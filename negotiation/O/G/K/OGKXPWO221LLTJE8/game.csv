"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $6,000 for it to make sense for me.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  That said, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
