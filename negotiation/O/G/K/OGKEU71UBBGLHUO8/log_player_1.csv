"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make him consider the offer more seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which I'm prepared to handle. 

**Plan:**

I'll use the first few rounds to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. If he seems unwilling to go above $800,000, I'll start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates my seriousness about getting a fair price and may encourage him to raise his offer.

**Plan:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer. My goal is to see if I can find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000 to reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer, but not too much:** My counteroffer is $100,000 less than my initial price, showing flexibility. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I again highlight the product's true value to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I express willingness to compromise to keep the negotiation open.

**Plan:**

I'll observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he's still unwilling to budge, I'll start considering the alternative of selling to John in the next few rounds.  If he offers closer to my price, I'll be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John.
* **Significant difference:** The gap between our desired prices is still considerable.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob or sell to John.

**Plan:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate.  If Bob doesn't come closer, I will start seriously considering selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for you, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** My counteroffer is now just $50,000 away from John's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing value:** I again highlight the deal's value for Bob.
* **Closing pressure:** I am now suggesting a final deal to push Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Plan:**

This is a critical round. If Bob accepts, I secure a good profit. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to push further with him or finally accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to offer $980000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still $20,000 below John's offer.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, and further negotiation with Bob could risk losing time and potentially getting a worse offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, which is crucial given the limited remaining rounds.

**Plan:**

Although I would prefer a higher price, selling to John now secures a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not yield a better outcome."
