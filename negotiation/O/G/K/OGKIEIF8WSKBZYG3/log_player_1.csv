"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **10 rounds:** I have plenty of time to negotiate, so I'm not rushing into a deal. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** While $120 is my minimum, I'm not immediately jumping at it. I want to explore if I can get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation room:** Even if I only get $130, that's still a $10 profit over selling to John.
* **Exploring options:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal. This keeps the negotiation alive and shows Bob I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping the price but not going all the way to Bob's initial offer.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation open and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. Would you consider $125 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just $5 below my minimum, and I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Potential for better deal:** I still have a few rounds left to potentially negotiate further, but there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit and avoids further negotiation, which could be time-consuming and ultimately result in a lower price.
* **John's offer as a fallback:** Even if I don't get a better offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for $120."
