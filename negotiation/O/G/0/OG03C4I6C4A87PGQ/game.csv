"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
