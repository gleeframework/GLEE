You should reject Alice's offer. You're still able to get a better price, even if it means negotiating further. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your $1,000,000 goal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1100000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer.  You are close to your target price of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and the price could go back up, or you could waste more time and end up buying from John anyway. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price that's within your budget and avoids further haggling."
