Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a sense of getting a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's significantly lower than my minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **It's not too low:**  I don't want to make a counteroffer immediately seem like an outrageous jump in price. 

By starting with this offer, I set the stage for a negotiation that can potentially benefit both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1250000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price. I can counter-offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,150,000, which is a compromise on my side, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. This shows him that I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to be flexible."
