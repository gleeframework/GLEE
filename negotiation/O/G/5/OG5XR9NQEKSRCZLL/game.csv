"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $16000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I am still unable to meet at $17000. I would like to propose $16500 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,4,
