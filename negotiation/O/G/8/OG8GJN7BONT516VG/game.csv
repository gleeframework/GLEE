"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to be happy. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
