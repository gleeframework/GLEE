Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum. This allows for some room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to that with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $105 is tempting, I'm still a bit above that.  How about $110?  It's closer to your offer, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle again? Would you be willing to go down to $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $107.50 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired price of $120. I am going to sell the product to John for $120.  This ensures that I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
