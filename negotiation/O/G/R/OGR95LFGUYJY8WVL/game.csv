"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. It's a good compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11500. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",11500.0,Bob,4,
