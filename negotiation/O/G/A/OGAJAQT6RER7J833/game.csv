"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $950,000. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand you see the value in this product. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm looking for something closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
