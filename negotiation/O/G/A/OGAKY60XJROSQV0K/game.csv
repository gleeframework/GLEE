"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you, and closer to what I need. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but at $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to stay within your budget while ensuring I can get a reasonable price for the product. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,750. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,500? I'm willing to make a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
