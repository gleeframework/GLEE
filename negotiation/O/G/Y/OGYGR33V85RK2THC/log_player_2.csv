```"

Round 3

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $9,250 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```
