{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, allowing him to make a profit while still leaving room for me to make a profit that's closer to my desired value.  I'm also setting the stage for a potential negotiation if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I would get from John.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000 for this product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $960,000 for the product. I believe this price respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000, it seems like negotiations with Bob are getting close to a stalemate. Accepting his offer of $960,000 will still yield a significant profit and avoid any further potential delays."
