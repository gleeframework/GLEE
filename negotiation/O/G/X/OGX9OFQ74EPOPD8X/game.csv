"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value it holds for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $10,500 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to check out some other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but $10,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
