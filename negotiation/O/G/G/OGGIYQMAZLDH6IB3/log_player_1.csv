Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I'm asking for $12,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my asking price.  $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can do better with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is closer to my asking price, I'm still not satisfied with that amount. I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to come down a little from my last offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle from $9,500 to $10,000, and I'll offer $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,800 is getting closer to my asking price, I'm still confident that I can push for a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $9,900. This is a fair price for the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,900 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500 to $9,900, so how about $9,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We've reached a point in the negotiations where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
