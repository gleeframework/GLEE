# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay at this point. There's still potential to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. $825,000 is a good deal considering John is selling the product for $1,500,000. It's worth accepting this offer and saving a substantial amount of money."
