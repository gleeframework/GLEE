Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price ($80).
* **Target Price:** Aiming high initially is a good strategy. By starting at $120, we leave room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing we have John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects our initial offer, we can always fall back on this sale.

**Important Note:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but the potential gain from a successful $120 sale outweighs the risk of losing some profit by starting lower."
