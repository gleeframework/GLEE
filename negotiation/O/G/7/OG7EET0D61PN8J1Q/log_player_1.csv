"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to secure a price close to Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for potential concessions while ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can secure a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer but still significantly lower than my initial asking price. This strategy aims to demonstrate flexibility while maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and it's getting closer to the middle ground. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing with each round. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids potentially losing out on a guaranteed $1,250,000."
