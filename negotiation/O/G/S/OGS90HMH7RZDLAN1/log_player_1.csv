``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly lower than your minimum, leaving space for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below my desired earnings. I will try to negotiate further by countering his offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand you're working with a budget, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? This price would allow me to move forward with the sale and ensure you get a fantastic product at a competitive rate."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1125000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also a reasonable compromise considering the back and forth.  I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiations and secure the sale."
