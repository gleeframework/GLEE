"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob keeps going lower than my minimum, and I've already made concessions. While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $100."
