Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $80 for it right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $120. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
