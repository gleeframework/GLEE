Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my value."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, don't you think?

$1,225,000 is still too low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but I won't sell for less than what I think the product is worth."

Round 5
