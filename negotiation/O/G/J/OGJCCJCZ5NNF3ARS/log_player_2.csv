# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also being more affordable for you. What do you think?

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $800,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to budge, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $795,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to accept.

Alice is clearly holding firm around her value of $800,000. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal, and continuing to negotiate risks her accepting John's offer.  $795,000 is a reasonable compromise."
