"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also being more affordable for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $800,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for being patient with me. I'm willing to budge a bit more.  How about $780,000? I think that's a fair offer that considers both our positions.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to budge, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000.
