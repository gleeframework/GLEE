"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price. While you could accept and save some money compared to buying from John, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $105, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can offer you a slight concession at $108. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price, especially since you have several rounds left. While you could buy from John at $100, continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially get you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but $108 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $102, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already met you halfway and offered you a great deal at $110, and now you're only willing to go up to $102? I'm not going to go any lower than $110. Let's meet somewhere in the middle at $110. I'm not budging from this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing signs of frustration and isn't budging from her price. While negotiating further could lead to a deal, it's becoming increasingly likely she'll remain stubborn.  With only three rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with her outweighs the potential savings.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum budget and saves time and potential frustration."
