Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

While $1,350,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum price. I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, so I'll take that deal instead."
