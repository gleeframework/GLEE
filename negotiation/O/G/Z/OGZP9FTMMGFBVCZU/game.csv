"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This is my best offer and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
