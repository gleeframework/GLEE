Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something closer to $1,100,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, and I think I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a good return on your investment. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close.  $1,025,000 and we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target, I still have some room to negotiate and don't want to settle for a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference.  $1,037,500 and we can close this deal.  This is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
