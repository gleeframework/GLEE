"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
