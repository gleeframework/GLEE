,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $100 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about $110?  I'm confident this is a price that's fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I think this is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
