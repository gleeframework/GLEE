"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to its true value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This would be a fair price for me to purchase the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
