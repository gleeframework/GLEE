"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While your offer is appreciated,  I'm confident that the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a lower price than John's offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can make another counteroffer and try to drive the price down further.  There is still room for negotiation as Alice has already lowered the price from her initial offer."
