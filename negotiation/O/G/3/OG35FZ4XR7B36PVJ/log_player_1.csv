Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's lower valuation while leaving me room to increase the price if necessary.
* **Message:** I've tried to be friendly and persuasive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This helps establish a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick and efficient negotiation. By starting with a relatively low offer, I hope to encourage Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll have a good understanding of his negotiation range, allowing me to make a more informed counteroffer. If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that low, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point. This will allow me to gauge his willingness to increase his offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  If his counteroffers remain too low, I can always opt to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. It's still well above Bob's valuation but shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and focused on finding a compromise. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.

**Strategy:**

By lowering my price slightly, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a position that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to increase his offer and potentially lead to a deal closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for a price that's so far below my valuation.  

**Strategy:**

Since Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to budge further, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids further time-consuming negotiation with Bob."
