"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're close to reaching a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,
