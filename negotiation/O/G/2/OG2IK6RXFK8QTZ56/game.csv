"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is just too low. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  Let's try $13,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'd be willing to do $13,000 even.  Does that work for you?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  It's a small compromise on both our parts, and I believe it's a fair deal that we can both agree on.",13250.0,Alice,7,
