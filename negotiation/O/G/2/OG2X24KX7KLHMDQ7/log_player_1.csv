"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning that it's a ""great deal"" hints at the value of the product, without revealing my true minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation and potentially earn more. 
* **Ten Rounds:** I have time to work with Bob.  There's no need to rush into a deal at this point.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While $100 is guaranteed from John, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $95?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm  countering Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not to cave in completely. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $95 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's,  which should make him feel like we are moving towards an agreement.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the quality of the product helps justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable value ($100).
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still a chance to get a better price. I have more rounds to negotiate.
* **Safeguard:** While $100 is guaranteed with John, I'm not desperate for a sale and can afford to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable value of $90, as $85 is below my threshold.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight concession from my previous offer, showing willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Highlighting the ""value of the product"" reinforces its worth and justifies the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $82.50 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. 
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  If I continue to reject, there's a chance Bob will offer an even lower price, potentially forcing me to accept something below my desired value.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's a safe and secure option.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to frustration and a less favorable outcome. It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
