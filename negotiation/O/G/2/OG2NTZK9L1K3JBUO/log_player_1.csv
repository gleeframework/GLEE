Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $60, as it's well below my minimum value of $120.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking interest in the product. However, $60 is quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $90? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's valuable to you Alice, and I am interested in finding a fair price. Would you be open to meeting halfway at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $85. This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $80, and it gives me a bit closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 85}
