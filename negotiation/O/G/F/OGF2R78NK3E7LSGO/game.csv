"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's true value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
