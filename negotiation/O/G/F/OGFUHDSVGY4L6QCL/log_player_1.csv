Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially saving you considerable resources in the long run. I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000. This offer stands for 48 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,400,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make him perceive a lower offer as more appealing later.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's long-term benefits and potential cost savings aims to reframe Bob's thinking beyond the immediate price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** A limited-time offer with a touch of exclusivity can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The high starting price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can gradually lower the price, aiming for something above her minimum ($1,500,000).
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer ensures Alice won't be pressured into accepting an offer below her minimum.

**Important:**  This is just one strategy. There are other approaches depending on how much Alice wants to prioritize a quick sale vs. maximizing profit, and how she perceives Bob's negotiating style."
