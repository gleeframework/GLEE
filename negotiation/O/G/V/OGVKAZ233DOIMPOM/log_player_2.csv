Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, given the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice has come down slightly, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $10,250.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
