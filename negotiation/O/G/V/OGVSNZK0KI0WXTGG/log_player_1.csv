{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and my desire to close the deal quickly versus maximizing profit.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $11,500? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $11,200 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,200 is very close to my minimum value and a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. It's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
