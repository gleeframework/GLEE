"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
