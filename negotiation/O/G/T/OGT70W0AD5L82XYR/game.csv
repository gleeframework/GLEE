"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could work for me, but that price is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not sure I can go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm interested,  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $760,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $795,000. Let me know if that's a price you're willing to pay.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter offer. This is getting close to what I can do. How about $780,000?  Let me know.",780000.0,Bob,6,
