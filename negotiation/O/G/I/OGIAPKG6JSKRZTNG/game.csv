"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $950000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",920000.0,Bob,4,
