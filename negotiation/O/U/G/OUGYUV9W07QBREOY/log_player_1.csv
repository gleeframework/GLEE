Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving Room:**  If Bob rejects, I have room to negotiate down without going below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll always keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a compromise between his offer and my minimum price. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  My counteroffer of $110 is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects again, I can still make another counteroffer, potentially going even lower.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't settle for an unacceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's offer is a strong incentive:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is much better than Bob's offer. 
* **Possibility for a better deal:**  Even though Bob is willing to meet me halfway, I still have room to negotiate further and potentially get a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring that I don't end up selling the product for less than I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  Let's try $115. It's closer to your offer and still leaves me with a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $115 is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining profit:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize that the offer ""leaves me with a decent profit"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Last chance for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response carefully and be prepared to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer.
* I'll focus on achieving a deal that is both profitable for me and acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. How about $100? That's my absolute max. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price without further negotiation.
* **Potential for further haggling:** While I could make another counteroffer, there's a high chance Bob will remain firm at his $100 limit, leading to a lengthy and ultimately unprofitable negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale, securing a guaranteed profit.
* I'll learn from this experience and adjust my negotiation strategies in the future."
