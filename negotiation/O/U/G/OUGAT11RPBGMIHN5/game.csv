"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
