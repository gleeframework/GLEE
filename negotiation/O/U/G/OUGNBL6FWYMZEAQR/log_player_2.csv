"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $90 is less than John's price, you know you can get the product for a maximum of $100. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
