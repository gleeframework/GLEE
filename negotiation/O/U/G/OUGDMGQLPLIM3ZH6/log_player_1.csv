Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $200, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've sold the product at a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I won't get a better price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's good that he's interested, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $120 is simply too far off.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This will give me a better chance of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize that my counteroffer is still a good deal for him, framing it as a ""meeting in the middle"" solution.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"" This encourages Bob to respond and keep the conversation going.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a fair deal while still making a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer again. If his counteroffer is still too low, I may decide to sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher. I'm not interested in continuing this negotiation further, and I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely.

**Next Steps:**

Since John is willing to buy the product for the same price as Bob's final offer, it makes sense to sell to John. This ensures a quick and straightforward sale without further negotiation."
