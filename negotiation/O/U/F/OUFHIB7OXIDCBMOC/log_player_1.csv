"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly serious about purchasing the product. If he's willing to pay a significant amount, it's a good sign. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 9 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It's a good starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have enough rounds left to try and get a better price, and I can always fall back on selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer. It's a good starting point for the next round of negotiations and shows I'm willing to negotiate while also staying close to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have enough rounds left to try and get a better price, and I can always fall back on selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is getting very close to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. It's a serious offer showing I'm committed to making a deal with Bob, while still leaving room for some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but I only have two rounds left, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept my next counteroffer. Given the limited time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing if Bob continues to refuse to meet my price."
