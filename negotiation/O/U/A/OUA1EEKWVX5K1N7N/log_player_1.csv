Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm not giving away too much value. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable, and this price gives him some room to negotiate while still providing me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. $105 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $110 is still a good profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be a good compromise and Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still below my threshold of $120.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
