"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $800000.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1000000.
