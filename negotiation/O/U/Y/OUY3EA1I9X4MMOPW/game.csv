"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While that price is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation, and I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
