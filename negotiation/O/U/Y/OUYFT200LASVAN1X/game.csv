"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make another small concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",815000.0,Alice,7,
