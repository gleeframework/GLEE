"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value our potential deal, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
