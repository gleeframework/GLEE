"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

Round 6
