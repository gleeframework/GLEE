"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a significant investment, but it's a valuable asset with a lot of potential.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both room for a profitable agreement.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I still need to consider my minimum price.  Let's meet at $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing me to cover my costs. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me and my financial constraints.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,400,000.
