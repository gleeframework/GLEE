"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you in the middle at $10000, Bob. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it work. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
