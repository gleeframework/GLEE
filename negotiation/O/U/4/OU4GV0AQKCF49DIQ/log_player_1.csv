Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, you're setting a high anchor. Even if Bob doesn't agree to this price, it might make your eventual target price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches John's standing offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and you have the advantage of knowing his initial offer is already at your minimum acceptable price. By rejecting and countering, you might be able to secure a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This tactic can feel fair to both sides, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $1,400,000  is still a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,300,000 is a substantial profit above your minimum acceptable price, representing a $100,000 gain compared to John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield smaller increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the uncertainty of further back-and-forth."
