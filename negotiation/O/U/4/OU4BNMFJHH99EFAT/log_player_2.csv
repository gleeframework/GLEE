"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to give us room to negotiate. We'll see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. Would you consider $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer, but still aiming for a price below my maximum. This shows Alice I'm serious while leaving space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm aiming for a price that acknowledges the real value of this product. How about $15,500? This is a small adjustment, but I believe it's fair considering what you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very close to John's price, but I think there's still a chance to get a slightly better deal. I'll try one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is a really nice product, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,250? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14250
}
``` 

This offer splits the difference between our last two offers. It keeps us below John's price while hopefully being enticing enough for Alice to accept."
