"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still a significant amount, and Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Would you be open to discussing this further?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of 1050000. Would you be open to considering this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, potentially getting closer to his desired goal of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. I can offer you a price of 1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is a good price for Bob.  He is only $25,000 away from his desired $1,000,000 price point. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might not budge, and he could risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer is a good move for Bob, as it secures the product at a reasonable price."
