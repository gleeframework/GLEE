{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a better price. $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  We have 10 rounds, so we have time to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a bold counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly.  A $200,000 reduction from her initial price is a reasonable starting point. If she rejects this offer, we can continue to adjust our price based on her responses."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than my initial counteroffer.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  We still have 7 rounds left, so there's time to explore further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible. This offer is a halfway point between her last offer and my previous one."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not quite there. We have several rounds left, and I'm confident that we can negotiate a better price. I'll continue to counter-offer and see if we can close the gap."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,062,500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still not willing to overpay. This is a compromise that could be attractive to her."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and we are running out of time.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my next offer and ultimately ending up buying from John is too high.  $1,070,000 is a good price, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the deal."
