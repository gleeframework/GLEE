"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
