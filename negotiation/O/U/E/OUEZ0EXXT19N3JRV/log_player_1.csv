"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to reach a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential"" and ""significant returns"" adds perceived value to justify the high initial price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This first offer is ambitious but not outrageous. It allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate while keeping the option of John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product, Alice. While I understand its value, I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he increased his offer, it's still more beneficial to continue negotiating and try to bring him closer to your desired range. You have John as a reliable backup if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  This product has the potential to generate substantial returns for you, far exceeding your initial investment. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Strong Stance:** You acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but reiterate the product's value and your higher valuation. 
* **Strategic Movement:**  You make a substantial concession ($300,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, you remain firmly above his valuation and closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Potential:** You continue emphasizing the potential returns to keep Bob focused on the long-term benefits, justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the potential value of the product, I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Reduce his offer:** He could become less willing to move higher.
* **Walk away:**  He might decide the product isn't worth further negotiation.

Accepting the current offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
