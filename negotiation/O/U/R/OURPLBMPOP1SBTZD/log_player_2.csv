"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  Could you consider $1,850,000? This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can continue negotiating to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,850,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're making a serious offer at $1,200,000.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,500,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, it's clear that they are unlikely to reach an agreement.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is the best option to acquire the product while staying within his budget."
