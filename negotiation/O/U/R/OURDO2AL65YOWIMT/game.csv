"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price. However, I have to consider the value this product holds for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. Would that be workable?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
