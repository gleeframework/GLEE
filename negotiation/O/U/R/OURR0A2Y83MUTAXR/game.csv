"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. This is a great price considering the value it will bring to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $16500? This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another offer. How about we meet at $15000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy it from you if we can agree on this price.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $16000? This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, and that's the final offer I can make. I hope we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
