"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to let you have it for $125. This is a one-time offer, so if you're interested, let me know quickly! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $125 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $150 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in further negotiations."
