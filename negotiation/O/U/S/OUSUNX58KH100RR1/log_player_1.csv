"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($18,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I subtly emphasize the product's value to me, hoping it influences Bob's perception.

This strategy allows for potential counteroffers and gives me a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $14,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $14,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  There's room to negotiate closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:** While John is a safe option at $15,000, I'm not in a desperate situation. I'm going to try to squeeze more out of Bob before settling with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Within Range:** $16,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm highlighting the product's worth again, aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on reaching a mutually agreeable price.

This approach balances firmness with flexibility, keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,500, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $15,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it would guarantee a successful deal.
* **No Incentive for Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob, and further negotiations could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Offer is Equal:** While John offers the same price, Bob's counteroffer is a sign of genuine interest.  

It's important to balance getting the best price with the risk of losing the deal entirely. In this situation, accepting Bob's offer secures the minimum acceptable price and prevents potential further negotiation complications."
