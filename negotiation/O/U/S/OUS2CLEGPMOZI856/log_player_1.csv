Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to incentivize him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys openness to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still allowing for a potential mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($80).  There's potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I can offer a price slightly higher than $100, aiming for a mutually agreeable deal closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $100 is a fair offer, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be. How about $110? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Value:**  $110 is still a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Framing:** I emphasize the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the benefit of acquiring it at this price."
