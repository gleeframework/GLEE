"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, leaving some room for negotiation while still getting a good price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Note:** I'm not mentioning John yet.  I want to see how Bob reacts to my initial offer before involving a potential alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly less than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Not yet time for John:**  While selling to John is an option, I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to that. 

**Next Steps:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap but not giving away too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's fair for me as well. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential savings at this price.
* **Framing:** I'm framing $13,000 as a ""great deal"" for Bob, playing on his desire for a good price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potentially reaching an agreement in this round.

**Note:** I'm still not mentioning John yet. I want to see if this counteroffer is enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about $12,500? That's a good compromise for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has come up a bit, $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **John remains an option:** Selling to John for $10,000 is still a viable option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll send another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This gives you a good deal, and it's more in line with what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price point that's above my minimum.
* **Finding middle ground:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm trying to reach a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more to him, so $13,500 is still a great deal.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not giving in too quickly, showing that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 

**Note:** I'm still holding off on mentioning John. I want to see if this counteroffer can close the deal."
