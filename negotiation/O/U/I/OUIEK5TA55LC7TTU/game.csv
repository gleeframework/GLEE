"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll find the product's value will far exceed this price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair price that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?  I think that's a fair offer and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a reasonable deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
