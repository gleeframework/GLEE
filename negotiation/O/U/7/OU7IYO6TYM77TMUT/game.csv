"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget, I'd be happy to pay $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
