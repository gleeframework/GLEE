"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your target price, but you can still potentially save more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to your target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm still a bit high at $92.50.  Let's split the difference and go with $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $97.50, but I was thinking we could meet at $97.50 and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about we call it a day at $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you'd ideally like to pay closer to $90, Alice's offer of $97.50 is still within your budget of $120.  Additionally, she's offering ""extras"" which could potentially add value to the product.  It's a good compromise, and accepting avoids further negotiation."
