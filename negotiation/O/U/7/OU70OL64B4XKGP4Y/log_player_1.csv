Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.  
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation. This helps to build rapport and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he rejects outright, I know I need to lower my price more aggressively. 
* **Initiate the negotiation:**  By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm creating space for him to counteroffer, allowing me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired $120.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes too time-consuming, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $85 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's initial offer, it's still a sign that he's interested in the product. I can try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, so there's no immediate urgency to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to go down to $95, which still allows for some profit on my end.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $95, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value, suggesting that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price, which is important to me.
* **Friendly tone:** The message remains friendly and open to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $90 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject this offer and try to counter again, there's a chance Bob might walk away entirely. 
* **Time factor:**  While $90 is not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential to lose the sale if I reject. 

**Overall:**  It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer of $90 seems like the best option at this point to avoid losing the sale entirely."
