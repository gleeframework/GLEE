{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language to build rapport and highlight the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end the message with a question, inviting Bob to engage in further discussion. 

This strategy allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value while remaining open to Bob's counteroffer if he's not willing to pay the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  
* **I want to try to negotiate a higher price.**  I believe I can likely get closer to $120 or at least above $100, which would be a better deal than selling to John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $90 is your current limit. While I can't go down to that price, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a counteroffer that is in the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:** I provide a justification for my counteroffer by emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Open-ended question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to maintain some leverage while showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price.  
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** The negotiation is progressing. Bob is showing interest, and I believe there's still room for a compromise that would be more profitable for me. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point, potentially getting a price closer to $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This would be a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $100 is exactly in the middle between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($95). This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Finality:**  I phrase my message in a way that suggests this might be my final offer, putting a bit of pressure on Bob. 

This strategy aims to close the gap, potentially leading to a successful sale at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to pay $90, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob is firm at $90, and he's even mentioning an alternative buyer, indicating he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Below Minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $150, which is significantly more than Bob's final offer.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, accepting his offer would be a loss for me. Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum price and get the best possible outcome."
