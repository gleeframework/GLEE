"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's within my budget, and it allows you to make a profit. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
