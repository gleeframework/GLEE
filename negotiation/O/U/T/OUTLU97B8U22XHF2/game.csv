"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we aim for $9,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9250.0,Bob,4,
