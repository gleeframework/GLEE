Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to my initial valuation of $1,200,000. Let's start there and see if we can find a happy middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.
