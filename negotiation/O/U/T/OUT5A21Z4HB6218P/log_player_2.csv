"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you've already placed on it. Let's start the negotiation off strong!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum price, so it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to my initial valuation of $1,200,000. Let's start there and see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a price closer to your initial valuation, but I need to make a profit on this.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This gives us both a little room to be happy with the deal. What do you think?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his target, it's still above his maximum price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
