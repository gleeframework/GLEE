"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the initial offer I made. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the product's value to me and the market demand. I'm willing to consider $12500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $12500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $10500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
