Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a high price but also leaving room for a potential compromise.  It also  signals to Bob that you are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  Rejecting this offer allows me to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $125, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112.50 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I am hoping to get closer to my desired price, so I will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to go up to $115, but no higher. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. At this point, it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  I'm better off selling to John for $150, which ensures I get my minimum value."
