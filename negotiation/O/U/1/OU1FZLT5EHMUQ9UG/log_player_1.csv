Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation and making the offer appealing. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** You're stating the price and inviting Bob to respond. 

By starting with this offer, you open the negotiation and see how Bob reacts.  You can adjust your strategy based on his response and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value I know the product holds for Bob. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** It shows Bob I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Explore a higher offer:** I can try to push for a price closer to my initial $1,400,000 or potentially even higher.
* **Get a better understanding of Bob's limits:**  His counteroffer provides more information on his budget and willingness to negotiate.

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little to $1,350,000. This is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,400,000.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still above Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000, ensuring I get a better deal than selling to John.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm  communicating my willingness to negotiate while reaffirming the product's value.

This counteroffer positions me for a potential win-win scenario. It demonstrates flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 higher than what John is willing to pay. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. 

Given the time and effort involved in further negotiation, selling to John immediately offers a quick and certain profit.  While it's not the highest possible price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the potential risks of further negotiations."
