"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item for a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Bob can reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John, effectively getting the same product for the same price."
