"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'm offering $10,200. I hope that's a more reasonable price for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,4,
