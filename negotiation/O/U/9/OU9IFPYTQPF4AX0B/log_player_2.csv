"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better deal.  A counteroffer gives you the chance to secure the product for a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal.  I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my budget, and we've been going back and forth for several rounds. At this point, the risk of further negotiation not resulting in a lower price is too high.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and guarantees a lower price."
