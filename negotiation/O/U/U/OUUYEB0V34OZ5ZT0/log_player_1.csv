"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. It's worth $150 to me, and I'm not willing to sell for $80.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $120?  It's still a good deal for you, considering what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's valuable to you Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the maximum he is willing to pay, and it's equal to the value of the product to him.  While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product and get a decent profit.  I'm not willing to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is willing to pay $150."
