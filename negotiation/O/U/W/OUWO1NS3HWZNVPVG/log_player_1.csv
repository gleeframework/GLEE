Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net.  This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,100,000) to allow more room for bargaining.
* **Relationship Building:** The message emphasizes a ""mutually beneficial deal,"" which can help foster goodwill even if Bob counter-offers."
