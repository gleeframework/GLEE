"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to her. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, we can start a counter-offer process and aim for a price closer to our ideal target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for me."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than the initial $600,000, it's still below our target. We can continue negotiating for a better price. We're still better off rejecting the offer and trying to get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming up to $650,000, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to pay $675,000. This price is closer to what I can afford and still allows you to make a good profit. Let's meet in the middle to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 675000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $675,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $660,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $660,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price, and at $660,000, we're saving $140,000 compared to buying from John.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and the time constraint makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
