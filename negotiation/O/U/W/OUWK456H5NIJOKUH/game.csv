"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming up to $650,000, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to pay $675,000. This price is closer to what I can afford and still allows you to make a good profit. Let's meet in the middle to finalize this deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $675,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $660,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",660000.0,Alice,5,
