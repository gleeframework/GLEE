"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum value for the product. It's better for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value to me and the potential for us both to benefit from a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than that. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value it holds for you, while also being a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000. However, it's a significant improvement from her previous offer of $1,400,000.  

Considering the potential for further negotiations to drag on, and the possibility of Alice becoming less flexible, accepting the offer now is a good decision. It allows Bob to acquire the product while still staying within a reasonable price range."
