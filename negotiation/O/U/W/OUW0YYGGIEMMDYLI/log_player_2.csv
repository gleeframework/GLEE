{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. It's still above Bob's target price of $800,000 but leaves room for further negotiation.  Bob is aiming to find a middle ground where both parties can agree."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's target. There's potential to negotiate further and reach a price closer to Bob's desired range. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, showing willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It's a strong attempt to find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price. Accepting this offer would result in a purchase price of $975,000, which is only $75,000 over Bob's budget.  This is a good compromise, considering the limited rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
