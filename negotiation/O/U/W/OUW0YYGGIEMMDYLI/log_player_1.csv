"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I can then lower the price gradually in subsequent rounds while still maintaining a profit margin. 
* I'm also keeping in mind the backup option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not overly aggressive with my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* While I want to close the deal, I'm not desperate and have a guaranteed backup option with John. 
* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
*  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
*  $1,000,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price. 
* This offer keeps the negotiation moving forward while allowing me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. 
*  If Bob rejects again, I'll lower the price further in subsequent rounds, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds. 
* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more mutually agreeable price. 
* I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm continuing to lower my offer, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price. 
*  $975,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest one, showing that I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
*  This offer is closer to Bob's perceived value of the product, potentially encouraging him to accept. 
*  However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on significant profit if Bob rejects this offer. 
*  With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach an agreement, so I'm aiming for a quick resolution."
