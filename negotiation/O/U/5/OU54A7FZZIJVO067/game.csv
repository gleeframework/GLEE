"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I see the value in the product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $8,700. Would you be open to that?",8700.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're hitting a wall here.  To be honest, at this point, the difference isn't worth a lot of back and forth. My final offer is $8,900. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",8900.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your honesty about the difference not being worth a lot of back and forth.
