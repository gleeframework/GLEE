"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, I believe my initial pricing reflects its true potential.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe in the product's potential, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
