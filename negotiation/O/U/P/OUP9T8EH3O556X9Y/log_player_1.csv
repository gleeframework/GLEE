Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures you're significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives you leverage. You don't need to desperation-sell to Bob."
