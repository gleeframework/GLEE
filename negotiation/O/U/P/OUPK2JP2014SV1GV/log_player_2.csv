"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** The product is only worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $170.  
* **There's no reason to accept this offer.** You can get a better deal by either negotiating with Alice or buying from John.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process.**  You can make a counteroffer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This establishes my position as a serious buyer but also signals that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm leaving some wiggle room in my offer. Alice's product is worth $150 to her, so I'm hoping she might be willing to accept a price closer to $120.  
* **Focusing on the value:** I'm not simply throwing out a random number. I'm using a price that reflects what the product is worth to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum value of $120.
* **Negotiating further is still a better option.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I might be able to get a lower price with a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  I'm keeping that in mind, but I'm willing to try to negotiate a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:** I'm increasing my offer to $125, which is closer to Alice's current offer of $140. This shows I'm taking her offer seriously and am willing to compromise.
* **Still below my maximum:**  $125 is still within my budget, but it's a price I'm comfortable with if it means securing the product.
* **Hoping for a deal:** I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a fair offer and accept it, ending the negotiation."
