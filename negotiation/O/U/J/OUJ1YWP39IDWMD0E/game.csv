"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I'm not willing to go below $11000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500, which is $9750. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
