"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Is this something you'd like to consider?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $140. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $135. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
