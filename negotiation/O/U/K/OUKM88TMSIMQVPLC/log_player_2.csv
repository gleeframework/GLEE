"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for a price of $15000. It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, you can try to negotiate with her for a lower price. If you reject her offer, you can then buy the product from John for $15,000."
