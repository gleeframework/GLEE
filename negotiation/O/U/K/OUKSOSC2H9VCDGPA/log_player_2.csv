"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $115 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price.  You can try to negotiate with Alice or see if John will budge on his $120 price."
