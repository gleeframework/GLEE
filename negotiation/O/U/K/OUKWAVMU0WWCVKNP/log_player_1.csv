Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us.  How about we start the conversation at $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting high to provide room for negotiation while still staying well above Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrasing ""start the conversation"" signals that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Value-based language:**  By mentioning that the product would be ""incredibly valuable"" to Bob, I'm subtly reminding him of its potential benefits, even if he doesn't value it as highly as I do.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having a good chance of securing a deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
