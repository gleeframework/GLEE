"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would still leave you with a good deal, and I'd be happy to close the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
