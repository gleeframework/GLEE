"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident it will bring you great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad you like it! However, I'm afraid I won't be able to accept your offer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $980000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid $980000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is there any room for negotiation?",950000.0,Bob,6,
