"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,500.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,750?  This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $15,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I'm counteroffering at $16,250.",16250.0,Alice,5,
