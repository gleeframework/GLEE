Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $900,000. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. After considering the options, I've decided to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll counteroffer to Bob with a price of $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial offer was lower than my initial offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is still lower than my target price, but I'm not willing to sell it to him at that price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll counteroffer to Bob with a price of $825,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's previous offers were lower than my target price.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm not willing to sell it to him at that price yet. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll counteroffer to Bob with a price of $820,000. This is a small increase from his previous offer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to get him to meet me in the middle.
