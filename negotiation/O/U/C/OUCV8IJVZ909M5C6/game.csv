"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,100,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your specific needs.  Would you consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
