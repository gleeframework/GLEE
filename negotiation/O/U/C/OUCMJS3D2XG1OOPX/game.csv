"Bob, I understand your offer, and appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
