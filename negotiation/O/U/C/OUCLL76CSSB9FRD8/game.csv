"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable for your business. My starting price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows me a fair profit, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go any lower than $935,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $935,000, so I'd like to propose a price of $927,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",927500.0,Bob,6,
