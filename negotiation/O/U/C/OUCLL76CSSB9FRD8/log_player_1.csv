"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $800,000, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my ideal price.  I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go any lower than $935,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $935,000, so I'd like to propose a price of $927,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $927,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $927,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $927,500 isn't my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable amount, and with only four rounds left, I risk losing a significant amount of profit if I keep rejecting offers.  It's important to weigh the potential for higher profits against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
