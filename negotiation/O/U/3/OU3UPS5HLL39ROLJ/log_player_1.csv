"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting with a high offer ($2,000,000) well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a strong position.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how flexible he might be during the negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I understand its value, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to negotiate closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly his perceived value and significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a better price. There's room to work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I have John's offer gives me the confidence to reject low offers and push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate. However, the new price is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum and leaves room for further adjustments.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""market value"" emphasizes that my price isn't arbitrary and adds weight to the offer.
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** I'm avoiding language that makes the product seem less valuable, even while negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This represents a good profit margin, even though it's less than my initial target.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has consistently and strategically worked his way up from his initial offer. This indicates he's serious about the purchase and unlikely to move significantly higher.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a profitable deal and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
