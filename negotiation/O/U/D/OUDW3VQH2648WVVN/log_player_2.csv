Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $105. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk Alice not budging further."
