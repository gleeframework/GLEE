Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so anything over that is pure profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. This is his upper limit, he won't pay more.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Consider these factors:

* **Bob's urgency:** How badly does Bob need this product? 
* **Relationship:** Is a future good relationship with Bob valuable? 
* **Risk Tolerance:** Are you willing to risk the deal falling through for a higher price?

**Sample Offer (Aggressive)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This leaves room for negotiation but signals your strong position.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value"" might push Bob closer to his upper limit.
* **Time Pressure:** Creating urgency can prompt a quicker decision.

**Important Notes**

* **Be prepared to negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer. Have a strategy for concessions.
* **John as leverage:**  You don't want to explicitly threaten Bob, but subtly reminding him of other buyers can be useful. 
* **Alternative Offers:** You can adjust the price and message depending on your risk appetite and desired relationship with Bob."
