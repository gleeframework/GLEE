Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer sets a starting point at $1,000,000. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, giving me room to negotiate.  It also leaves enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a better deal. By rejecting, I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to maximize my profit. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, giving us both an opportunity to compromise."
