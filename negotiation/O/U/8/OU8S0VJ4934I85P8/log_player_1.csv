Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $150 but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $170. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $165 is a decent amount and it's unlikely Bob will budge much further. It's also better than selling to John for $150."
