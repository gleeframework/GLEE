"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $100, but it's worth seeing if Alice might counter with a lower price, closer to her $80 value."
