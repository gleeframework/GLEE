""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so any offer above that has the potential to be accepted.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000. This is your fallback option.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you want to offer a price that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but low enough that he'd prefer it over losing the deal. 

**The Offer:**

By offering the product at $1,400,000, you're aiming to:

* **Secure a Significant Profit:** This price point gives you a profit of $600,000 over Bob's valuation.
* **Maintain Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but you have a strong starting point.
* **Avoid Losing the Deal:** If the price was too close to $1,500,000, Bob might be less inclined to risk negotiating and could walk away."
