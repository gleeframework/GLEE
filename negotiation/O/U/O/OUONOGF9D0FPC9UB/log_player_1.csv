# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'm willing to hold out for a higher price for a few more rounds."
