"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product,  $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, would you be open to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and agree on $13000?  This would allow us both to walk away happy.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $14000, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $13250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal. What do you say?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and the value of the product. I'm counteroffering at $13750. This is as low as I can go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,7,
