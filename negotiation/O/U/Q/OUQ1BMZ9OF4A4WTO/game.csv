"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $925,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,,
