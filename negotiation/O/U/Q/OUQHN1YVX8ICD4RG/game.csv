"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's still a great deal for you, and allows us both to make a profit.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting my financial limits.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's still a profitable deal for both of us. I'm hoping you'll consider this final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $750,000? It's a fair compromise that allows me to acquire the product while acknowledging its value to you.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which is still a very good price for you considering the product's worth. This is my final offer, let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,7,
