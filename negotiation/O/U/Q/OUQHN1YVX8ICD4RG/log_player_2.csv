Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's still a great deal for you, and allows us both to make a profit.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which is still a very good price for you considering the product's worth. This is my final offer, let's make this happen.

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's offer of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option with John and continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of not resulting in a better deal."
