"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18000. Would you be open to that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $22000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $20000. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",20000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $20000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $21000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",21000.0,Alice,5,
