Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might raise suspicions or limit potential gains. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more involved and potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Backup plan:** Alice is secure knowing John will buy the product at her desired minimum ($1,500,000) if Bob declines. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
