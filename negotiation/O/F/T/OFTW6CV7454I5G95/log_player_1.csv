"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the value Bob will be getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8400. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,400 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $8,800.  Rejecting his offer again keeps the negotiation going and gives me another chance to make a counteroffer.  It's important to note that if I were to accept Bob's offer at this point, I'd only be earning $400 more than what I'd get from John.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm going to meet you halfway on this one and offer $8,600.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to offer $8300. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get him to come up a little more.  If I were to accept his offer, I'd only be getting $300 more than what I'd get from John.  I'm hoping for a bit more, so I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to compromise. Let's split the difference and go with $8,450.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8450}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $8200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm starting to run out of time and negotiation room.  I've already rejected his offer twice at this price, and he's clearly not budging.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000.  There's a chance I could get a little more from Bob in the next round, but the risk of a failed negotiation and a lower sale price is not worth it."
