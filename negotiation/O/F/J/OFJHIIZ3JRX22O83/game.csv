"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm aware of its potential worth to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's more than fair, considering its potential.  Let's discuss a price of $1,400,000.  This would leave us both with a significant profit, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
