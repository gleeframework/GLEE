"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10000 is my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11000?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
