Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're still earning more than your minimum.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:**  By including a message, you're inviting Bob to engage in a conversation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $115 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing,  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between our desired prices.  Hopefully, this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'll offer you $108.  If we can agree on that, I'll take it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's only $2 below my minimum, and Bob seems to be firm on his price.  It's not worth risking losing the sale and having to sell to John for a lower price."
