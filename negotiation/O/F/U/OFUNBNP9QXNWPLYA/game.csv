"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
