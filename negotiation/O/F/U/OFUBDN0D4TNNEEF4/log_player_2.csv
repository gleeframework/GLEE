"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not interested in paying $18,000. That's way above my budget of $10,000. I'll reject the offer and look for a better deal.
