# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
You're looking for a price lower than $800,000, so rejecting the $1,400,000 offer is the logical first step. You'll need to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise we both feel good about.

While $1,200,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's still room for her to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. It's a good compromise for both of us.

While $1,050,000 is a decent compromise, it's still above your goal of saving as much money as possible.  You're still closer to John's price, and you have a good chance of getting Alice to come down a little further."
