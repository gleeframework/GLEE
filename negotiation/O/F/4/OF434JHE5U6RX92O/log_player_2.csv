"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the potential it holds, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $13,500. This is an exceptional opportunity considering its true worth of $12,000 to you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's true worth to her ($15,000), it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $12,000 is the best option to achieve his goal."
