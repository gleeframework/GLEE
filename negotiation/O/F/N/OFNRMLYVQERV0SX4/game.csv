"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. I'm confident we can work out a mutually beneficial deal.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $80, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
