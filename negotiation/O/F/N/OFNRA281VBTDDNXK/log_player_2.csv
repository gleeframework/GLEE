"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit your business. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price.  He has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so he has leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while I can acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a new offer of $900000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000.  This is still above the product's worth to her, but it's closer to Bob's ideal price.  Bob can either accept this offer and save $100,000 compared to buying from John, or he can risk another round of negotiations, potentially leading to a lower price, but also risking a stalemate or Alice walking away.

Given the risk and the fact that $900,000 is within Bob's budget, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
