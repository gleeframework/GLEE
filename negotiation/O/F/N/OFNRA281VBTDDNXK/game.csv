"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit your business. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a price of $850000. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while I can acquire the product within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a new offer of $900000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
