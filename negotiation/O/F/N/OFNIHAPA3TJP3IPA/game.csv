"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will benefit you greatly. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. Considering the value of the product to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me is $10000.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500, as it's still below my minimum price. Considering the value of the product to you is $10000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm surprised you're willing to go as high as $12500, but I still think that's too much. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,6,
