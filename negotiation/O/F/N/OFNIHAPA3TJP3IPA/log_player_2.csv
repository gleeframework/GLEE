Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. Considering the value of the product to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.
