Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $100 for this deal. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs, and I'm hoping you'll agree.  What do you say?
