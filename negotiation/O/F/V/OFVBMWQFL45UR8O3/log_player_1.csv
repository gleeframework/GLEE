"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $95? It's a fair price that's closer to my limit, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $100 for this deal. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs, and I'm hoping you'll agree.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
