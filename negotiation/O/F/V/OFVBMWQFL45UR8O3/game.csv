"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $95? It's a fair price that's closer to my limit, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $100 for this deal. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs, and I'm hoping you'll agree.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
