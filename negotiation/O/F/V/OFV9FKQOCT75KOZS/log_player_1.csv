Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $19,000. I know this is a premium price, but I believe the value it provides makes it worthwhile. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value.
* **Anchoring:** Offering $19,000 initially sets a psychological anchor. Even if Bob wants to negotiate down, it's likely the final price will be closer to $19,000 than if you started at $15,000.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (John). This takes pressure off securing a deal with Bob, allowing you to be firmer on your price.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, consider factors like Bob's personality and your long-term relationship goals. If you prioritize a quick sale or building goodwill, you might adjust the initial offer downwards."
