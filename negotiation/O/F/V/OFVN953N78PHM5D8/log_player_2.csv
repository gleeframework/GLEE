Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a slight improvement from the previous round, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a lower price and am willing to risk one more counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, I've made multiple counteroffers and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
