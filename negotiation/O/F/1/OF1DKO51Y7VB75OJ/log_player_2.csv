"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Consider this a special offer, as I'm prepared to sell it to another buyer for $1,500,000 if you decline. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob can still get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
