This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe you'll be thrilled with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you can get a better deal from John for $800,000. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
