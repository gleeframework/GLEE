"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, at $13,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll see the potential and be willing to negotiate. It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I don't need to settle for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product for my minimum value of $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us - it's my minimum and still offers some potential profit for Bob. I'm hoping he'll see the value of the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm going to compromise a bit and offer the product for $11,500. This is still above Bob's last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a good deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is unwilling to go higher than $11,000, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  Rather than risk further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for my minimum price.  This ensures I get the value I need and avoids any further risk."
