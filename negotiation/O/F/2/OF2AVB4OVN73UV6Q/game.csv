"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a significant offer and shows I'm genuinely interested. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I have to consider my minimum selling price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your own minimum price.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product. I'm now offering it to you for $835,000. This is my final concession, so I expect a serious response.",835000.0,Alice,5,
