"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally under $800,000.
* Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's budget. 
* It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a significant offer and shows I'm genuinely interested. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Bob starts with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for the lower price, emphasizing his interest and making it a serious offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $750,000 is still a good deal for Bob, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I have to consider my minimum selling price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:** Bob has the option to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  While Bob could buy from John for $800,000, it's worth seeing if a deal can be reached with Alice at a lower price. There's a risk Alice might reject Bob's counteroffer and he might end up with no deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your own minimum price.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob moves closer to Alice's offer but still remains within his budget. This shows he's serious about the deal.
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes this is Bob's final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept or lose the deal.
* **Justification:** Bob reinforces his reasoning for the price, appealing to the value both for him and Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $825,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product. I'm now offering it to you for $835,000. This is my final concession, so I expect a serious response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $835,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $800,000.
* **Finality:** Alice emphasizes this is her final concession, meaning further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** There's a risk that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice might not counteroffer again, and Bob might have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While Bob could potentially get a lower price, the chance of securing a deal at a price just $35,000 above his target is worth considering."
