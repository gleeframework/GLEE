"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I'd like to counter with a price of $115 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $110.  This feels like a fair price that benefits us both.",110.0,Bob,4,
