"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final counteroffer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $950,000. If you're able to work with that, I think we have a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you a price of $980,000, which is a reasonable compromise between our last offers. This is my final compromise.",980000.0,Alice,5,
