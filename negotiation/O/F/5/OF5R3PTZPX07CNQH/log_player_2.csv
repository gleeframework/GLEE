Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final counteroffer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you a price of $980,000, which is a reasonable compromise between our last offers. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than this.  While you could try for a bit less, saving $20,000 isn't worth the risk of the deal falling apart."
