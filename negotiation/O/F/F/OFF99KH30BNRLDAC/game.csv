"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While your product is quite interesting, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you can't go as low as $7,000, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $8,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a compromise that still gives you a good deal on the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
