**Reasoning:** Alice seems firmly stuck around the $9,000-$9,500 range.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get her much lower. It's better to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid the risk of Alice staying firm, which would cost us more time and potentially end up with us paying close to John's price anyway."
