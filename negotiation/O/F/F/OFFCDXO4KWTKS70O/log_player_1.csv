{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll try to counteroffer with a price in between."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
