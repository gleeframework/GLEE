"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely do better.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, knowing that Alice is likely to counter. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation and shows that Bob is serious about getting the product at a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is a good compromise. It's still a decent price for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum budget of $12,000, and it's also a fair price for Alice, since it's above her minimum of $8,000. It's likely that further negotiation would result in a smaller price reduction, so accepting the offer at this point is the most logical choice for Bob."
