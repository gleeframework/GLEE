"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. I want to maximize my profit, and this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I have time and rounds left, so it's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more. With multiple rounds remaining, I aim to gradually get closer to my target price without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,200.  While I was hoping for more, with only 6 rounds left, I'm risking losing too much time trying to get a few hundred dollars more. Selling to Bob at this price ensures I get a good return, and it's a better option than selling to John at $8,000."
