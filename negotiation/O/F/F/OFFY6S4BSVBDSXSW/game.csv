"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I think it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of this product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,250 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that considers the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
