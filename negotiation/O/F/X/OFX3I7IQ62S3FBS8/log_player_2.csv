Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have other options, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $150. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get something more substantial. How about we meet at $165? That's the best I can do.

It's clear Alice is not going to budge below $155.  Since you can get the product for $150 from John, it makes more sense to go with that option and save the $5."
