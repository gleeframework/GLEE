You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if he can get closer to his $10,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's value of $10,000 as possible.  A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within Bob's budget. This should incentivize Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if he can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's moved slightly higher from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. However, he's still well below Alice's current offer, hoping to incentivize her to come closer to his target price."
