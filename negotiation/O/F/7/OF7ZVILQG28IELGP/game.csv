"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",112.0,Bob,4,
