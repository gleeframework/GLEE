Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to get at least $12,000, so this offer gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a fair starting point:** The offer is a reasonable compromise, making it more likely Bob will consider it.

Remember, this is just the initial offer. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and your desire to maximize profits while still potentially selling to John for $12,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a good price, it's still below your ideal selling point.  You're likely to get a better offer if you counter.  Bob clearly sees the value in your product and is willing to negotiate, so rejecting his counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're not accepting his price immediately, showing that you're firm on your value.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:**  You're showing flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **It's closer to your desired price:** $13,500 is still closer to your goal of $14,000 than Bob's offer.

Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John if Bob continues to decline.  But by continuing to negotiate with Bob, you have the potential to maximize your profit."
