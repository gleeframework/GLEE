"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for a counteroffer since Alice is willing to sell for as low as $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this and make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's $1,500 less than John's price and only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's a chance Bob could get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, but the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially increasing the price again is high.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
