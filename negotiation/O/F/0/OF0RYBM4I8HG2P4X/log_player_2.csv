"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob! I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $115.**  This is still below Bob's maximum of $150.
* **Further negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will stick to her price or even increase it.
* **Opportunity cost:**  If Bob rejects this offer and keeps negotiating, he risks Alice becoming less willing to sell, or he could end up having to buy from John at $150.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer at $115 is the best option for Bob.  It saves him money compared to buying from John, and it's likely the best price he'll get."
