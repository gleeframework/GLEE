Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario where both parties feel they got a good deal."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer to $1,150,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm lowering the price a little bit more, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this encourages Bob to accept the offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."

While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not guaranteed.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
