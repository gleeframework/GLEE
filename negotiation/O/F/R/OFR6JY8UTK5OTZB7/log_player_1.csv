"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justifying the Price:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Alice, it emphasizes its ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high asking price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains amicable and invites Bob's perspective, setting the stage for a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a higher price with Bob, it's risky. Here's why:

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob clearly stated $1,500,000 is his upper limit, and he's already ""meeting halfway."" It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Each round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost. Accepting John's offer provides immediate closure and eliminates uncertainty. 
* **No Guarantee with Bob:** There's no guarantee Bob will budge, and you might end up with a lower offer or no deal after further rounds.

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the safest option, guaranteeing you reach your minimum acceptable price."
