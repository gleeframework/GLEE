"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
