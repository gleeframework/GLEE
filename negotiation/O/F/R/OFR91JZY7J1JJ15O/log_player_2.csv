"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her value of $800,000. This suggests room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm eager to close this deal, but $907,500 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  How about we meet in the middle one last time and agree on $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally wrap this up.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer of $915,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield small concessions. Considering the limited rounds left and my desire to save as much money as possible, I'm choosing to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. While this price is higher, it guarantees a purchase within the remaining rounds and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
