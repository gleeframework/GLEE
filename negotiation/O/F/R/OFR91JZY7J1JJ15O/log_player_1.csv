Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value the product holds for me. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $800,000. What do you think?
