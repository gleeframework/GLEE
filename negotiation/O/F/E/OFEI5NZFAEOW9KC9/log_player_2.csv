"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if we can get a price closer to $8,000.  We always have the option to buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but slowly. We're still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. It's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $8,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $8,750, which is $9,125. I think that's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price we like, but we're still not there yet. We're halfway through the rounds, so let's make another counteroffer and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,125 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $8,900? That's a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are."",
""product_price"": 8900
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to making a decision. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's worth it for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems to be holding firm, and $9,000 is a reasonable price.  It's a good deal compared to John's offer, and we're running out of rounds. It's best to accept now and secure the product at this price."
