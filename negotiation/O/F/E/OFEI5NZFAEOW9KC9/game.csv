"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $8,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $8,750, which is $9,125. I think that's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,125 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $8,900? That's a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to making a decision. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's worth it for the value this product brings.",9000.0,Alice,7,
