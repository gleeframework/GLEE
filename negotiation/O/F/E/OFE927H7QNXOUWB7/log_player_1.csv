Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground, indicating he's willing to pay a significant amount. We're still above John's offer, so the risk is relatively low.  We'll push a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to accept $900,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is likely getting close to his maximum, and we're reaching a point of diminishing returns with further haggling.  This offer meets his previous counteroffer, putting the ball firmly in his court and showing a desire to close the deal.  By stating it's our final offer, we create a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now gone below our fallback price with John.  While there's a chance Bob might go higher, his consistent halving of the difference suggests he's unlikely to significantly exceed $850,000. Accepting his offer risks leaving a significant amount of money on the table, and further haggling might alienate him.  John represents a guaranteed $800,000, which is a reasonable outcome in this situation.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed profit."
