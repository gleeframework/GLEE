"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? ",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $725,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $825,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $737,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",737500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, but $737,500 is still not quite there for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,7,
