Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $725,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground.
