"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  This is a fair price considering your asking price and the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  This product is valuable to me, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to prioritize getting a fair price for it. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14,500. This is a compromise, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is closer, but it's still a bit above what I can afford.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $13,250 is still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $14,000 is still too much for me. Let's meet halfway again and settle on $13,500. I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",13750.0,Alice,9,
