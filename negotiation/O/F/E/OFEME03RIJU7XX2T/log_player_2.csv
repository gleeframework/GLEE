# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13500, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my budget, though it's closer to my maximum. I can still try to negotiate a lower price, as I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to walk away at this point and get the product from John for a guaranteed $10,000.  There's a risk that I might get a better deal if I continue negotiating with Alice, but the potential savings are not worth the risk of going over my budget."
