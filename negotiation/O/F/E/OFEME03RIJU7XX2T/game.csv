"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you sharing the value of the product. While it sounds interesting, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13500, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise, I appreciate it. While $13500 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $11500 for it. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
