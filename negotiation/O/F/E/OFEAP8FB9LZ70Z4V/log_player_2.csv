I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,062,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.

You should buy the product from John. Alice is not budging from $1,062,500, and you are only $62,500 away from your target price.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially since you have a guaranteed option at your target price with John."
