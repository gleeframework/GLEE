,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is as high as you're willing to go, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'll meet you at $132.50. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",132.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $132.50. I'm willing to go up to $129.50, that's the best I can do. Can you meet me there?",129.5,Bob,6,

"I understand that $129.50 is the best you can do, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'll meet you at $129.00. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",129.0,Alice,7,
