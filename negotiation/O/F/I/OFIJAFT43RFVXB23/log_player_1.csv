{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum selling price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $10,000 is a significant profit for Alice, considering her minimum is $8,000. 
* **Appeal to Bob:** The price is below Bob's estimated value, making it attractive.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

By offering this price, Alice is setting a strong starting point while keeping the door open for potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still far below the potential profit Alice can make.  There's room for negotiation to push the price closer to her desired $10,000 mark.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Alice to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good value considering what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It splits the difference between Alice's previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain profit:** $9,250 is still a significant profit for Alice, closer to her initial goal.
* **Appeal to Bob's reason:** The message highlights the fair value of the price and emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob.

By offering this counteroffer, Alice demonstrates flexibility while also protecting her own financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $9,250 is a fair compromise, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's initial goal was $10,000, Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000.  It's also close to the middle ground that Alice offered in the previous round.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
