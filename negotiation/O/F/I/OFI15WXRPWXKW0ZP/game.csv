"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price and I'm open to further discussion.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to your offer, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $925,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. Let's meet in the middle at $912,500.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still too high for me. I'm proposing we meet at $893,750. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's get this done!",893750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $915,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $904,375. This is a fair compromise that I'm willing to accept.",904375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $904,375 is still a bit high for me. I'm proposing we meet at $899,062.50. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs.  I'm confident we can close this deal right now.",899062.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $907,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",907500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $907,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $901,250, which is a fair compromise, considering the significant concessions I've already made. I'm ready to close this deal right now if you're willing to accept.",901250.0,Bob,10,
