"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $120 matches John's offer, it's important to remember that the product is worth no less than $120 to me. Accepting Bob's offer would mean I gain nothing from the negotiation.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
