"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
