"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}

I'm starting with a price of $180, leaving some room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $160, still above my minimum price of $150, to hopefully find a middle ground with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price again to $155, hoping that Bob will see that we're close to a deal and accept this offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $152, which is more than what I could get from John ($150). While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation."
