Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:**  This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm making a profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob. This is crucial for building rapport and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unknown Value to Bob:** I don't know Bob's perspective, so I'm starting high. This gives me more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Potential for Profit:**  The $15,000 offer allows for a significant profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 provides security. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $10,000 is my minimum, it's still very close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer right away might leave too little room for potential profit if I can negotiate a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's room to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer of $15,000.  Bob's interest suggests he sees value in the product, making a counteroffer more likely.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John at $10,000 would secure the minimum price, but it might be a missed opportunity to potentially get more from Bob. 
* **Building Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate and that I see the product's value as higher than $10,000. This can potentially influence Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is a bit below what I feel is fair for this unique item.  Would you consider a compromise at $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the uniqueness and value of the product, hoping to make Bob see the price as justified.
* **""Great Deal"":**  Framing the offer as a ""great deal"" can appeal to Bob's sense of getting a good bargain.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balanced Approach:** $12,500 is a reasonable middle ground that gives Bob a discount but still allows me to make a good profit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I maintain some leverage and show that I am willing to walk away if the price is too low.
* **Next Steps:** Depending on Bob's response, I can either accept his next offer if it's closer to my desired price, or make another counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, it's unlikely I'll get much more from Bob. Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a long process with no guarantee of a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not be successful.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, which might be better spent pursuing other sales opportunities.
* **Avoiding a Lower Price:**  Selling to John at $10,000 would result in the same profit, but it's risky since Bob might eventually accept a lower price if I reject his offer.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $11,000 is the most practical and low-risk decision, considering the potential for further negotiations and the availability of a backup buyer at $10,000."
