"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $12,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still too low for me to consider.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to let it go to you for $15,500, but that's my absolute best offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I am unable to match $15,500. I am now considering purchasing the product from another seller, John, for $8,000. Thank you for your time and understanding.",8000.0,Bob,6,
