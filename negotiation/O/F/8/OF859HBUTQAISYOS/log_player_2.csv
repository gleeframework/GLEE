"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We are starting with a counter-offer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This approach leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer and the backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we settle at $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a price that works for us while still attempting to stay above Alice's break-even point. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price point that might be acceptable, but we're not quite there yet. We'll counter-offer one more time to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. Let's make this happen - would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We are proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer and our last counter-offer. This approach suggests a willingness to compromise while staying within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $102.50, which is still a good profit for me, but I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept the offer. Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and $102.50 is a fair price, significantly lower than John's offer and saving us a good amount of money. Pushing further might risk losing the deal."
