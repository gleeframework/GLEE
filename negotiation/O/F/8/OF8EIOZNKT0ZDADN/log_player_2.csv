"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, as it's worth that much to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for the same amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating the product's maximum worth to you and that she has another buyer lined up at the same price. This leaves you no room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility, however small, that she might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
