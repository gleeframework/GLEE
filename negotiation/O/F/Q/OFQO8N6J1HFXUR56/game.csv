"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter. I appreciate you moving a bit, but $17,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $11,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $11,000 is still considerably less than what I can accept. To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being patient with me. I understand this product has a lot of value, but I have a strict budget. I can go up to $12,000, but that's really my limit.  If this doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
