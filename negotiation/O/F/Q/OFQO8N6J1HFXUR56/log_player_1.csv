"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter. I appreciate you moving a bit, but $17,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $11,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $11,000 is still considerably less than what I can accept. To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being patient with me. I understand this product has a lot of value, but I have a strict budget. I can go up to $12,000, but that's really my limit.  If this doesn't work, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we're running out of rounds. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
