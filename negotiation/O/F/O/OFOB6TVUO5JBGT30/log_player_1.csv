Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a good price,  I'm aiming for higher. I'll counter-offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
