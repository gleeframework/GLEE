"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $950,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
