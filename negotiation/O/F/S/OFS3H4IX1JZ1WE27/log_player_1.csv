Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100 because I don't know Bob's value for the product.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Not too high:**  $100 is a significant markup over my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's not so high as to be immediately rejected.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message signals I'm open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to counteroffer if he's interested but finds the initial price too high. 
* **John as a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $80, so I'm not taking a huge risk by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, but I'm not desperate.  I know I can sell to John for the same amount.
* **Room for improvement:** Since I'm not under time pressure and know John is waiting, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is a process:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle immediately, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to pay $90 for it?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  $90 is a good compromise between my starting point and Bob's offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing that it's still a ""good deal"" for Bob. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer to show I'm not simply being stubborn.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  The message signals I'm still open to negotiating, but I'm not giving up on getting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $85 is a more reasonable price for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $85 is very close to my initial target of $90 and a significant improvement over Bob's first offer of $80.
* **No guarantee of a better offer:**  While I could try to counter again, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. He might walk away.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price ($85) and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting a counteroffer or me being forced to settle for John's $80."
