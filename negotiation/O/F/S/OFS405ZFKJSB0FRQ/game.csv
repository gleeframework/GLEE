"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, but I can't go any lower.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $11000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10500. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $10500 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $10750, as a final compromise. Let's close this deal and both of us can walk away happy.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10400, but no higher. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. $10400 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you one more time at $10600. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me one more time, but I'm still not comfortable with $10600. I'm willing to go up to $10400, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to compromise.",10400.0,Bob,8,
