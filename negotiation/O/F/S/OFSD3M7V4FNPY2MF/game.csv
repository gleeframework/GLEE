,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand that $120 is a bit high, however,  $60 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $90 is still a bit steep for me. How about $70? That feels like a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm willing to be a bit flexible, $70 is too low. How about we split the difference again and settle at $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Alice,5,
