"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You can get the product for $125 from Alice, which is cheaper than the $150 John is asking. 
* **You are willing to pay up to $150.** Even though Alice's offer is $125, you would be happy to pay more (up to $150), so this is still a good deal."
