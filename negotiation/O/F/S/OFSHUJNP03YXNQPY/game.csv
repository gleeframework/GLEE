"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  That's still a great deal for a product this valuable.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm open to continuing to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $115?  This is a fair price for a product this good, and it allows me to get closer to my goal.",115.0,Alice,5,
