"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for us to close a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",10500.0,Alice,3,
