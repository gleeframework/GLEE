"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's close to my maximum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, which will hopefully encourage her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below my bottom line.  Could you do $13,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject the offer and counter again, aiming to get the price closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product. However, I'm staying below my $8,000 limit with John.  This should put more pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
