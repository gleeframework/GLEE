"I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I think this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John if we can't come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
