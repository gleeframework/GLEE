Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $850,000 is a good price, and it's much closer to my initial goal than selling to John.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
