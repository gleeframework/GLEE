"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd get great value from it. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it allows me to get a good deal as well.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance I can get a better price by either negotiating with Alice further or going with John's offer."
