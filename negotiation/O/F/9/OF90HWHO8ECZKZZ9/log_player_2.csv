{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but there's significant room for negotiation. It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. It shows that you are serious about getting a good deal, while also leaving room for compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than what I'd like to pay. There's still potential to negotiate a better price, and I don't want to settle for something that's too close to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go as low as 700,000.  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but it also leaves a little room for her to come down further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but I can still get a better price from Alice. I will continue to negotiate with her before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also demonstrating that she won't go below a certain price point. My last offer of 850,000 was rejected, so I need to increase it slightly to show that I'm serious about reaching a deal. This offer is still within my budget, but it also demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm getting closer to a deal. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  I can still get a better price from Alice, and I'm not ready to give up on that potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly pushing for a higher price, but I'm confident I can get a better deal. My last offer of 900,000 was rejected, so I'm slightly increasing it to 950,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit more.  It's a good balance between pushing for a better price and avoiding a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm not yet ready to give up on negotiation. There's still a chance to get a lower price, especially since we're nearing the end of the rounds. Rejecting this offer allows me to make one last counteroffer and try to get a better deal before I have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise that meets Alice halfway. We've both been willing to negotiate, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to close the deal at this price, but if Alice rejects it, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
