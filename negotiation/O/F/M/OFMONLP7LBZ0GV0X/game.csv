"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $170 might have been optimistic, $80 is significantly less than what it's worth to me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $130 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?  That's a fair offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still quite low, but I'm ready to close this deal.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
