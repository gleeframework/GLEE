{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** While not my ideal price, it's a good starting point.
* **Initiate the negotiation:**  This gets the ball rolling and gives Bob a concrete offer to consider. 
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** The price is not too high to immediately turn Bob away."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

* **Maintain my negotiating position:**  It shows I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. 
* **Explore potential counteroffers:**  I can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Assess my options:**  If the negotiation doesn't progress, I can always sell to John for my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This gives you a good deal, and I can still make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm bridging the gap between our positions with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate and emphasizing the benefits of the offer for both of us. 
* **Maintaining my position:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum price, showing I'm not desperate.

* **Encourage a deal:**  The counteroffer is more likely to be accepted than my initial offer.
* **Stay within my acceptable range:**  The price is still within my minimum acceptable price range.
* **Signal flexibility:**  Demonstrating a willingness to compromise increases the chances of a successful negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I am open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low. It is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even my last counteroffer of $11,000.  

By rejecting his offer:

* **Maintaining my position:** It demonstrates that I am not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.
* **Continuing negotiation:** It gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Assessing my options:** If the negotiation doesn't progress, I can always sell to John for my desired price.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness and value of the deal, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Urgency:** By saying ""Let's make this happen,"" I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

* **Create pressure:**  The urgency in the message might influence Bob to accept the offer before it's too late.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can we make a deal?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have only 4 rounds remaining, and selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable option. 

By rejecting this offer, I can:

* **Maintain my negotiating position:** It shows Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price for my product. 
* **Explore a final counteroffer:**  I have one more round to try and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Assess my options:** If the negotiation doesn't progress, selling to John remains a strong alternative. 

I'm willing to consider a final counteroffer that reflects a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum."
