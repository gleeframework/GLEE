""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify a higher price than the $1,000,000 Bob might expect.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he rejects it, you can always negotiate down or move on to John."
