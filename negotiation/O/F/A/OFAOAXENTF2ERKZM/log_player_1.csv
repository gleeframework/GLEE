Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done my research and I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $975,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you seriously consider my previous offer of $975,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While I'd like to get more, Bob is signaling he's firm on his price. Accepting his offer of $975,000 is a significant profit and better than risking him walking away and settling for John's offer of $800,000."
