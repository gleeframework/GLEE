"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,000. This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to recoup some of my costs. Let's meet in the middle!
