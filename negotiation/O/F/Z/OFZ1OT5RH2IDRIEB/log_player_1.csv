"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you while still allowing me a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I was thinking it could be a bit lower. I'd like to propose $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my target price and my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to try and reach a more favorable price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but I think we can do better. I'd like to propose $920,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm not going to sell to John yet as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $980,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 980000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but I'd like to propose a condition: if you accept this price, I'd like you to throw in a 6-month warranty and a dedicated support package. This would be a great value-add for me, and I'm willing to meet you at $950,000 if you're willing to include these extras. If not, I'm willing to go as low as $920,000 without the extras. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not willing to add the warranty and support package for that price.  It's a significant added cost and commitment on my end. I'm hoping to get a higher price for the product, even without those extras. I'm not going to sell to John yet as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you offering the additional services, but they're outside the scope of our initial agreement. I'm willing to stick to the product itself and offer you a price of $970,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 970000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to pay $950,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm confident I can't get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  While it's less than what I initially hoped for, I need to be realistic and secure the deal.  I'll accept his offer and move forward."
