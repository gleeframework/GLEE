# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails."

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay and what you can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
