,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $140, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,5,
