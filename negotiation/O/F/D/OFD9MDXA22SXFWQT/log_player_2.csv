# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You are willing to pay $12,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000.  You can get the product from John for the same price. There is no reason to accept Alice's offer."
