"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product holds considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps aim for $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you consider $13,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product. I hope this offer meets somewhere in the middle for us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
