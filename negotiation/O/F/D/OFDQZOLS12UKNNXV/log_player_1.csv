{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach maximizes my potential earnings while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it seems unlikely Bob will offer more.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $95."
