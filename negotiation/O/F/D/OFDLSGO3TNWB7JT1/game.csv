"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
