"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high, but I've got to make a profit. I can do $165 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the quality and value it offers.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more than $155. I can meet you halfway at $160, but that's as low as I can go.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155 again?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made it clear that I won't go below $160, and you've already offered me $155 twice. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'll meet you at $158. That's my final offer.",158.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $158 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $152?",152.0,Bob,8,
