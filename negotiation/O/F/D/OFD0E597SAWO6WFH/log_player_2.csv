"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me think about it for a moment... Ah, I've got it! I'll meet you at $1,030,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price and only $5,000 away from Bob's last counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and Bob having to buy from John is too high. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a good price."
