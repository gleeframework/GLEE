"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  Would you be willing to go up to $92.50?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $91?",91.0,Bob,6,
