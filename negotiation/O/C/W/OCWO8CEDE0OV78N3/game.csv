"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000. How about we try $1,520,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
