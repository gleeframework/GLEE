Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $1,000,000 (her backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit margin of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to capture as much of that $500,000 margin as possible.  Here's an offer that balances profit maximization with a reasonable chance of acceptance:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strong Profit:**  Alice secures a $350,000 profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Appealing to Bob:** Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than his perceived value, a significant saving. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on Alice's risk tolerance and how aggressively she wants to negotiate."
