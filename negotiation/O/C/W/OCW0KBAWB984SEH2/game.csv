"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in purchasing it for $900,000. This seems like a fair price considering your own value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's try to close this deal. ",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  $935,000 feels like a more reasonable price for both of us, considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal! ",935000.0,Bob,6,
