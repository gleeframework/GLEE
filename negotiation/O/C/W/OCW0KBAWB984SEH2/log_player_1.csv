{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's something you'll find extremely valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in purchasing it for $900,000. This seems like a fair price considering your own value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still below my minimum, and I have time to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet because I'm still within my negotiation rounds and have a chance to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  $935,000 feels like a more reasonable price for both of us, considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal!  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum, and I'm getting close to the end of my negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and being forced to sell to John for a lower price."
