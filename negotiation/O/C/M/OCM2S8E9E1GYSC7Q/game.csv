"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a great price for you, and I could make it work on my end.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
