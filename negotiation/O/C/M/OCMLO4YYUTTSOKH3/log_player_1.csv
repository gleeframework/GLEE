Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive messaging:** Using positive language encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to counteroffers, but I have a backup buyer (John) ready if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd prefer. I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Room to bargain:** I have some room to lower the price a bit more and still make a decent profit. 
* **John as a backup:**  John's offer of $150 provides a safety net if I can't get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm lowering my price from $120 to $105, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Still above my minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Enthusiastic language:** Using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""close this deal"" emphasizes a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of losing Bob:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I may end up selling to John at a lower profit.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I accept this offer, there's still a possibility that I can convince Bob to increase his offer slightly in the future."
