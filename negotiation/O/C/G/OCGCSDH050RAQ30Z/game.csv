"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $950,000 to see if we can find common ground.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to show my commitment to finding a deal. Let's split the difference and see if we can make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but $875,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000 as a final compromise. This price is still significantly below what I'd like to get, but it shows I'm determined to make this deal happen.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",925000.0,Alice,5,
