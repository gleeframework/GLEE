"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product for me. However, $11000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $10500. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11200 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10850? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",10850.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $10850 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,5,
