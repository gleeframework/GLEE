"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can save $1,000 by negotiating with Alice. While the product is worth $12,000 to you, you can potentially get it for less. Rejecting the initial offer allows you to counter-offer and explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product for me. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your initial counter-offer, there's still room for negotiation. You can still save more money by rejecting this offer and making another counter-offer. You're confident you can get it for lower than $11,200, as your initial counter-offer was $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,200 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,850? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 10850}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10850 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a final offer of $11,100. This is still $900 more than your initial counteroffer of $10,200, but it is a significant reduction from her previous offer of $11,200. You can save $900 compared to buying from John, which makes accepting Alice's offer the most advantageous choice."
