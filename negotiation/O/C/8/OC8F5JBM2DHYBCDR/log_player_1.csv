"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob interested. I am not willing to go lower than $150, as that is my minimum acceptable value.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. While I'd love to sell the product, I'm not willing to lose that much money. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price is appealing enough for Bob to consider, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable value. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  Let's close the deal!"
