"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on the positive aspects of the deal and emphasizing the value Bob will get. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room for a counteroffer, but still aiming for a price that is profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's room for a counteroffer, and I can potentially get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my initial offer. How about $90? It's still a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-propose with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and aiming for a win-win situation.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  $90 is still higher than Bob's desired price, leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $82? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, $82 is still lower than the $120 I need to make a worthwhile sale.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  Even though Bob claims it's his lowest, there's still room to push for a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is my fallback option:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $120.

I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I need to make sure I get a price that is at least close to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $82 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $86? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but not conceding:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility but not going below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Splitting the difference:** Suggesting to split the difference is a common tactic that makes the offer feel fair and reasonable.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm reframing the negotiation as finding a mutually beneficial price, rather than simply pushing my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $86 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $86, which would be $84. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $84 is close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk settling for a price that's too low.
* **John is a secure option:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum price, which is important given the limited time.

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to be strategic and prioritize my desired profit.  If Bob doesn't come up to a reasonable price, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $84 is still not quite enough for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise.  How about $88? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make the price seem more justifiable. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  Implying this is my ""last compromise"" adds a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time and low offer:**  We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offer of $85 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a high risk of not reaching a deal, leaving me with nothing. 
* **Secure Option:** Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, which is a much safer and more profitable option at this point. 

I've tried to negotiate with Bob in good faith, but it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that meets my needs.  Therefore, selling to John is the most logical choice."
