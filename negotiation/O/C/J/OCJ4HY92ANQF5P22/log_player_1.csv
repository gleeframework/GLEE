Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's value of $80.** This gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.** This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It's a round number.** This makes the offer easy to understand. 

The message is friendly and provides a reason for Bob to accept. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I need to try to get closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price of $120, $90 is a decent compromise.  It's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and the negotiation has taken some time.  At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer and move on."
