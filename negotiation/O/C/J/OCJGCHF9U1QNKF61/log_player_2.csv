"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  You can potentially save more money by negotiating further. You have a good buffer, knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and Alice values it at $800,000.  This gives you room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price given its worth to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable price considering Alice values the product at $800,000.
* **Focus on Shared Value:** The message emphasizes the mutual benefit of a deal at this price, appealing to Alice's desire to make a sale. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by inviting Alice to continue the discussion, signaling your willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially considering the benefits it will bring you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still well below your maximum price of $1,200,000, allowing you to save a substantial amount.
* **Compromise:**  Alice has met you halfway, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While this is a good deal, it's still possible that with further negotiation you could get the price even lower. However, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially walking away exists. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic choice at this point. You're securing a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
