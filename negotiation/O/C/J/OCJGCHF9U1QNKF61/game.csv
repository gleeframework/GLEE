"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price given its worth to both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially considering the benefits it will bring you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
