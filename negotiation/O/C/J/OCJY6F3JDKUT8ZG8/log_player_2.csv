"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think that's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This approach aims to bring the price closer to my desired range while gauging Alice's willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your feedback, Bob. Considering your offer, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about $100 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'll counter-offer again to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm inching my offer up slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering the value you see in the product, how does $97 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down considerably, and $97 is a reasonable price, especially considering John's offer of $150. It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal from Alice at this point."
