# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget of $100.  It's best to reject and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, hoping Alice will be willing to come down a bit. It's a bold move, but I need to make it clear I'm serious about buying the product while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, $125 is still above my budget. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can push for a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my $100 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $110. If you're willing to meet me halfway there, we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price closer to my budget, while still acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit.  By emphasizing my commitment to buying the product, I hope to encourage Alice to see the value in closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I can come down to $115. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $115 is still above my budget. I want to try and get a better price. I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating, but keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer, but I'm still just a little over my limit.  Would you be willing to meet me at $110?  I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my last offer of $110, hoping that Alice will realize it's close to her minimum and a good deal for both of us. This shows persistence and might make her feel the pressure to close the deal.  If she rejects, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer."
