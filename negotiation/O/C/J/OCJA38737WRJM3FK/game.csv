"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $110. If you're willing to meet me halfway there, we can make this happen.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I can come down to $115. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer, but I'm still just a little over my limit.  Would you be willing to meet me at $110?  I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,6,
