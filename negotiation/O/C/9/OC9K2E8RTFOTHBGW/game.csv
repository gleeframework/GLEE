,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I can't go lower than $102.50. That's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you.  Let's close this deal!",102.5,Alice,5,
