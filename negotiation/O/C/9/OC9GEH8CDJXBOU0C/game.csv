"Alice, your product seems great, but your price is a bit higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1400000 is just too low.  How about $1600000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you were willing to come down to $1500000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
