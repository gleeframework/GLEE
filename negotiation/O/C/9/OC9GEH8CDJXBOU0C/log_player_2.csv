# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1750000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's a good idea to explore negotiation, you should aim for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget.  You should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price, potentially closer to your target of $1,500,000."
