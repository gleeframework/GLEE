"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:** $120 is significantly more than $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaves room for a potential counteroffer:**  This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, even if he needs to counteroffer. 
* **Provides a clear and concise message:**  Keeps the communication simple and focused. 

Remember, the goal is to earn as much money as possible, but also to avoid a situation where Bob rejects your offer and you end up having to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John for $150, we can still likely get a better deal. Bob has acknowledged the product's value by offering more than his initial assessment of $80. By rejecting his offer, we can leverage his interest and attempt to get closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting our own interests.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product and the potential savings for Bob strengthens our position.
* **Clear and Direct:**  The message is clear and concise, making it easy for Bob to understand our expectations.

By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer and offering a price that's closer to our desired amount, we're showing that we're serious about getting a good deal but also willing to be flexible. This sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer of $90, it's still below our desired price point and below our minimum value for the product.  We need to push for a higher price and continue to leverage our position by:

* **Demonstrating flexibility:** We've shown willingness to negotiate by making counteroffers.
* **Maintaining our minimum price:** We are not willing to sell below $150, so rejecting this offer keeps that line clear.
* **Avoiding the ""Sell to John"" option:** If we continue to reject Bob's offers, we have the power to potentially get a better deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, we can continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a price closer to our target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer. While I can't go as low as $95, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  We're again demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value Reiteration:**  We emphasize the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Closing Language:**  ""Let's finalize this deal"" subtly pushes Bob to accept and move forward.

By proposing a middle ground price at $100, we're showing Bob that we're serious about closing the deal. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that balances our desire for a good profit with the need to reach an agreement before the deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you at $97.50, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $97.50 is still below our desired price point, it's getting dangerously close to our minimum value.  We need to weigh the risks:

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Bob might refuse again, leaving us with a smaller window to sell and potentially having to accept John's offer at $150.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob walks away, we might not find another buyer quickly.
* **Time constraints:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, so time is running out.

Considering these factors, it's strategically wise to accept Bob's offer. This secures a profit and prevents us from potentially losing out on a sale entirely. While $97.50 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
