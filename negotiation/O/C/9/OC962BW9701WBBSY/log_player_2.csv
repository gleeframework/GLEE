# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to save some money. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'm not sure if $90 is the best deal I can get. I'll reject Alice's offer for now.
