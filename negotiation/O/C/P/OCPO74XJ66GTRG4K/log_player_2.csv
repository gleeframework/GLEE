"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm looking for a price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. Her starting offer is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $20,000 is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. "",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful of Alice's position but clearly states our budget limitations.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is significantly below our $12,000 walk-away price, giving us bargaining power if Alice counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is quite far from what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $18,000 would be more reflective of that.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice came down, but $18,000 is still significantly higher than our target and our walk-away price.
* **More Negotiation Needed:** We have time and room to negotiate further. It's unlikely Alice's best offer is her second one. 
* **John is an Option:**  We have the safety net of buying from John at $12,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but staying below our $12,000 walk-away point.
* **Budget Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the budget constraint to manage Alice's expectations.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The message aims for a collaborative tone to encourage Alice to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $16,000 is better than her previous offer, but it's still $4,000 more than we can get it from John.
* **Time to Leverage John:** Alice seems to be coming down in larger increments now. It's time to signal we have other options and might walk away. 
* **Not Our Last Offer:** We haven't reached our maximum price yet, but we need to be careful not to go over."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** We're letting Alice know we have a viable alternative, adding pressure to her side.
* **Final Offer (Almost):**  $11,500 is a strong signal that this is close to our maximum. We're leaving a little wiggle room in case she counters. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  Even though we're using a bit of a negotiation tactic, we're keeping the tone respectful and expressing a preference to work with her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your honesty.  I understand you've found another option, but I truly believe my product is superior, and I'm willing to make one final offer to prove it. I can't go below $14,500.  It's a great price for the value you're getting, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,500. Even though it's a better price than her initial offers, it's still significantly above our $12,000 alternative.
* **John's Price is Guaranteed:**  We know for sure we can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and we risk missing out on John's deal if we continue.
* **Time is a Factor:** We've used up several rounds, and there's a chance Alice might not budge much more.  It's better to secure the product at a good price than risk ending up with nothing after 10 rounds."
