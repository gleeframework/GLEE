Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm looking for a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $20,000 is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is quite far from what I had in mind.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?
