"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm aware that Bob might make a counteroffer, so I'm not setting the initial price too high. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me the flexibility to either accept a decent offer from Bob or walk away with a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is willing to pay $130, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  However, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, I can signal that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I can use that as a bargaining chip in my next counteroffer to Bob.

In the next round, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, perhaps $135, to see if I can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal for both of us, and it gets you closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that it's still a ""great deal"" for him, even at $135, to highlight the product's worth. 
* **Focusing on Budget:**  I'm addressing Bob's concerns about his budget by suggesting a price that might be more manageable for him.

By offering a price that's closer to his offer, I'm increasing the chances of a successful deal while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think $130 is still a fair price for both of us. Could you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and gives me leverage for a final counteroffer.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to start thinking about the value of closing the deal versus potentially getting a higher price.  I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation.
* **Potential for Counter-Counteroffer:** I believe I can still nudge Bob up to $135 with a final counteroffer in the next round.

I'll counter with $135 again, emphasizing that it's a fair compromise and the best deal for both of us. If he rejects it, I'll have to weigh the risk of selling to John and missing out on a potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's be realistic - $130 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm still willing to compromise. How about we settle at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last counteroffer before I seriously consider selling to John. I'm sticking with $135 as it's a decent compromise, but I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" and the importance of closing the deal to incentivize Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is the ""final"" offer. This might push Bob to reconsider and accept the deal.
* **Compromise vs. Risk:**  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to decide between accepting his offer and getting $130 or selling to John for $150.  This will depend on my risk tolerance and how much I value closing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I truly appreciate your flexibility. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $130. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the final 5 rounds. 
* **No Further Compromise:** Bob is firm on $130, and I've already made two counteroffers. Further negotiations are unlikely to change his mind.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit of $30, which is better than the $10 profit I would get from selling to Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price in the next few rounds, it's not worth the risk of not closing a deal at all.  Selling to John ensures a safe and guaranteed profit."
