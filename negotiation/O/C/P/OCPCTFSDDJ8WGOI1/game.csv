"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but no higher. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,6,
