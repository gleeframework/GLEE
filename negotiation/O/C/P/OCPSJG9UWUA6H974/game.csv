"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me and considering the opportunity cost, I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $850,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $800,000. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
