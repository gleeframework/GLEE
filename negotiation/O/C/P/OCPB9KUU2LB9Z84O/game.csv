"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I'll sell it to you for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
