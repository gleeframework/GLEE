Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $20,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's also important to remember that:

* **The value to Bob is unknown:** This means there's no guaranteed ""best"" price. We're aiming for a good balance between maximizing our profit and ensuring a sale.
* **The John safety net:** We have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so we can be more assertive in our negotiations with Bob. If Bob won't meet our expectations, we can always go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $15000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is the minimum we're willing to accept, we can try to push for a higher price. Bob's offer is still within our acceptable range, so there's no immediate need to sell to John. Let's see if we can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $15,000 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $17500. How about we split the difference and settle on $16250? It's a fair price that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,250 is a good compromise. It's higher than our minimum acceptance price and within our acceptable range. Accepting this offer allows us to close the deal with Bob and avoid the potential risk of further negotiations."
