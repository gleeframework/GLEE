"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to accept the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While I'm aiming for the highest possible price, I want to leave room for Bob to counteroffer and keep the negotiation going.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. However, I'm choosing to engage with Bob first as there's a chance I can get a better price from him through negotiation. I'll evaluate my options as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value:** I need to earn at least $1,200,000. While Bob's offer is higher than his first, it's not enough for me to accept.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob.  
* **John is a backup:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 remains an option if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

**Next Steps:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This reflects the product's true value and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's true value, implying that $980,000 is a fair price.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** The message is still positive and encourages Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:** I'm still aware of the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. However, I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate with Bob, I can get a better price for the product. I'll re-evaluate my options as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $960,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  The gap between our offers is narrowing, and I'm not sure if I can get much higher with my next counteroffer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  With each round, the opportunity to sell to John for a better price gets closer. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be more cautious and assess the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price. I'm also seriously considering selling to John if the next round doesn't result in a significant improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While your offer is getting closer,  $960,000 just doesn't work for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $970,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a fair offer.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that we ""close the deal."" This might push Bob to make a final decision.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that I'm running out of rounds, and I'm starting to consider the option of selling to John. However, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'll carefully evaluate my options in the next round depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I think we're making progress. I would like to counter with an offer of $965,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:**  We are now very close to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Still below my minimum:** $965,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **High risk of counteroffers:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a high chance that he will make another counteroffer that's only slightly higher, leaving me with a minimal profit and little time left to negotiate.

**Conclusion:** It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale to John.  While I would have preferred to get a better price from Bob, the risk of ending up with a less favorable outcome is too high."
