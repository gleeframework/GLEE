"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, and I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product for both of us. I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
