Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum of $800,000.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while also ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept."
