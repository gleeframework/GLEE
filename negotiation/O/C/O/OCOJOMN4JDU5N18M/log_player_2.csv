"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and Alice's first offer is exactly $150, there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price, even if it means risking losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer,  lowering the price by $20. This shows Alice he's serious about getting a better deal and is willing to negotiate.  $130 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $150 to $140, meeting Bob halfway.  Bob is looking to spend as little as possible, but $140 is still within his budget and a decent deal. Accepting this offer saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John."
