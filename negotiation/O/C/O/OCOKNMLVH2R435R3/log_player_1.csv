I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try and get a bit closer to my ideal price before considering selling to John."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's also only $10,000 less than my last counteroffer, so it's clear that we are both getting closer to an agreement. With only 4 rounds left, I think it's more beneficial to accept his offer and close the deal."
