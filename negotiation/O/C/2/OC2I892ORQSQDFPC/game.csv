"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a firm offer, as I'm confident I can find other interested buyers at this price point.",900000.0,Alice,3,
