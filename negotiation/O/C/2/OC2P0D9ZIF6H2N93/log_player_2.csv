"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $175. I'm confident you won't find a better offer for this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $175 is better than $200, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price again. You're still hoping to get it for your maximum price of $100, but you might be willing to go a bit higher if it's the only way to secure the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $125 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $150 is still above your maximum budget of $100. You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice has made a counteroffer, so further negotiation is unlikely to get you the price you want.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100."
