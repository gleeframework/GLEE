"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value to incentivize him to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $135 still leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary, while also giving me a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport and increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is higher to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** While $120 is the product's value to Bob, I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective,  $120 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $128? This still leaves me with some profit, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $128, I'm still taking a loss compared to my minimum value of $150. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm using open-ended questions to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $125. This allows us to stay within my maximum budget while providing you with a reasonable profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is always an option, I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $126.50?  This is just a small adjustment, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 126.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still seeking a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Progress:** I highlight that this move gets us closer to a deal, suggesting a positive trajectory in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended Question:** I use an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose a price of $126. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with your adjusted price while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $126 is still below my desired price of $150, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and there's a risk of losing the deal if I reject it. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are nearing the end of our allotted rounds, and it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.

**Overall:** Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  It's a good balance between maximizing profit and closing a deal within the time constraint."
