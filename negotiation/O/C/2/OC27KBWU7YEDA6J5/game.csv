"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is higher to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective,  $120 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $128? This still leaves me with some profit, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $125. This allows us to stay within my maximum budget while providing you with a reasonable profit margin.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $126.50?  This is just a small adjustment, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",126.5,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose a price of $126. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with your adjusted price while staying within my budget.",126.0,Bob,6,
