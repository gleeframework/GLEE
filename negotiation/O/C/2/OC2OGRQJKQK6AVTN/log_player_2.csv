It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're out of time:** This is round 9, leaving only one round left. If we reject this offer and Alice counters, we're likely stuck with a price higher than this or forced to buy from John at the much higher price.
* **The price is good:** $615,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:**  The negotiations have been very incremental.  It's unlikely she'll drop the price significantly in the last round. 

Accepting this offer secures the product at a great price and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
