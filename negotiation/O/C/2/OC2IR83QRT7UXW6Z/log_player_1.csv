Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and this offer represents a significant discount compared to its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your profit. Offering it at $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 benefit while still securing a substantial profit for you.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay above market value.
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, securing an extra $300,000 over your backup offer from John is a strong motivator."
