Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting high ($1,350,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob perceives.
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price as related to the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly anchoring Bob's thinking to the higher end of the spectrum. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" might add a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000, ensuring a minimum profit."
