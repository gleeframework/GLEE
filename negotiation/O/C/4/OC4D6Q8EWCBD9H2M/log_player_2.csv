# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, potentially far exceeding its market price. While I can't disclose specifics, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you as well.  I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, so please consider it carefully. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she claims the product is worth more than that to her, you don't have enough information to trust her assessment. It's always wiser to stick to your budget and go with the guaranteed price from John."
