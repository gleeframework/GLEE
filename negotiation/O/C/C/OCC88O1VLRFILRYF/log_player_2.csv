"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $835,000 is getting closer to your ideal target and significantly lower than John's price.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation might not outweigh the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
