"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but that price undervalues the product significantly.  It's worth considerably more than that to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very fair offer. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
