"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,000,000 for the product. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with buying from John."
