Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, giving Bob room to negotiate. However, it's still lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, leaving potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is a good offer, it's still below my target. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800} 
```

I'm increasing my previous offer by $300, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my desired profit margin. This counteroffer should encourage Bob to continue negotiating towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still $2,200 more than selling to John.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
