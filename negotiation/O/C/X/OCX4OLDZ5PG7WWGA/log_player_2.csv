"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to bargain. It also reflects the product's value to him.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price is still higher than what the product is worth to Alice, leaving room for her to counter while still potentially making a profit.
* **Building Momentum:**  Starting with a strong counteroffer can create momentum towards a favorable price for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but I can't go lower than $120. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll see that value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Price:**  $120 is still within Bob's budget, and significantly lower than John's price. 
* **Potential for Future Value:** Alice's statement about the product's true worth suggests it might have hidden value that Bob hasn't fully considered. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 7 rounds left, it's getting close to the point where Bob might need to accept a price he's not thrilled with to avoid buying from John.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting the offer at $120 represents a good compromise for Bob. It's within his budget and could potentially be a good investment based on Alice's claims about the product's value."
