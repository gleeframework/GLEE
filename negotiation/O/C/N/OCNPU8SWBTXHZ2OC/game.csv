"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product. I believe it's a fair price given the value I see in it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850000. I truly believe that's a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
