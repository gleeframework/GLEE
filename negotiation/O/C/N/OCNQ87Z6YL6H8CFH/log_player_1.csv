Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm interested in purchasing the product for a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly signaling this is his upper limit with the ""final offer"" language. Accepting $950,000 is a significant profit, and better than risking a lower outcome or going with John at $800,000."
