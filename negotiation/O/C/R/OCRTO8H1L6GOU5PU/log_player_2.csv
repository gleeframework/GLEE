Alice is clearly not going to budge much further. It's unlikely you'll get her below $107, and at this point, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of her ending the negotiation. John's offer of $150 is your safety net, and it's better to take that than risk getting stuck with no deal and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
