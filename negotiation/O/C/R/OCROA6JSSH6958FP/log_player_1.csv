"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate from this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell for that amount just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to earn a substantial profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not ready to sell for that amount yet. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round.  I'm also considering selling to John at this point, as his offer is only slightly lower than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,600,000. This is a slight compromise from my last offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to find a balance between securing a deal and maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm worried that we'll run out of rounds before I can reach a more profitable agreement. John's offer is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a much lower price in the remaining rounds."
