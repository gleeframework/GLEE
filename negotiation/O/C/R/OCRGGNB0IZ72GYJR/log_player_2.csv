{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where there's potential for a deal.  This initial counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a price we can both agree on."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's new offer of $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I'll continue to negotiate for a lower price. There's still room for compromise, and I'm hoping to get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to move closer to her price.  However, it's still below her latest offer, indicating that I'm still trying to negotiate a price that works for both of us."

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is now within my acceptable range, and I'm willing to pay that price.  It's a good compromise, and I'm likely to get a better deal than if I bought from John for $10,000."
