"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000.  This would give you a good return on your investment, and allow me to acquire a valuable asset within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and it's still a good return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
