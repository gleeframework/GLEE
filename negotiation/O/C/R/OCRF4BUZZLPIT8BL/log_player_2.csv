"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.  $1,200,000 is too high for Bob, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000.  This would give you a good return on your investment, and allow me to acquire a valuable asset within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and it's still a good return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further or consider buying from John if the price doesn't come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's initial budget, and it's not clear if further negotiation will get Alice down to his desired price.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for the agreed-upon price of $800,000."
