Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This initial offer is a strong starting point. It's above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly below the product's value to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm not ready to sell for less than $800,000 yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $775,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to go up to $795,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not quite there. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counteroffer one last time before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to an agreement! I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
