# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase the product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that works for both of us. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
