"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $1,300,000. It's a significant investment, but one that I believe will offer substantial value to your operations. I'm confident this is a fair price, given the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and still allows for a healthy profit margin for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
