"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product to my operations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and still allows for a healthy profit margin for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product to my operations.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
