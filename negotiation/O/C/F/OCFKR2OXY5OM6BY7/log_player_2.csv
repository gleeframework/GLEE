"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs and enhance your daily life. For this exceptional item, I propose a starting price of $150. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your $100 limit.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This shows my strong desire to get the product at a good deal, and it also sets the stage for further negotiation.
* **Specific Reason:** I've given Alice a reason for my counteroffer (""a bit steep for me"") to make it feel less arbitrary and open the door for discussion. 
* **Staying Within Budget:** $80 is well within my $100 limit, leaving room for potential concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your offer while still valuing my product, I would like to counter with a price of $100.
