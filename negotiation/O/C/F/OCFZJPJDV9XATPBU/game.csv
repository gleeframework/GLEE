"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and a fair price for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and is closer to my minimum value. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
