"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,875 is close, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  It's a round figure and reflects the true value of this product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
