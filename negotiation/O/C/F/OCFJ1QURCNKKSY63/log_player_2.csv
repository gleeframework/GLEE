"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive, but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening price but still above her minimum value ($8,000). 
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  The message emphasizes Bob's desire to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Sets a clear target:**  By stating a specific price, Bob provides a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. The goal is to keep trying to push Alice down towards that $9,500 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $9,875? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within budget:** This counteroffer keeps Bob well under his $12,000 limit.
* **Showing flexibility:**  Offering to split the difference demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positioning for a potential deal:**  This offer is only slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, making it more likely Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,875 is close, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  It's a round figure and reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $10,000 is only $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and still well within his budget.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting the offer, Bob could still try to negotiate down further in future rounds.
* **Time is a factor:**  Five rounds have already passed, and continuing to negotiate may not be worth the risk of losing the deal to another seller."
