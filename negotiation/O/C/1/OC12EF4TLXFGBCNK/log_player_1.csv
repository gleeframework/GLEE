{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm also framing it in a positive way to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm trying to find a compromise with Bob, offering a price that's still higher than his offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also emphasizing that I'm trying to be flexible, which might encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to risk selling the product for less than it's worth to me.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll take his offer."
