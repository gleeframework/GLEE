"I'm excited to introduce you to this exceptional product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is the maximum I can offer at this time.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a good deal for this product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1600000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1400000. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a better price for this product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value and what we've discussed so far.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1500000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm really trying to stay within my $1400000 limit.  If you're willing to come down to that figure, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider my other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make a concession. However, I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1450000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering what we've discussed so far.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1450000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. My final offer is $1400000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that $1400000 is a price you're comfortable with, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it yet. Considering we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1420000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.",1420000.0,Alice,9,
