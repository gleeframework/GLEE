"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the price I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value of the product while still giving you a great deal. I'm confident this price will work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for a much higher price. If you're serious about making a deal, this is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
