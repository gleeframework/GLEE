"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you know the product is worth less to Alice, her offer is still within your acceptable range and represents a significant saving."
