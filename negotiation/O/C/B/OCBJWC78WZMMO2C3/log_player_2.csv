# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, and I believe it would greatly benefit someone like yourself. Given its worth to you, I propose a transaction price of $10,000. This offer strikes a balance between compensating me fairly for my investment and ensuring you receive a valuable asset at a reasonable price. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John. Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to buy from John and save $2,000."
