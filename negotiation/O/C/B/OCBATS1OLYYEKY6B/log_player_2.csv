"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is better than $1,500,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings, and he knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if a better deal can be reached. There are still several rounds left, so Bob can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his budget as possible, and he believes there's still room to bargain.  $1,100,000 is a modest increase from his previous offer but still lower than Alice's last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while keeping his desired price point in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much from her original offer. It's clear that she is not willing to come down to a price that's comfortable for Bob.  While there are still rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to a price that's significantly lower than $1,300,000. Buying from John at $1,000,000 is a safer option as it guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price point and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
