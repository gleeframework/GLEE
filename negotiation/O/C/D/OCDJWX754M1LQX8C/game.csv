"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product has a lot of value that I believe you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product could be a great fit for me, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",14000.0,Bob,4,
