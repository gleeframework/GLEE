{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's lower than the minimum I'd accept ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay more, especially if he sees it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $125 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $135, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $128 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
