"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than his maximum budget, there's potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. This shows he's serious about negotiating and is willing to compromise. However, he's still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a significant improvement from her initial $10,000 offer. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers.  It's also important to note that Bob only has 10 rounds to close the deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget and avoids the risk of running out of time."
