"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $8,000 and leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price will be attractive to Bob as he values the product at $12,000, while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500 to Bob. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
