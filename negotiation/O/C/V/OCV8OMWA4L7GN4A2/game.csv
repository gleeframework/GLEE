"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
