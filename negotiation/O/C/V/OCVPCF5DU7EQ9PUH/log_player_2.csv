"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and John is selling the product for that price, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. There's no need to negotiate with Alice, as you're already getting the product at your desired price."
