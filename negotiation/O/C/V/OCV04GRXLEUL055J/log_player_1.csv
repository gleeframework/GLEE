Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also high enough that Bob might be willing to consider it, since it's still lower than what the product is worth to him ($8,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum value.  $10,000 is a compromise that could potentially be agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$9,500 is closer to my minimum value and a decent compromise considering that I'm likely not going to get any more out of Bob.  While I'd prefer $12,000, it's not worth risking losing the sale to John."
