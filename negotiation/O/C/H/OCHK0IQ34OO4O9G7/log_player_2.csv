Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my original ask.  Would you be willing to do $15,500?

It's not worth haggling further with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $15,500, and you can get the product for $15,000 from John."
