Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $11,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,750?"", ""product_price"": 12750}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his current offer. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
