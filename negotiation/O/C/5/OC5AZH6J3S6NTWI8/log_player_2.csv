"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for both of us to get a fair deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still offers a substantial value to you. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about $950,000?  This reflects the significant value this product offers you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, $950,000 is a reasonable price. It's significantly less than John's offer and provides a good balance between our target price and Alice's likely minimum. Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or Alice walking away from the deal altogether."
