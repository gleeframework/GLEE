Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for both of us to get a fair deal. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still offers a substantial value to you. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still trying to maximize my profit. I have several rounds remaining and can afford to continue negotiating.  I'll counter with a price closer to $900,000, but still above Bob's offer."
