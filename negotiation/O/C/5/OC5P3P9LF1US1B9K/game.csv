"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm happy to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting your budget and the potential value you'll gain.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's settle on $1,250,000.  It's a good price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
