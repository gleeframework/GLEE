Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $200,000 below his value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's true value to me to make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, as Bob might counteroffer. I'm prepared to go down a bit, but not too much. 
* **Plan B:** I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't agree to a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer is pretty close to what I could get from John.  I don't want to settle for much less than my target price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can push for a higher price.
* **Managing Risk:**  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm willing to take a slight risk of not getting a deal with Bob, as I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal, but I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and respectful, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Final Push:** I'm presenting this as a ""final"" offer, suggesting there might not be much more wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $960,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is only $15,000 away from my previous counteroffer, and it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a lower price or having Bob walk away altogether is high.  
* **Secure Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price ($1,200,000). It's a sure thing, and I'm not willing to risk missing out on that guaranteed profit.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and energy, potentially costing me valuable time and opportunity."
