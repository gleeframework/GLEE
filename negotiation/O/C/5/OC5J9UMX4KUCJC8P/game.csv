"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not sure I can go as high as $1750000. How about $1600000? That's my best and final offer.,1600000.0,Bob,4,
