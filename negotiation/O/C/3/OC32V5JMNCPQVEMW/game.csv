"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but given my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for me, and I hope you'll find it reasonable.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $937,500. This would give you a good deal, and it's the closest I can come without going below my minimum.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $930,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $935,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,7,
