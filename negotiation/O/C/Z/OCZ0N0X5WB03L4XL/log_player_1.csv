Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. You are offering Bob a price that is slightly below your minimum acceptable price but still higher than the product's value to him. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting your offer while still giving you a good return. 

If Bob rejects, you can always sell to John for your minimum price of $15,000."
