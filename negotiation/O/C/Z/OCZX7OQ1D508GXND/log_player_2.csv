"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and John is selling the product for that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product immediately from John and save yourself the time and potential hassle of negotiation."
