Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $670,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is only $20,000 above my target price.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for such a small difference might make Alice less willing to deal. It's better to accept the offer now and secure a good price."
