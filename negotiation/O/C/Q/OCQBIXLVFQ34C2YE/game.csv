"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer but still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
