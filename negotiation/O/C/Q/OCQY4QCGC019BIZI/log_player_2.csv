{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. It's worth exploring the negotiation further to see if you can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range.  This aims to:

* **Establish a lower starting point:** This sets the tone for the negotiation and signals my desire to get a good deal.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  A substantial gap between our offers allows for multiple rounds of negotiation and potential for a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. There's still room for negotiation and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range.  This also leaves room for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I believe we can still negotiate a better deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  It seems like we're both willing to compromise, so I'm hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 685000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller margin.  This demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  At this price, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer, and it's likely Alice is close to accepting.  I'm aiming to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within a comfortable range for me. While I could continue to negotiate and try to get a slightly lower price, the risk of reaching a stalemate or Alice walking away is increasing. It's more advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's significantly better than John's offer."
