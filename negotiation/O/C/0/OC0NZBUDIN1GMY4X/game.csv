"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a deal, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, so I'm offering it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
