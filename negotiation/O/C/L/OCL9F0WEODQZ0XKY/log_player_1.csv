Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum, but also leaves some room for bargaining.  It acknowledges the value Bob sees in the product while still allowing you to potentially earn a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135 as a compromise.  It's closer to Bob's offer, but still allows me to earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
