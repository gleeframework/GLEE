It's always worth exploring a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

Let's start with a significant counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal.  $4,000 is a big jump down, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."

Alice has come down to $4,500, which is a good deal considering I can get it from John for $8,000.  Let's take this offer and save some money."
