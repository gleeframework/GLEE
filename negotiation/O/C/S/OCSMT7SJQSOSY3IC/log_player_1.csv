"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  It's a significant markup from my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate from there. I'm also leaving room for myself to potentially lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, which is $1,000,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to his initial offer than my previous one.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to compromise and we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering less than my minimum. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of limited rounds,  I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to negotiate, Bob will also come up in his offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not willing to sell for less than my minimum, even though we're approaching the midpoint of the negotiation. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm going to stick to my guns and try to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering $1,025,000,  which is closer to Bob's last offer. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, and I'm hoping he'll reciprocate.  I'm getting nervous with the limited rounds remaining, but I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the risk of not getting my minimum price from Bob is too high.  I've already gone down significantly in my offers, and I'm worried that if I reject his offer again, he might not come up any further. I'm also worried about running out of time and not being able to close the deal.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob."
