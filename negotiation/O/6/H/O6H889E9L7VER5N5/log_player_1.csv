Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $875,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aware of the value of the product and is trying to negotiate a lower price. While $775,000 is closer to our minimum, we are still early in the negotiation. We can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $775,000 is really cutting it too close. Let's settle at $825,000 and close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making another concession but a smaller one to show we're moving towards a deal but still hold value.
* **Strong Stance:**  The language ""cutting it too close"" and ""settle at"" indicates firmness while remaining open to a deal. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're halfway through the rounds and want to incentivize Bob to agree before we explore other options more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000 to try and finalize this today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we *might* be able to get slightly more from Bob in further rounds, there's also a chance he walks away. Accepting guarantees us a good return.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows us to move on."
