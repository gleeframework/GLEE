"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than the product's worth to her ($1,500,000), you know you can get it for significantly less from John ($1,000,000). By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply purchase from John and maximize your savings."
