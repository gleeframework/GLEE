"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be even more valuable to you. My initial offer is $1400000. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and settle on $1300000? This allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. Can we meet in the middle at $1225000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a fair price that takes both our needs into consideration. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1250000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not going any higher. Can we do $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
