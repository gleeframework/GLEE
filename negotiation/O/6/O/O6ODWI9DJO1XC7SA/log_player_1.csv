"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

This offer is too low.  I'll try to negotiate towards a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your budget, $70 is significantly below its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting $85 is a reasonable compromise."
