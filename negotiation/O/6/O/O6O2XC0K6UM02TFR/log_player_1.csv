Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $1,400,000 is greater than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so you still make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  $1,400,000 is lower than the value Bob places on the product ($1,500,000). This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, as he still gains value from the purchase. 

By offering a price in the middle ground, you increase your chances of securing a higher sale while still having a backup option with John."
