"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, the $600,000 price point doesn't reflect the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering its potential return on investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still very far apart.  I can appreciate there's value in this product but $1,300,000 is not feasible for me.  I could go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
