"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is within your budget, it's quite close to your maximum. You know Alice values the product at a lower price, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance:

* **Ambitious but reasonable:** Starting at $12,500 is a significant jump from Alice's offer but is still within a plausible negotiation range, given your $15,000 maximum. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer allows you to gauge how much lower Alice is willing to go. Her response will give you valuable information for your next move.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** Even if Alice rejects this specific price, there's space for further negotiation between $12,500 and her initial $14,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $13,500? That still leaves room for you to get a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. Her willingness to drop to $13,500 suggests she might go even lower. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on and gives you a chance to secure a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer proposes a price directly in between your last offer ($12,500) and Alice's current offer ($13,500).  It's a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to be fair and find agreement.
* **Maintaining momentum:** By suggesting a specific price, you keep the negotiation moving and encourage Alice to respond concretely rather than just rejecting your offer outright. 
* **Staying within budget:** This offer still keeps you well below your $15,000 maximum, ensuring you achieve your goal of saving money even if Alice accepts it."
