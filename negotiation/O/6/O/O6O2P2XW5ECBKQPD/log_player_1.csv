# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and allows for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
