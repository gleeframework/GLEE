"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price to get closer to my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a more limited budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's asking price ($18,000). This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Show Interest:** I'm expressing my interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Setting a Target:** My ideal price is closer to $10,000. By starting low, I'm hoping to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not there yet:**  Alice moving to $12,000 shows she's willing to negotiate, but it's still above my $10,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're early in the negotiation, and I believe there's still room to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. To be honest, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? That would work much better for my budget."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $8,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying below John:** I need to keep my offers below $10,000 (John's price) to make the negotiation worthwhile.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  I'm aiming for a price that's beneficial for both of us, hoping Alice will see my offer as reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has come down to $10,000, which matches John's offer. 
* **No Point in Continuing:**  There's no benefit to negotiating further since I can get the product at this price elsewhere.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice increasing the price again or the negotiation breaking down."
