"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I won't get more than John is offering. It makes more sense to sell to John for a guaranteed $150 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
