"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd really find it useful. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible if you need to lower the price. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial high price helps gauge Bob's interest. If he immediately rejects it, we know he's aiming for a much lower price point. If he counters, it gives us information about his potential price range. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell below our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can only pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $150 meets our minimum, we started high for a reason.  There's a chance we can negotiate a slightly better price. We'll counter-offer and see how he responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $180 for it. It's a great product and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value from it."", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're coming down from our initial price, signaling flexibility, but not by too much.  $180 is a compromise between our initial ask and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still above Bob's valuation and our minimum, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been thinking about it and I'm still interested in purchasing the product. I would like to propose a price of $160. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $160 is a good price, exceeding our minimum by $10.
* **Time Value:** We're already on round 4, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk prolonging the negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John offers $150, accepting Bob's offer gives us an extra $10 for relatively little additional effort."
