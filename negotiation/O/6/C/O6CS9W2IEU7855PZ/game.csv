"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,125?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me.  I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $9,900?  That's a firm offer, as I'm getting close to my limit.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,900 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $10,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
