"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance you could get a better price.  You're willing to pay $150 to John, so rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting the product for less from her in a counter-offer."
