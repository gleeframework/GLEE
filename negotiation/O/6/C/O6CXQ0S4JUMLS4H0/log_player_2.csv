**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's not worth it for Bob to accept the offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject and try to negotiate further. There's still room for Alice to lower the price and Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
