"Bob, I have a unique product I believe will be of great interest to you. It's valued at over $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned is over $1000000 to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. It's worth considerably more than that to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $1100000 is a fair offer, but it's still a little below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time,  I'm offering the product for $1150000.  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll be selling to John. Let me know your decision.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
