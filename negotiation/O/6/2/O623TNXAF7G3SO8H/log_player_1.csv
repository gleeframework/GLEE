Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a good starting point because it's a little above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $150, as that's my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. I can do better than $155. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell for less than $160."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $160. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to drop below my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $157.5 is close to my minimum, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from him. I'm going to accept and sell the product to Bob."
