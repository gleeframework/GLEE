"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from owning this product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $950000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is still a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for your product, but I'm afraid $1075000 is still above my budget.

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $1075000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1060000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $1060000 is still not within my budget.

I believe this is the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. I'd appreciate it if you could consider it.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
