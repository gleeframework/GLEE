{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is slightly above the product's worth to Bob, but still below the price John is willing to pay. This gives Bob room to negotiate without you having to immediately go down to his price.  It also keeps your potential profit margin open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm hoping I can get him closer to my desired price of $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,150,000 is too low for me.  How about $1,200,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's my absolute minimum."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and getting him any closer seems unlikely.  I've already lost a lot of time negotiating with him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
