"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer.  Those extras do sound nice! To be honest though,  $10,000 is the highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your top limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",9800.0,Alice,5,
