Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,300,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's maximum valuation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties (John) creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching an even higher final price."
