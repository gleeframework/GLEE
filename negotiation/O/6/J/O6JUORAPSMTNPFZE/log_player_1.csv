Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is willing to pay more.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming high initially. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
