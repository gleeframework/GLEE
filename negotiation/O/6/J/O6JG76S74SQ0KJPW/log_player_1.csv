Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm not getting any higher offers from Bob, I'll decide to sell the product to Bob for $10,000. I'll choose option (1):

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
