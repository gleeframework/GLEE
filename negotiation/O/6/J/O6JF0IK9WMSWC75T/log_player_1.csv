Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. It's a unique item with significant value, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always beneficial to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) will help gauge his interest level. If he's willing to negotiate around this higher price, it indicates a strong desire for the product.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to be more assertive in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insight into Bob's personality (e.g., is he known to be a tough negotiator?), you might adjust your strategy accordingly.
* **Market Information:** If possible, try to gather information about similar products' market prices. This can strengthen your negotiating position."
