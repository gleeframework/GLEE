,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $117.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",117.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  While $117 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $120? This is my final offer, and it would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
