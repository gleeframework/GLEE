"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's important to start low to give room for negotiation but not insultingly low (considering Alice values the product at $120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down a bit, how about $125? It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a price I'd be willing to pay, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

This counter-offer aims to settle at a price favorable to both. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay while also matching Alice's valuation of the product."
