Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to maneuver and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's seriousness and provide insight into his perceived value of the product. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong fallback position. You can afford to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I need to make sure it fits within it. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is already above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting $1,400,000 would be less than John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** By rejecting and countering, we can try to meet somewhere between $1,400,000 and our desired price, aiming for a win-win scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your offer."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding firm above John's price. 
* **Justifying the Value:**  By reiterating the product's value, we're reminding Bob why a higher price is warranted.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The ""meeting in the middle"" approach can encourage a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now more profitable than selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **Limited Upside Potential:**  While we could try to push for more, Bob's message suggests he might not go much higher. Risking further negotiation might lead to him walking away.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting a good offer now avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation and guarantees a significant profit."
