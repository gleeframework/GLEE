Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and that Bob is unaware of your agreement with John."
