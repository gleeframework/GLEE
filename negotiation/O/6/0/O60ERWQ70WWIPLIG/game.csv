"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $105. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay a premium, and I appreciate that. However, $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll counter with $110. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $105. I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $105 yet. I'll make one more counteroffer to $115. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $112.50. I'm getting close to my budget, but I really want this product.",112.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to get close to your budget! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $112.50 yet. I'll make one final counteroffer to $118. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",118.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to walk away if I can't get a better deal. I'll make one last counteroffer of $110. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",110.0,Bob,10,
