"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a more competitive price point. Would you consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price point you've suggested. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  However, to make this deal work for me, I need to be closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $620,000?",620000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer. How about we settle at $700,000? This represents a significant investment for me but recognizes the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this negotiation has gone back and forth quite a bit, and we're getting close to the wire.  To prevent this from going any further, I'd be willing to meet you at $740,000. This is my final offer; otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",740000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your urgency, but I'm not willing to accept $740,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",795000.0,Alice,9,
