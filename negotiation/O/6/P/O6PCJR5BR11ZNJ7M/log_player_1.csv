Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($120), giving me leverage while still leaving a chance for him to accept.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for earning a higher profit."
