You can do better than $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within your budget. It's not as good as your original counteroffer, but it's a reasonable price considering your alternative is $100. It's better to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
