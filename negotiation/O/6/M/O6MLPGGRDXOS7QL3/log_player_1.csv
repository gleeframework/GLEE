Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to charge the highest price Bob is likely to accept, which is likely a bit below his maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a high probability of him accepting the offer."
