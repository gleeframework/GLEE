Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter, but there's a good chance he'll accept to avoid losing the deal.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still has John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000."
