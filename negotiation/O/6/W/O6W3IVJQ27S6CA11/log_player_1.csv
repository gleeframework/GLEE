Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it's lower than your minimum acceptable price of $100.  If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John and earn $100.  This strategy gives Bob a chance to get a deal, while ensuring you don't lose money."
