"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be a reasonable starting point.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for this product. Could you do $18,000? ",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my previous offer.  While $18,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need, but I am willing to come down to $15,500.  This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $15,500 is your final offer, however, that price remains outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end. Let me know if this works for you.",13250.0,Bob,6,
