"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $14000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not getting anywhere, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $14500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can do $14000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure if I can keep negotiating beyond this point.",14000.0,Alice,7,
