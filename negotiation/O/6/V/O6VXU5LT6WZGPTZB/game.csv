"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a one-time opportunity. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discount.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for it. Let's meet at $850,000 and see if we can finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $825,000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower. If we can agree on $825,000, I'm confident we can finalize the deal and you'll be happy with the product. Let's make it happen.",825000.0,Alice,7,
