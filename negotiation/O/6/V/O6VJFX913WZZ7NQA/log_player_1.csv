{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its true market value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the deal for Bob, emphasizing that the price is below market value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** While not my ideal price, $1,200,000 is still significantly more than what I'd get from John.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By keeping the offer below my minimum, I retain the option to walk away and sell to John if necessary. 
* **Encourage negotiation:**  Bob is more likely to counteroffer if he sees potential for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price and doesn't reflect the true value of the product. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Future Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to reach a compromise that's beneficial for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, explaining that I'm willing to negotiate but cannot go significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still being a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still offering the product for a price significantly above Bob's offer, ensuring I don't undervalue it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, suggesting a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that this is a good deal.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum, I'm:

* Increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
*  Demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my leverage.
*  Setting the stage for a possible final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially given that Bob is clearly interested in the product. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming for a compromise that's closer to my minimum. I'll also reiterate the value of the product and my willingness to find a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  $950,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,000,000? This price allows me to stay within my desired range while still providing you with a great opportunity.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, showing that I'm actively negotiating.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price remains above Bob's offer but closer to his range, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my value.
* **Closing the Gap:**  The price difference is now smaller, increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm ending with a positive and motivating statement, encouraging Bob to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** By offering $1,000,000, I'm hoping to find a price that both Bob and I can agree on.
* **Encourage acceptance:** This offer is more attractive to Bob than my previous ones, making him more likely to accept.
* **Secure a good deal:**  While not my ideal price, $1,000,000 is still a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still not enough.
* **Risk of Lower Offers:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his counteroffers, potentially pushing me below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and ensures a significant profit.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer is too high. Selling to John is the most reliable option to secure my minimum price and close the deal."
