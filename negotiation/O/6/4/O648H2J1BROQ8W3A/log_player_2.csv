"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is a good sign she's willing to negotiate, but there's room to try and get a lower price. It's worth seeing how low Alice is willing to go before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's counter again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,600? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 6600
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,600 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one. Alice is holding firm, and $7,000 is a decent price.  However, we're getting close to the halfway point in the negotiation, and I think there's still a chance to get it lower.  It's a gamble, but I'm willing to risk one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to make one final offer: $6,800. If you're unable to accept that, I understand, but I'll need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 6800
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer attempts to meet Alice closer to the middle while still aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** By presenting it as a ""final offer,"" it creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that we're not desperate and are prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,800 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give away the value of the product for too much less. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $6,800, so I'll offer it to you for $6,900. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, Alice is unlikely to budge much further from her ""final offer."" The potential savings of $100 or less aren't worth the risk of her walking away from the deal.
* **Good Overall Deal:** $6,900 is a solid discount off the initial offer and a good price for the product, especially considering its value to both buyer and seller.
* **Time Investment:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield significantly better results and could drag the process out further."
