"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $140 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. If that works for you, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",150.0,Bob,4,
