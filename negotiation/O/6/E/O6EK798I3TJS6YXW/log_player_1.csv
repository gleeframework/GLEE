"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good return on my minimum value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price. I have 8 rounds left, and the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm setting my counteroffer at my minimum acceptable price. This ensures I'm not losing money, and it gives Bob a clear indication of my bottom line. It's a fair offer, considering he's willing to pay $850,000."
