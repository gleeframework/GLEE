"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $1000000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1050000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1080000.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair value for the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1020000 is the maximum I can go. Can we meet in the middle once more?",1020000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm counteroffering at $1080000 again, but this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a decent profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1000000, and that's as low as I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to meet me at $1000000, Bob. However, I've already told you that's not my final offer. I'm going to make one last attempt to get a better price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, and this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a better price, Alice, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to go any higher than $1000000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
