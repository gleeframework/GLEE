"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth a significant amount to me, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its true value. With that in mind, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but the price point you're suggesting is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to listen to your proposal. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
