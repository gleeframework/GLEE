Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While it's slightly higher than your initial target, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John.  You're getting a good price while saving $125,000.  There's a risk of continuing negotiations, but the potential for further savings is limited."
