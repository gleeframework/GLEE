"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it gives you a good return on your investment while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
