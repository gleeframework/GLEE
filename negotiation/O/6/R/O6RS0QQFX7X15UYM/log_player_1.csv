Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Above minimum:** $14,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving you a good margin. 
* **Not too high:** The offer isn't so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected out of hand. 
* **Negotiation room:**  There's space for Bob to negotiate a lower price if he feels the product isn't worth $14,000.

By starting at $14,000, you increase the chance of getting a higher price while having a fallback option with John if Bob declines."
