"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet halfway.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,040,000. Let's close this deal. This is my final offer.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both sticking to our numbers. I'm willing to compromise just a bit more and come down to $1,030,000. This is my final offer. Let's get this done.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,030,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,015,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $1,000,000, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1015000.0,Bob,8,
