Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $14,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price lower than what you might initially aim for, you're signaling to Bob that you're open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I would like to make you an offer of $13000 for the product. I hope this is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired $14,000. There's a good chance Bob is willing to pay a little more, especially since he already acknowledged the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise but still stand my ground.  
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce my position.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept."
