Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a significant premium over its value to you. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're very close. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, which is almost halfway between our current positions.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal.

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has signaled this is his final offer. Accepting $990,000 provides a substantial profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
