"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than the asking price. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's a significant gap between your desired price and her bottom line.

**Next Steps:** You'll counteroffer Alice in the next round, aiming to get a lower price."
