"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation.  It also establishes a strong starting point. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,700,000 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm confident I can get a better price, given that I have more rounds of negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,900,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,650,000 yet. I'm going to try and counteroffer one more time before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer and only $50,000 away from Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal. I have a few rounds left, and I'm going to try one more time to get Bob closer to my price.  If he doesn't come up, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

This is my final attempt to get a better price from Bob. I'm dropping my offer to $1,600,000, which is only $50,000 above Bob's last offer.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I'd prefer to get a little more for the product, it's clear that Bob won't budge on his offer.  I only have two rounds left, and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price from Bob.  Selling to John is the best option for me at this point."
