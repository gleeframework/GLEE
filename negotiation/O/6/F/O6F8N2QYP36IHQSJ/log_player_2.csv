"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $1,450,000, especially since you know the product is worth less to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,375,000 which is a good price for you.  While you can continue negotiating, you risk Alice walking away and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer saves you money and secures the product."
