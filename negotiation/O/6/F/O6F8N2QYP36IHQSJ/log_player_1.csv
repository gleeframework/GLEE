{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential negotiation. 
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:** You're not starting with a ridiculously high price, indicating you want to negotiate in good faith.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it leaves room for us both to be happy with the transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you believe the product is worth, and you can likely get a better price.  By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
