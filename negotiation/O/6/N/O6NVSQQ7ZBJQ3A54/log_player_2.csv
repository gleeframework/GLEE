"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, and you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the discount, $800,000 is still a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I want to see if I can get even lower than that, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there yet. $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but we're getting close.  I want to see if I can push for a lower price before considering John's offer. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price represents a good compromise and allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a stalemate. Alice is firm on her price of $975,000, and I'm unwilling to go higher.  While I could continue negotiating, it seems unlikely that she will budge any further. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get the product.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget and guarantees the purchase."
