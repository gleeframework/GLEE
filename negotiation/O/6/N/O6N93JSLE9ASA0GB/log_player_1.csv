"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for the highest possible price initially, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $175 is more than Bob's value, but it's not unreasonable given my own value of $150. This allows for potential counteroffers without feeling like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I can use this to my advantage in the next round.
* **Selling to John is a better option:** If I can't reach a better agreement with Bob, selling to John guarantees me my minimum value. However, I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $160 is exactly halfway between my starting offer of $175 and Bob's offer of $130. This signals a willingness to compromise and encourages further negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A positive and friendly message maintains a good rapport with Bob, making him more likely to continue the conversation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  While $160 is still above Bob's value, it's a significant concession from my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $145 is only $5 below my minimum value of $150. Accepting this offer would minimize my potential loss if I were to sell to John.
* **Positive momentum:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, suggesting a possibility of reaching a deal that is closer to my desired price.
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal with Bob altogether and forcing me to accept John's offer of $150. 

By accepting this offer, I secure a price that's close to my minimum, and there's still potential for further negotiation in future rounds if the opportunity arises."
