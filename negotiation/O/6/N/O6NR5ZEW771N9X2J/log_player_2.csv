"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. My initial offer for the product is $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's below your maximum price, but you can likely do better. 
* **You have time to negotiate.** There are 10 rounds, so you can push for a lower price without rushing.
* **John's offer is your safety net.** If negotiations fall apart, you have a solid backup. 

By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to walk away, which can increase Alice's motivation to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking for a price closer to $900,000 to make this deal work for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input and am willing to consider your needs. In light of this, I propose a counteroffer of $925,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both the value of the product to you and my position. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still not ideal.** She's come down from $950,000 to $925,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **There's still room for improvement.** You're aiming for $900,000, and you have more rounds to try. 
* **You have a fallback option.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000. 

By rejecting, you maintain pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $925,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $912,500. This shows my commitment to the deal, and I hope it's a figure we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 912500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In order to reach an agreement, I propose a counteroffer of $917,500. This figure represents a compromise that acknowledges your budgetary constraints while still reflecting the value of the product. I hope this proposal will facilitate our transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $917,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $917,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your target.**  You were aiming for $900,000, and she's only $17,500 above that.
* **Time is ticking.** You only have five rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll get Alice to drop much further. 
* **John's offer is a safety net, but not ideal.**  While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $82,500.

Given the time constraint and the proximity to your target price, it's strategically sound to accept Alice's offer."
