"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than the value this product brings to you.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit while ensuring a fair return for me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
