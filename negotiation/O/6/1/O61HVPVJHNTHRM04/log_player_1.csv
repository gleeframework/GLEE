"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is more than my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is now very close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk him rejecting any further counteroffers.  I'd rather secure the deal now and avoid the potential of ending up with John's lower offer."
