"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for negotiation while staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is framed positively to gauge Bob's initial interest and encourage counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both our starting price and our minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and there's room to work towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  We are making a substantial jump from Bob's offer to signal that his initial price was far too low. 
* **Justification:** We are providing a brief explanation for the increase, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Compromise:**  The $1,300,000 price shows a willingness to negotiate while staying closer to our desired range. We are still aiming for a price above our safety net ($1,200,000 from John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches our minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and we risk him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a fair price and avoids the potential risk of losing both offers."
