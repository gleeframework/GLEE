Alice's offer:

Bob should accept the offer.  At this point, Alice has come down to Bob's previous counteroffer of $14,000.  It's a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $15,000.  There's a good chance that if Bob rejects the offer again, Alice will either stick to her price or go even higher."
