"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $7,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer considering I could buy it from John for that price right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
