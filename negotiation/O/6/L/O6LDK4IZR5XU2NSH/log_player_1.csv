"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I think I can get a better offer from Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $850,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $800,000. I'm confident that I can either convince Bob to come up a bit more or sell the product to John for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $780,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $820,000 for this product.  This is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 820000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $820,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $790,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While Bob's offer of $790,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer is much more appealing, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity.  The negotiation with Bob has gone on long enough, and I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer."
