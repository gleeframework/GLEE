Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob without him rejecting the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so offering it below this price is leaving money on the table.
* **John's Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 tempts Bob with a small ""discount"" while maximizing potential profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob and ensuring you get a price significantly closer to the product's true value to you."
