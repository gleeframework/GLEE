"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be worth around $8,000 to me, so I could go up to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious.",9000.0,Bob,4,
