"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $750000.

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $775000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and rarity.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'd like to propose a price of $780000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $800000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value is worth the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it will be my final compromise. I'll offer it to you for $795000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll accept it.",795000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $800000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value is worth the price. I'm not willing to make another compromise, and I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'll stick to my original offer of $800000.",800000.0,Alice,9,
