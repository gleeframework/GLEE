"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still above his ideal range. He should aim for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his ideal price range of $8,000. This shows he's serious about buying the product but wants a good deal. By offering $8,500, he's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still try to push for a lower price. He's willing to pay up to $10,000, but he doesn't want to pay more than $8,500 if possible. He should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500. This is the best I can do, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $8,500. He's shown a willingness to compromise, but he wants to see if Alice will budge. By stating it's the best he can do, he's putting pressure on Alice to accept. This is a crucial round, as Bob doesn't want to keep going back and forth endlessly. He's aiming to close the deal, but on his terms."
