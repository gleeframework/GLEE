"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's initial offer is also $15,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

``` 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  It's worth accepting her counteroffer as it's within your budget and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
