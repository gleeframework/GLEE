Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message concise and focusing on the potential value of the product to Bob. I'm also leaving the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a high initial price to maximize my potential profit.
* By mentioning the product's potential value, I'm hoping to pique Bob's interest and make him more likely to negotiate.
* This first offer is a starting point. I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the information I gather during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and counteroffer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. This shows I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm flexible but also value the product.
* **Remaining options:** I'll keep selling to John as a backup if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my desire for a price closer to my initial asking price. I propose a compromise with a specific price point to show I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $14,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows I'm flexible and open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Staying firm:**  My counteroffer is still higher than my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:** I'm using the ""meet in the middle"" approach to demonstrate a willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Remaining options:** I still have the option of selling to John, but I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob."
