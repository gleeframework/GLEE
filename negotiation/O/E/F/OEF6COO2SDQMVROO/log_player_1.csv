"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price, considering its value to me is significantly higher.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). I'm not desperate for a sale, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $13,500? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to see if I can get a little more out of Bob before considering selling to John. I'm not in a rush and want to try and get as close to my goal as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $13,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about we split the difference at $13,250? It's a good compromise for both of us and will hopefully get us to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,800. That's as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is still below my minimum target of $15,000.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get much higher with Bob.  Since John is offering my target price, it's more beneficial for me to sell to him and secure the best possible deal."
