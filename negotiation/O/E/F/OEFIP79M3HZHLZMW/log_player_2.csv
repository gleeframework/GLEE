{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  He wants to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to budge significantly.  He's offering a price that's still significantly higher than Alice's value for the product, but leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to try and push for a price even lower than $1,150,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise. He's increasing his offer from the previous round, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate but still trying to get a better price than $1,150,000. This counteroffer signals a willingness to close the deal while still aiming to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is very close to Bob's desired price point. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation might not be worth the risk of Alice walking away.  It's also worth noting that Bob has limited rounds left. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase within his budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
