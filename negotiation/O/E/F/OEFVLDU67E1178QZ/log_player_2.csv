"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you, so paying $1,200,000 is too high.  You can try to negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want to save as much as possible."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'm going to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John, as his price is the best I can get at this point."
