"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice is cheaper:** Alice's offer of $90 is lower than John's price of $100.
* **You are willing to pay more:** The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is within your budget. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
