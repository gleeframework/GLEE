Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also shows you are serious about selling to him, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a price closer to my initial offer. It allows for further negotiation without losing too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's higher than John's offer.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
