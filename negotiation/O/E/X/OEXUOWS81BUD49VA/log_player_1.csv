Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $1200000, which is a fair price based on my valuation. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
