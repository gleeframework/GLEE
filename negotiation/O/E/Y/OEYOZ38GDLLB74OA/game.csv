"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully nurtured and developed, and I know it aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its true potential.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
