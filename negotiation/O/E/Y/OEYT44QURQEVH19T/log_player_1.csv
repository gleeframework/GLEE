Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows for potential negotiation downwards while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the price more palatable.
* **Backup Option:** We have a safety net with John ($800,000), so we can afford to aim high with Bob.

By setting the initial price at $925,000, Alice maximizes her potential earnings while still offering Bob a price that's likely attractive to him."
