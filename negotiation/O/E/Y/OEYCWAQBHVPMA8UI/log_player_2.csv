"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price. Alice is offering a good starting price, but there's room for improvement. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $800,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. It's a strong starting point for a counteroffer, and we'll see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a reasonable price considering the product's value to her. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of going another round with Alice and potentially getting a worse offer from her or even having her reject my offer completely isn't worth it. Buying from John would also be more expensive.  Accepting this offer ensures a purchase at a good price without unnecessary risk."
