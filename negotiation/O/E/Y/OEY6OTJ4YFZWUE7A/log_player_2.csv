"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  You're willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer is below that, so it's a good starting point.
* **Negotiation:**  There's room to potentially save money by counter-offering. You might be able to get a better deal than $90. 
* **Risk:** Buying from John immediately removes the potential for a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $75?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's original price. This shows you're serious about getting a deal but also sets a clear lower limit.
* **Value Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer (your budget) and emphasizes your genuine interest in the product. 
* **Positive Framing:** It uses positive language to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Further Savings:** By rejecting this offer, you can continue to try and get the price down.
* **John as a Backup:**  You still have John as a fallback option, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $82.50 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $80.  This is my absolute limit, and I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** The counteroffer is a small but meaningful decrease from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise but not surrender.
* **Firm but Friendly:**  The message reiterates your budget constraint and expresses hope for a resolution, keeping a positive tone.
* **Finality Implication:**  Stating ""absolute limit"" subtly suggests that rejecting this offer could lead to you choosing John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $81.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer is only $1.50 above your desired price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiations. Continuing to bargain risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Alice's Flexibility:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, indicating she might be getting closer to her minimum price.

While it's tempting to try and get the price down further, accepting at this point is a smart move. You've secured a decent deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product."
