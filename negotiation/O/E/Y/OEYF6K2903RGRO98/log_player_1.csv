Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's room for him to counter and for you to potentially reach a price closer to his value.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  Starting with a slightly higher price shows you're open to discussion and encourages Bob to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to push for a slightly higher price. You can likely secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $85 is tempting, I'd really like to get closer to $90 to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly settle on $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $86 is only $1 less than your last counteroffer, and it's a decent amount above your minimum acceptable price of $80.  Since there's not much room for further negotiation, accepting his offer is the best strategy to secure a sale and earn a profit."
