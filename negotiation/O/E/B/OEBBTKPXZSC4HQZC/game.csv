"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $14500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $14000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you the product for $15800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",15800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $14500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14500. I can offer you the product for $15200. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value. What do you think?",15200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer of $12000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for the same price. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,10,
