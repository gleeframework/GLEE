"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
