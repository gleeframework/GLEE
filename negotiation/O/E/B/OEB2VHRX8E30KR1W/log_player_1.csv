Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not willing to drop my price too much further. This offer is a compromise - it's closer to Bob's valuation, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. At this point, I'm better off selling to John and ensuring I get my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that we could end up with a price lower than what John is offering."
