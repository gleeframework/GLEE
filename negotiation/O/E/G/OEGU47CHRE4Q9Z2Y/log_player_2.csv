Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  How about $800,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $800000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $820000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

Alice has made a final concession, and while $815,000 is still more than what I initially wanted, it's a good deal considering the value of the product and the possibility of buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's time to close the deal."
