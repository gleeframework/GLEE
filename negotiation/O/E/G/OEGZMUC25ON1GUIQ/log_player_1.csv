Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $15,000.
* **Value Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it hints at the product's worth and your willingness to offer an exclusive deal. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
