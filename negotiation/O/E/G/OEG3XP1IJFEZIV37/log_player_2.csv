"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $100.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you more leverage to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum selling price.  Let's see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is better than $100, it's still higher than my target price of $90. I'll reject the offer and counter again, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $92.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price that's fair for both of us."
