Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  I've given this number a lot of thought, and to be candid, $1,800,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed that investment for you.
