"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  I've given this number a lot of thought, and to be candid, $1,800,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed that investment for you.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
