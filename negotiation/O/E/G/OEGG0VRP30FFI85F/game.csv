"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's potential significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a firm offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need you to meet me closer to that figure.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,750,000. This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm going to make one final offer: $1,250,000.  If you accept, we have a deal.  If not, I'll be forced to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
