"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price given the value to me and leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This reflects the value to you while still giving me a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000.  I think this is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
