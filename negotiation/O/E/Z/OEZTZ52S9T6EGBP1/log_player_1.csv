Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you.  I'm asking $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. While selling to John for $15,000 is a possibility, I still believe there's room for negotiation with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially reaching a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still confident you'll find it a fair deal considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's value and reinforce the ""fair deal"" perception.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, suggesting that I might be open to a slightly lower price if necessary. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a middle ground while ensuring I receive a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price. 

Given that I can sell to John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of losing a deal."
