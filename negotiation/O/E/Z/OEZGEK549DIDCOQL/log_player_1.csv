Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer immediately. I can still try to get a better price from him.  While John is offering $100, I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'll try to counteroffer him and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $115? It's still a good deal for you since you value it at $150."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my desired price, and I've already rejected a similar offer in the previous round. I'm happy with this price and don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by trying for more."
