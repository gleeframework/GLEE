Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has a clear incentive to counteroffer, as he can get the product for less than its value to him. 
* **Offers a fair price:**  It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, making it tempting for him to accept.
* **Is above your minimum:** You're still getting a profit above your minimum value, ensuring you won't lose money if Bob accepts the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly below your initial offer of $10,000 and likely leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired $10,000. This increases your chances of getting a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. This counteroffer should be higher than $8,500 but lower than $10,000.  For example, you could offer $9,250,  keeping in mind Bob's perceived value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balance:** This counteroffer strikes a balance between your desire to maximize profit and the need to keep the negotiation moving forward.  
* **Fairness:** $9,250 is a fair price for Bob, given that it's still below the $12,000 he values the product at.
* **Negotiation Space:**  It leaves room for further negotiation if Bob decides to counter again.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts your counteroffer, you've successfully negotiated a better price than your initial offer.
* If Bob rejects your counteroffer, you'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gain is small. There's a risk that Bob will walk away or counter with an even lower offer.  
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and you might not get a better price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and risk-averse strategy at this point.  You'll secure a decent profit while avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
