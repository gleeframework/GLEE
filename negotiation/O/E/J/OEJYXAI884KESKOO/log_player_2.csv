"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe this price reflects its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob has room to negotiate further. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still higher than Alice's value of $12,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also has a limit on how much he's willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. However, I'm looking for a price closer to $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,750 is still within Bob's budget and is a better price than John's offer of $15,000. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids potential delays and uncertainty."
