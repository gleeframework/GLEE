"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and I truly believe it will be a game-changer for you. Considering the value it brings, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a great deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Instead of just stating the price, the message focuses on the product's value to Bob. This helps justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message uses phrases like ""proposing a starting price"" and ""What do you think?"" to signal that you're open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While his counteroffer was expected after your high starting point, it's too far off the mark to accept. You have room to negotiate and John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering the immense benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Counteroffer:** It's important to show Bob you've considered his offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding him of the product's value helps justify the higher price.
* **Significant but Gradual Reduction:** A $50,000 decrease shows flexibility but keeps the price near your target.
* **Framing as a Compromise:**  Presenting the new price as a ""middle ground"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price and provides a $50,000 profit margin. While you could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or stall the negotiations. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
