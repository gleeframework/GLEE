Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profitable sale.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is direct and explains the reasoning behind the offer.

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price while having a safety net of selling to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to consider his offer, I need to hold firm on my goals. 

I will counteroffer Bob and aim for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up in his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of a prolonged negotiation and potentially getting a lower price isn't worth it.

Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum desired profit and avoids further uncertainty."
