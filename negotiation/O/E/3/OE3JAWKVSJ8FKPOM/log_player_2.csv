"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Since the product is worth more to Alice than Bob, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than her original offer, and it's only $50,000 more than John's price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it's risky. If Alice rejects Bob's next offer, she might raise her price back to her original $1,100,000. It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
