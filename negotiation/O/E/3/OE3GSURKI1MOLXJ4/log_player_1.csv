Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good starting point.  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and how high he's willing to go. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his upper limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us.  If Bob still refuses, I might consider selling to John, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to come up to my minimum acceptable price. While $850,000 is still a profit for me, it's not worth the continued negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
