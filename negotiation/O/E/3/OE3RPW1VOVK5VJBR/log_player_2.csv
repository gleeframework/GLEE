"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a starting price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price. You have a safety net with John who's willing to sell for your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also determined to get a good deal. This also leaves enough room for Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation going without immediately reaching a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite low for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have a backup option with John. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, indicating that you're serious about buying the product.  This allows for a little room for Alice to counter if she wants, while also setting a clear upper limit for you."
