"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $20000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for this exceptional product. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This is my final offer.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to meet you at $15000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal for $18000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for this exceptional product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,5,
