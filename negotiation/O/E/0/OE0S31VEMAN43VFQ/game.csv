"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be workable?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
