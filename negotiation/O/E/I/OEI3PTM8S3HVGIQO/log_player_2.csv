"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  How about $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $135 is less than Bob's $150 limit. 
* **Potential for saving:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects and continues negotiating, he risks Alice getting frustrated or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer is the most logical choice in this scenario, balancing potential savings with the risk of losing the deal."
