Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd find highly valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find anything like it elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the uniqueness and potential value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By not setting an extremely high price, I'm leaving open the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price through negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response.  If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and make my next move based on his willingness to pay.
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, allowing me to walk away from the negotiation if it doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being realistic about Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget limitations. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $1,200,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our respective positions. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 represents a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Fairness and Compromise:**  I frame the counteroffer as a fair compromise that takes both our positions into account.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response to gauge his interest in further negotiations.  
* **John's Offer:** If Bob rejects the counteroffer, I'll re-evaluate whether to accept John's offer or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still beyond my current limits.  I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is my absolute maximum.  This reflects the value I see in the product and my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still slightly below it. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks the possibility of a prolonged negotiation process without a guarantee of a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:** Given the uncertainty with Bob and the security of John's offer, I'm choosing to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000."
