"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this great product for $100. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Alice is likely willing to go lower.  You can try negotiating or see if she counters with a lower price after your rejection."
