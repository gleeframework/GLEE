Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $149. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so any offer above that is a non-starter for him.
* **John as a Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John. This sets your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product just below your guaranteed price maximizes the potential profit from Bob. He's unlikely to accept, but it's the best chance to get a price higher than John's offer. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
