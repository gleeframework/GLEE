"I'm really interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $850000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
