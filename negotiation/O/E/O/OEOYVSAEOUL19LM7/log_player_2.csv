"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $85 is a fair starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above the product's worth to her.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and it's even higher than her initial offer.  I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get a better deal before I have to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to go higher than her initial offer, I'm going to slightly increase my counteroffer to $87. This shows that I'm open to compromise but still pushing for a price closer to her value. I want to see if we can find common ground without having to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her price, which is getting closer to John's offer.  However, I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get a price closer to my ideal value.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer gives me another chance to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price.  I'm raising my counteroffer to $89, which is still below her last offer but represents a significant increase from my previous one. This signals my willingness to compromise while keeping the price within my budget. I'm hoping this will convince Alice to accept the deal before I have to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97 is just too close to John's offer of $100.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's a good chance she'll keep raising her price, and I might end up paying more than I'm willing to for the product. Buying from John ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's not the absolute best deal."
