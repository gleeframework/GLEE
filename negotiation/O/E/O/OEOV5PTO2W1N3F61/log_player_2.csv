"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $8,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's counteroffer of $9,250 is closer to Bob's desired price point of $9,000, and it's still cheaper than buying from John for $10,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
