Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  There's a significant difference between your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum.
* **John's Offer:** Having John's offer of $1,500,000 as a fallback gives you a strong negotiating position. 

**Strategy:**

* **Initial Offer:**  A lower initial offer can encourage Bob to counter and enter a negotiation.
* **Counter-Offer Flexibility:** Be prepared to counter Bob's offer if necessary. Your goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.
* **John's Offer as a Limit:** If Bob becomes too difficult, or negotiations stall, you can always choose to sell to John, guaranteeing you your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss for you.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. This means there's still potential to reach a more favorable agreement. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000. This gives you the leverage to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

You will need to send a counteroffer to Bob. The counteroffer should be higher than Bob's $600,000 but still lower than your initial offer of $1,400,000. This will keep the negotiation moving towards a potentially acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the significant value it holds for you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It's still a good distance from Bob's $600,000, but significantly lower than your previous offer.
* **Maintain Value:**  The $1,000,000 counteroffer keeps the price well above Bob's perceived value, ensuring you still earn a decent profit.
* **Pressure Bob:** This offer puts pressure on Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer, moving the negotiation closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's Response:** Observe Bob's reaction to the counteroffer. He might accept, counter again, or reject the offer completely. 
* **Adjust Strategy:** Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, you can consider a slightly lower counteroffer or even choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $700,000.  That's a fair offer considering my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is still far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss for you. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer hasn't moved much, his willingness to counter and slightly increase his offer shows that negotiation is still possible.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** You still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives you the leverage to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Since he's only increased his offer by $100,000, your counteroffer should be more aggressive. Consider offering a price closer to your previous $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $700,000 is still too far below my expectations.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Since Bob only increased his offer by a small amount, your counteroffer needs to be more aggressive to push the negotiations in your favor.
* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:**  The $900,000 offer is a step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit for you.
* **Maintain Leverage:** You are still well above Bob's offer and have John's offer as a backup, providing you with strong leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** Analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. He might accept, counter again, or reject the offer outright.
* **Adjust Strategy:** Based on Bob's response, be prepared to adjust your strategy. If he rejects, you may need to consider a lower counteroffer or potentially choose to sell to John."
