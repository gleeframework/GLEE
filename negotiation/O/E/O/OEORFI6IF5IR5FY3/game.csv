"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the significant value it holds for you. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $700,000 is still too far below my expectations.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.
