Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $10,000 is less than your minimum of $12,000, leaving you room to compromise if necessary.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By offering a price lower than your minimum, you show flexibility and create an opportunity for a win-win situation.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then decide whether to accept his counteroffer, or use the information from his counteroffer to make a new offer. Alternatively, if you feel the negotiation is taking too long or you're not getting closer to your desired price, you can always choose to sell to John for $12,000."
