Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair price considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation if needed but still aims high. 
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""potential"" and ""benefits"" attempts to pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics about why the product is worth so much to you.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it's still significantly below your guaranteed sale price to John. This leaves you space to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob counters, maximizing your potential profit. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have limited information about Bob's negotiation style and willingness to pay."
