{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to go lower. Remember, you can always counteroffer or sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm really interested in your product, but I'd be happy to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $8250?  I'm confident we can make this work.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$8,250 is above my minimum price of $8,000, and it seems like Bob is serious about making a deal. It's a good compromise and I'm willing to accept it."
