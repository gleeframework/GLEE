"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still a significant amount over Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the first offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value we've both assessed, I'd like to offer $850,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profitable deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This offer reflects the product's value while still allowing you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $925,000 is still too high, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This offer is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while allowing us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 900000}
