"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm quite interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, I believe.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,750 is still a bit below my target. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a small increase, but it's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
