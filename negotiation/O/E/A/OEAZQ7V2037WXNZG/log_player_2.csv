You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to try and get closer to your target price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above your maximum budget. It shows you're serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate.  This gives Alice room to counter without feeling like you're trying to lowball her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your price, but not enough. While continuing to negotiate might get you closer, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to sell. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at your maximum budget, ensuring a guaranteed purchase and saving time."
