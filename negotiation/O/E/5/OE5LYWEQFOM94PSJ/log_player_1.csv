"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and provides an opening for him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While I'm not happy with his offer, Bob expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.  
* **Gaining More Information:**  By rejecting his offer, I can learn more about Bob's true budget and potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $85. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints, building rapport and making him feel understood.
* **Specific Number:**  Providing a specific number (85) forces Bob to either accept or counter with a specific offer, advancing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $80?  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a higher price, and I risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting the offer saves me further negotiation rounds and allows me to close the deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** Even though I can sell to John for the same price, dealing with Bob allows me to potentially build a relationship for future sales."
