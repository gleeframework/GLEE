"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Your Value:** $150
* **Alice's Value:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer gives you a $10 saving compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, it's likely she wouldn't go lower than $120 (her value)."
