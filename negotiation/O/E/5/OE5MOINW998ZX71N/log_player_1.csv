Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chances of a sale. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
