Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:**  While not giving away that your minimum is $120, the phrase ""willing to part with it"" suggests it might be worth even more to you, subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone even higher. If he rejects, you still have room to negotiate down to your minimum."
