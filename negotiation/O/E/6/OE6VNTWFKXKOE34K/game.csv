"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you showing me the product. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my absolute maximum is $85. Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $100, which would be $92.50. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can reach a deal. $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if it works for you.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, which would be $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,7,
