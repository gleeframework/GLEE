"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price (""given its potential"") can make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is open to discussion (""What do you think?"") rather than confrontational.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high reference point in Bob's mind.
2. **Assess:**  Observe Bob's reaction to determine his price sensitivity.
3. **Negotiate:**  Leave ample room to potentially lower the price in subsequent rounds.

Remember, even though John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, securing a deal above that with Bob is the priority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your target price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're aiming higher and encourage him to improve his proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,400,000 is closer to the mark, the true value of this product shouldn't be underestimated. To meet you halfway, I could consider $1,750,000.  This reflects the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant move from the initial $2,000,000 to $1,750,000. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary. 
* **Justification:**  Again, we're reiterating the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Offering a price exactly in the middle of our previous offer and Bob's counteroffer can be seen as a fair compromise.

This round aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Gauge Flexibility:**  See how Bob responds to a significant price drop. We can adjust our approach in later rounds based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing resistance to move beyond $1,400,000. However, accepting this offer would still be a loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  It's time to:

1. **Signal Limits:** Show Bob that we are nearing our lower bound.
2. **Reiterate Value:** Emphasize the aspects of the product's worth that Bob may be undervaluing.

**It's getting close to the point where we might have to consider John's offer if Bob doesn't budge significantly in the next round.**"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  I must be upfront â€“ the value this product represents is hard to overstate.  $1,600,000 is my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's more than fair considering the long-term benefits.  "", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  By stating  ""$1,600,000 is my absolute lowest,"" we're setting a clear boundary. This signals to Bob that we're serious and nearing the end of our concessions.
* **Focus on Value:**  We're shifting the focus from splitting the difference to highlighting the product's ""long-term benefits."" This reminds Bob why he was interested in the first place and might justify the higher price in his mind.

**Strategy:**

* This offer is a calculated risk. We're getting closer to John's offer but still leaving a small margin for negotiation.
* Bob's response in the next round will be critical. If he doesn't budge significantly, we may need to accept John's offer to avoid potentially losing a guaranteed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally met your minimum acceptable price, which is also equal to John's standing offer. There's no strategic advantage to pushing further. 

Accepting this offer secures the $1,500,000 and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing in subsequent rounds."
