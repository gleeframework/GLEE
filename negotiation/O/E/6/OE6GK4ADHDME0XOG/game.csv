"Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  While $65 is below what I need to sell it for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it offers.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $85 is still a bit much for me. I could do $78, final offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
