"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. How about $110? I'm really keen on this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's meet in the middle!",110.0,Bob,6,
