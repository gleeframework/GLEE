"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it holds immense value for you.  To start the negotiation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Leaving Room for Discussion:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation. This prevents alienating Bob with an overly aggressive initial offer.
* **Strategic Timing:**  With 10 rounds available, I have time to negotiate strategically. If Bob outright rejects this high starting point, I can adjust in subsequent rounds.  However, if he counters, it provides valuable information about his potential willingness to go higher than $1,200,000.
* **John as Backup:** While I'm aiming to maximize profit, I'm aware that John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. I'll keep this in mind throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is already above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for him to go higher.
* **Below My Minimum:** While closer, his offer is still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting his offer signals that I'm serious about getting a price that reflects the product's value. It also keeps the negotiation active, allowing me to potentially secure an even better deal.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer that falls between $1,300,000 and $1,500,000. My aim is to gradually guide the negotiation toward a price that is mutually beneficial, but with me securing a significant portion of the potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the product's value is considerably higher than your current proposal. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects a more accurate price point for the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've made a significant move down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. The new price of $1,750,000 is roughly halfway between Bob's offer ($1,300,000) and my starting point ($2,000,000).
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  Importantly, this counteroffer remains comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, I'm reinforcing that my price is based on objective worth, not just arbitrary negotiation tactics.

**Goal:** I'm aiming to create a sense that this counteroffer is a balanced and fair compromise. My hope is that Bob will counter with a price closer to my target range, or at the very least, continue the negotiation, allowing for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still too far from my budget. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,500,000. This is a fair price, considering both our perspectives on the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Position:**  By ""splitting the difference,"" Bob has signaled that this price is likely close to his upper limit. Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher amount, but the risk of losing the deal increases substantially.
* **John's Offer:** While I could walk away and sell to John for the same price, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a slight risk of him lowering his offer or walking away. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $1,500,000 secures a profitable outcome, meets my minimum target, and avoids the potential risks of prolonged negotiation."
