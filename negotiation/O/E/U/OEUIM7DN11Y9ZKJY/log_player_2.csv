Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly exceptional. Considering its value and quality, I'm extending this offer at $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we set the price at $9,250? This allows us to both benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still outside my price range. I'm happy to pay $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
