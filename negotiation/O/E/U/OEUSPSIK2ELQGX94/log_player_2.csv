"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, while still leaving room for negotiation. This price is also well below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and is closer to the value of the product to Alice ($8,000).  It's likely that Alice will not go lower, making it a good deal for Bob.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
