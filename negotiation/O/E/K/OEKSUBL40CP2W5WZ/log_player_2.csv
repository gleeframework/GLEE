"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($10,000). There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $11,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,250 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than the price Bob would be willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I was thinking we could go a bit higher. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's the same price I initially offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already negotiated the price down to $11,000, which is the same price Alice initially offered.  While Bob might prefer a lower price, he's already close to his target.  If he rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice will stick to her price or even increase it.  Buying from John would be more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
