"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first.  $13,000 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also keeps the price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $10,000. How about we try $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair price to me."",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm price closer to my ideal.  Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $11,000 is a good one, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we try $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly committed to getting a price above $12,000.  While $12,250 isn't a terrible price, I think one more counter might get her closer to $12,000.  I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is really the highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to make the deal."",
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is my final offer. It meets Alice's apparent minimum price while staying within my budget. If she rejects this, I'll buy from John."
