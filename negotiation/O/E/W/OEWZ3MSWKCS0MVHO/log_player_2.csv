Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy we're finding common ground.  To be fair, I can't go lower than $130.  It's a great price for this.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go below $130, and you have a guaranteed option with John for $120. It makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $10."
