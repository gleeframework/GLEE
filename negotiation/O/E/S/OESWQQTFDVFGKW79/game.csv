"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $180 is a bit steep for me. How about $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140.  If you're not able to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise at $160, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",160.0,Alice,5,
