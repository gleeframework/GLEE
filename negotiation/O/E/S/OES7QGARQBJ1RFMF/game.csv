"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $8,400. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,400 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,100 for the product, which is closer to what I'm able to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we're both placing on this product.",8100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but I'd like to add a slight premium for the convenience and exclusivity of this deal. I can offer you a price of $8,200. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $8,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8000.0,Bob,6,
