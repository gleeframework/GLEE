{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and keeps the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my desired selling point."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging on his offer of $105, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
