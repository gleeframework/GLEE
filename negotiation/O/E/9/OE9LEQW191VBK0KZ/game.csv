"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm offering $1,350,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,250,000 or lower. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
