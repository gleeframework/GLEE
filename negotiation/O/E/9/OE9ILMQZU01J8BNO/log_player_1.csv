"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. This is a bold move, but it might incentivize Bob to counter-offer quickly, allowing us to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000, which is still significantly higher than my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a fair price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum, and we're getting closer to my desired price.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
