"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your asking price.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
