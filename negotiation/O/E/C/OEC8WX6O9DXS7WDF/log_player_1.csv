Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so I will try to get closer to that price before considering selling to John. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,100? It's a fair price, and it would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,600. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will go any higher, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John for $10,000 is the best option to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
