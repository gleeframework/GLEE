,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider it?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,100? It's a fair price, and it would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,600. Can you consider it?",9600.0,Bob,6,
