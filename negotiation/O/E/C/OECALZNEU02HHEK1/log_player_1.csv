This is a tough call, but with only one round left, I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is very tempting, I'm not sure I can push him higher in this last round.  Selling to John ensures I get at least my minimum asking price and allows me to avoid the risk of getting nothing if I reject Bob's offer."
