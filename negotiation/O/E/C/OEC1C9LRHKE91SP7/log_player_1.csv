Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to sell it for a loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 8500}
