"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Openness:** The message expresses willingness to negotiate, which might make Bob more likely to engage.
* **No specific value:** I'm not revealing my true value for the product. This helps keep Bob guessing and might make him more likely to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He's shown interest, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Leveraging the negotiation process:** Rejecting his offer allows me to use the negotiation process to potentially achieve a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have multiple rounds remaining, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000 to finalize the deal. This gives you a good value, and allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Highlighting value:** I mention ""good value"" to subtly emphasize the worth of the product. 
* **Clear next step:** I explicitly ask for Bob's response to encourage a quick decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $9000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:**  Bob has moved closer to my desired price. This offer is significantly better than his initial $8,000 and is only $500 away from my ideal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will become less willing to compromise. Additionally, the value difference between $8,500 and my minimum of $8,000 is relatively small.
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures a good price with less potential risk of ending up with a worse outcome."
