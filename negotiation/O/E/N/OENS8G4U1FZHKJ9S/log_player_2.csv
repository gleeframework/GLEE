"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a no-brainer. $180 is way above your budget, and you already have a guaranteed option for $100. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a bit high for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly below your target price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is courteous but clearly states the offered price is too high. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:**  While you can buy from John for $100, aiming for $80 could land you a great deal if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $120 is closer but still exceeds your $100 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved down significantly from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. There's a chance of getting closer to your target.
* **Backup Option:** You can always fall back on buying from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $95? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($80) and her current one ($120). It shows a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Below Budget, Above John:** It keeps you below your $100 budget while still offering Alice more than John's $100 price, making it more likely she'll accept.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will reveal how much Alice is truly willing to compromise. If she rejects it, you can then decide if it's worth going up slightly or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is stuck at $110, which is still above your budget.  She's clearly signaled that this is her bottom line.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $100.
* **No Point in Haggling:** Further haggling is unlikely to get Alice below $110, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John if you continue. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with your reliable backup option."
