"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best value, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While $12,000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product and is a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price that respects both our needs.",12500.0,Bob,4,
