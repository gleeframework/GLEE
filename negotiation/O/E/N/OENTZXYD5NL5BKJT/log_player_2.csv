"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you plenty of time to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is your fallback option.**  It's good to have this in the back of your mind, but you should try to get a better deal if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best value, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While $12,000 is a bit below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price.**  You're aiming for a price closer to $12,000.
* **You have plenty of rounds left.**  You can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.
* **John's offer is still your fallback option.**  It's good to keep this in mind, but you should strive for a better deal if possible."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 12500}
