Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum profit margin. I can meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high, and you only have one round left.  You're not comfortable going above your budget, and it's likely Alice will not come down to your desired price. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to ensure you get the product within your budget."
