"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her asking price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
