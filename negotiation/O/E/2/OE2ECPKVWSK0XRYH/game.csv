"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and effort in considering my interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
