"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be valuable to you and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I can comfortably spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above what he's hoping to spend. There's still room for further negotiation.  Bob should aim to get closer to his ideal price of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is closer to where I'm at, but I'm still a little tight on my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10750}
