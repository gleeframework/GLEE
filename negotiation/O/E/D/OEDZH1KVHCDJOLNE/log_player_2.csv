Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough. Considering the value I have in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value I have in mind, and it's still a discount from my initial offer.
