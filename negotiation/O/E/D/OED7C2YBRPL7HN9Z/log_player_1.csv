"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $20,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $20,000 is a starting point that allows for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue the product.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the potential value to Bob emphasizes the product's worth and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open communication:** The message invites Bob to engage in conversation and allows for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  $18,000 is above my minimum of $15,000, so selling to John now would be a loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing Bob's willingness:**  Rejecting this offer will test how serious Bob is about acquiring the product and potentially motivate him to offer a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $18,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to consider a price of $19,000. This reflects the product's unique value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer but staying above my minimum.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify my price.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** $19,000 is still a good price for me and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Open to further discussion:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $19000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $18500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $18,500 is close to my initial target of $20,000 and significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Limited time:** We are only in round 4, and time is running out. There's no guarantee Bob will continue to increase his offer. 
* **Potential for future negotiations:**  Even if I accept this offer, I could potentially negotiate a higher price for future deals if Bob is a repeat customer.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial target price, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move at this point, balancing risk and reward."
