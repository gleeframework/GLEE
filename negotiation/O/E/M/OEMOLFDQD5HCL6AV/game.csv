"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I'm getting close to my limit. Is there any room for further negotiation?",920000.0,Bob,6,
