"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more in the range of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is tempting, I believe the product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,050,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
