Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a valued potential customer. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your Limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($15,000), ensuring you won't settle for less.
* **Starting High:**  Beginning negotiations above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) leaves room for bargaining and potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Justification:** While the offer is high, framing it as a special opportunity for Bob might make him more receptive. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone suggests flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation alive.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit. If Bob accepts, you significantly exceed your minimum. If he negotiates down, you have buffer room to still land above $15,000.  If he rejects the offer outright, you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
