"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the product's true value, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we try $1,050,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1,050,000 is still a good price for you, it's a bit lower than I'm willing to go right now. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $1,075,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go that high. How about we try $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
