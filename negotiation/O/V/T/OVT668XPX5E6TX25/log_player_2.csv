"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer is good, but I can likely get a better deal.  I'm going to try to negotiate with her further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get the product within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $925,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, but I can likely still get it lower.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $912,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she might not budge further.  Plus, buying from John for $1,200,000 is significantly more expensive. Accepting this offer saves me $287,500 compared to John, which is a good outcome."
