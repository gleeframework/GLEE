"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

At this point, Alice has met your upper limit. There's no point in continuing the negotiation since you can buy from John at this price anyway.  Accepting now secures the deal."
