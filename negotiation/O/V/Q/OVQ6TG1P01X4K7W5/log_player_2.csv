# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and while I could counter again, the difference is getting smaller.  $1,125,000 is a decent price and it's not worth the risk of her going up from there."
