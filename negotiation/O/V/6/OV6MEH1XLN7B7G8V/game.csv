"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal considering the value it holds for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about $105? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $108. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $108. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from it.",108.0,Alice,5,
