{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to capitalize on his interest.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a great product, but $120 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $100.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and it seems he's ready to buy now.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale than risk further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to John."
