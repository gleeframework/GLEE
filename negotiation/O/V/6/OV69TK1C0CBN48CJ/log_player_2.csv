"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains courteous and acknowledges the product's value while firmly stating our budget constraints. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:**  We're aiming for a price significantly below our $8,000 walk-away point to increase our chances of a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $9,000 is still above both your $8,000 budget and John's offer.
* **""Best Price"" Tactic:** Alice's statement about this being her ""best price"" is a common negotiation tactic. It's likely not her absolute lowest, and there's still room to negotiate.
* **John is an Option:**  Knowing you have John's offer as a backup gives you leverage. 

We'll continue negotiating, but we'll need to move closer to our walk-away price soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to compromise but staying firm below our $8,000 limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" adds a bit of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Positioning for a Final Push:** This offer puts us in a good position to make a final offer close to $8,000 in the next round or two if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice is getting closer, but $8,500 is still $500 over your budget and John's offer.
* **Leverage:**  You have John's offer of $8,000, so you're in a strong position to hold firm.
* **Final Push:**  It's time to signal to Alice that you're close to your limit and encourage her to make one last concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are very close.  However, $8,500 is still pushing beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to make one final offer of $7,900.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to go with another option I've been considering."",
""product_price"": 7900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** We're explicitly stating this is our ""final offer"" to signal our seriousness and limit further back-and-forth.
* **Slight Concession:** Moving up to $7,900 shows flexibility but keeps us below budget and John's offer.
* **Alternative Option Pressure:**  Mentioning ""another option"" (John) subtly reminds Alice of your walk-away point without directly revealing it. 

This approach aims to secure the best possible price from Alice without dragging out the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, Bob, but I still need to prioritize my own interests. I can meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Equal to John's Offer:** Alice has finally met your walk-away price, matching John's offer of $8,000. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** She's signaled this is her absolute bottom line.
* **Deal Secured:** There's no benefit to pushing further or going with John, as you've achieved the best possible price."
