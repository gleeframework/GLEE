"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, while also being closer to your initial offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
