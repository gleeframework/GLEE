"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $10000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $8500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $9250?  I believe this is a fair price for the value the product will bring you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your initial price, but $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8750?  I'm eager to purchase this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
