Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with an offer of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting position.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. This can help create a more positive environment for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting high, I allow Bob to make counteroffers without immediately reaching my minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an initial offer. The best strategy will depend on Bob's reaction and the flow of the negotiation. 
* I will be keeping track of my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and the value of the product to John ($8,000) throughout the negotiation.
* I am ready to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses. If he is unwilling to negotiate, I can always sell to John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $10000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not good enough:** While $8,500 is above my minimum value, it's still lower than I'd like to get. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle just yet.
* **Strategy:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This will show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also that I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000 or $9,500. I'll carefully consider his initial offer and my overall negotiation goals to make a strategic counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,250?  I believe this is a fair price for the value the product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still seeking a good price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value the product will bring Bob. This subtly reminds him of the benefits he'll gain, potentially increasing his willingness to pay.
* **Staying above the minimum:** My counteroffer of $9,250 remains significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me some buffer in case Bob negotiates further.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** I'll closely watch Bob's response to my counteroffer. His reaction will guide my next move in the negotiation.
* **Prepared for a counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer or potentially adjust my strategy if necessary.
* **Keep John in mind:** I'll remember that I can always sell the product to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your initial price, but $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8750?  I'm eager to purchase this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the target:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's also a reasonable compromise, considering our previous negotiations.
* **Avoiding further negotiations:**  While I could try to squeeze out a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower offer or a breakdown is significant. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale.  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out and potentially lead to a less favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the deal:** I'll confirm with Bob to finalize the purchase and arrange for the product to be transferred.
* **Reflecting on the negotiation:**  I'll review the negotiation process to identify any areas where I could have been more effective or strategies I can apply in future negotiations."
