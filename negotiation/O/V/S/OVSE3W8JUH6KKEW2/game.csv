"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you're the only other interested buyer.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree on. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a quick and smooth transaction. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
