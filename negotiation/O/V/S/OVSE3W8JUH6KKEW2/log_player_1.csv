"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below the product's worth to both of us. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a quick and smooth transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
