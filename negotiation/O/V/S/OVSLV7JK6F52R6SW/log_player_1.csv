"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm also leaving myself room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm counter-offering with $13,000, which is still higher than my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price. This shows firmness while also signaling my willingness to close the deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is still slightly below my initial minimum, it's only $1,000 less. It's a good price considering that I only have 4 more rounds left.  I'd rather take the sure thing now, rather than risk losing out and having to sell to John for a lower price."
