Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to still get a great deal even if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price well above Bob's perceived value, you can gauge how interested he truly is. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a fantastic profit. If he negotiates, you can still likely settle above your minimum.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows you to be more confident in your initial offer to Bob."
