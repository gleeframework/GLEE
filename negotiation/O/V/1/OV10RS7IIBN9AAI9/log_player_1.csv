Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but she needs to leave Bob some room for profit to incentivize him to buy.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,400,000 shows Alice is serious but open to negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, even though John would pay the full price. Bob doesn't know that.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price attractive to Bob and maximizing Alice's profit."
