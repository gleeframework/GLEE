"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a little bit more.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but $105 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",90.0,Bob,6,
