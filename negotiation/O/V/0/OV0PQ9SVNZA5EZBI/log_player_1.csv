"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob wants to counter, but it's also a fair price considering my minimum value is $100. I'm confident we can reach an agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a little more, but I'm still comfortable with this price if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $125 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale. With only 6 rounds left, I want to secure a sale and avoid having to sell to John for a lower price."
