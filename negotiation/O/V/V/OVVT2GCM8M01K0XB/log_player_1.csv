"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe the product is worth a lot to me, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Bob's offer is too low. We have room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

We're getting closer, but $10,500 is still less than what John is offering. We can afford to push a bit further in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle on $12,000? That's a strong offer and reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While we could push for the full $12,000, Bob is unlikely to go higher given his ""final offer"" statement. Accepting $11,500 is still a better outcome than John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
