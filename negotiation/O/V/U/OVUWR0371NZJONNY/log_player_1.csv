"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $170, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know that I'm willing to negotiate, which could make him more likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $130 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, I still see room for negotiation. There are 8 rounds left, and I can try to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. 
* **Avoiding the John option:**  While selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $130 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $155.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to My Minimum:** I'm proposing $155, which is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't go much lower.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and open to a compromise.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize that my counteroffer is a compromise from my initial price, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $140 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, there are still 6 rounds remaining. I can try to push for a slightly higher price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Although John offers a guaranteed $150, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $145. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing $145 as a fair price for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Closing Statement:** I add a closing statement to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We are down to 4 rounds, and it seems unlikely that Bob will increase his offer.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

Although I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of continuing with Bob is too high. With limited rounds left, John's offer provides a safe and guaranteed solution."
