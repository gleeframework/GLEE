"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $85 price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $92, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  $91 is my final offer.  It's a fair deal for both of us and will allow us to close this quickly.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already given you a great deal, and I think $92 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to negotiate further, but I'm still open to discussing other terms if you'd like.",92.0,Alice,7,
