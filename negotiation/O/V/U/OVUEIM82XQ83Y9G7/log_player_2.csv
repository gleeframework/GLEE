"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a great deal. I'm willing to let it go for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be reasonable while also aiming for a significant discount. He's offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This should incentivize Alice to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $85 price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and shouldn't settle unless he's confident he can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to stay persistent, but he's also being pragmatic.  He's offering a price that's just slightly lower than Alice's last offer, indicating his willingness to meet halfway, but still within his target range.  This should encourage Alice to accept or counter with a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $92, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice has shown willingness to compromise, the offer is still above Bob's target.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  $91 is my final offer.  It's a fair deal for both of us and will allow us to close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 91} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his desired price, but he wants to make sure he's getting the best possible deal. He's offering a price that's only slightly lower than Alice's previous offer, but it's still within his target range. This should push Alice to either accept the offer or come down even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already given you a great deal, and I think $92 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to negotiate further, but I'm still open to discussing other terms if you'd like. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated she won't go lower than $92, and Bob has already made his final offer at $91.  The negotiation seems to have stalled.  Given that Bob has only 3 rounds left, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $100 rather than risk getting stuck with Alice's offer.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, ensuring the purchase without further negotiation."
