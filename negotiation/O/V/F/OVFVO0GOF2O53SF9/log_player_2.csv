"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We're starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This offer is closer to Alice's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $8,200. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Her ""one-time offer"" tactic shouldn't deter us from negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,600?"",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

We're splitting the difference between our last offer and her current one. This shows willingness to compromise while still working towards a desirable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $8,000 mark. While we could likely push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming marginal. Accepting at $8,100 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
