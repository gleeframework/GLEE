Alice's offer:

It's getting too risky now. Alice is clearly holding firm on getting a decent profit. If we continue haggling, we risk her walking away or ending up at a price that's not significantly better than John's offer. $1,090,000 is a decent price considering our limit and the time spent negotiating."
