"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $80, and Alice's offer is too high. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my max is $80.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is your maximum, but I was thinking of a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to your maximum, it's still a bit too high. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $85. It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $87? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $87 is still above your maximum price point of $80. At this stage, it's more beneficial to buy from John. You've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $87. You've established your boundaries, and John is a sure thing for the price you're willing to pay."
