,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my max is $80.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is your maximum, but I was thinking of a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $85. It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $87? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair middle ground.",87.0,Alice,5,
