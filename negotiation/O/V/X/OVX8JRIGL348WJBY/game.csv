"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? ",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today if we can agree on a price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
