"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and would be a great addition to your collection. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $10,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  I'm sure we can reach a fair agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject any lower counteroffer and he'll be stuck with the more expensive option from John. Accepting $11,000 allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to John."
