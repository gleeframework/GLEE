"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

Let's start by offering Alice a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer.  This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's keep negotiating. We're getting closer to a price I'm happy with, and I'm confident we can find a better deal than $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
``` 

Let's try a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous offer but still lower than Alice's offer.  This will show her I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still aiming for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is only $500 more than my last counteroffer. At this point, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation. I can save $174,500 compared to buying from John, and I'm comfortable with the price."
