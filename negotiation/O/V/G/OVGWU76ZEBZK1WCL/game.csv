"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
