Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It allows me to earn more than selling to John while still being potentially attractive to Bob. This approach maximizes my chance of getting a better price than John's offer, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price."
