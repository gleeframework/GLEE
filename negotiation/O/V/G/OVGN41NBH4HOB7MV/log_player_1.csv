"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value of $150 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my desired range in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $135.  This is a compromise, showing willingness to meet him halfway while still ensuring a profit for myself. I believe this will incentivize him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I believe I can still negotiate a price closer to my desired range in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $130.  I'm willing to meet him halfway again, showing flexibility while staying within my desired profit range. I believe this offer is compelling enough to persuade Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and the risk of continuing negotiation is high. I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely and then having to sell to John for a much lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer at $122 is a better strategy at this stage."
