Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000), increasing the chances he'll see it as a good deal if he needs the product.
* **Secure Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
