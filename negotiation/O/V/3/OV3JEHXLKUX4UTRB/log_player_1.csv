"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm interested in closing the deal, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good price considering the product's value.  I'm confident this price is fair, and I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a good price, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,275,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I want to see if we can get a better offer in the next round.  There's still a chance Bob might come up to my desired price, and I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a long-term partnership, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1,290,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time.  Bob's offer is still too low for me, and he seems unwilling to budge much further.  Rather than risk losing even more time and money in negotiations, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is the best option for me at this point to secure a fair price for my product."
