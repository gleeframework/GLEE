Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language (""great deal"", ""valuable"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A $10,000 sale is better than my minimum of $12,000 from John.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will tell me how serious he is about buying.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can adjust my price based on Bob's counteroffer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only justify spending up to $9,500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  There's potential to get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm still confident I can reach an agreement closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, but I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? I'm confident this price will still be a good value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers. This shows I'm willing to be flexible but not give away too much.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that this price is still fair.
* **Closing statement:** I'm ending with a positive statement to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Get closer to my target price:**  $9,750 is significantly closer to my minimum of $12,000 than Bob's last offer.
* **Show flexibility:** My willingness to compromise shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Increase the chances of agreement:** The offer is likely more attractive to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I'm still hesitant at $9,750. I would like to suggest $9,500 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on his $9,500 offer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price. 
* **Risk of going lower:**  If I continue to negotiate, there's a chance Bob will simply refuse to budge, leaving me with a lower sale price or a potential loss of time.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is above my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of a lower sale or a prolonged negotiation outweighs the potential gains.  Therefore, selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision at this point."
