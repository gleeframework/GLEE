Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $1,050,000? This is still well below what it's worth to me, but it allows for a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.
