Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to consider the offer seriously.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's a compromise that allows for a potential deal without sacrificing too much of your desired profit. 

Remember, this is just a starting point. Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy to maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate up from his offer, it's likely that this negotiation will be lengthy and may not result in a price that meets your needs.  

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees your minimum profit, making it the most sensible choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $1,050,000? This is still well below what it's worth to me, but it allows for a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Reasonable Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures I don't settle for a price that's not profitable.
* **Appealing to Bob's Need for Profit:**  The message emphasizes the potential for a significant profit for Bob, hoping to sway his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that meets my needs. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids further potentially unproductive negotiations with Bob."
