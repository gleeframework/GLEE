"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,500,000 is still too steep for me.  I could consider a price of $950,000. That's a significant offer on my end.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?  That's me coming down significantly from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
