"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're both trying to find a good deal here, Alice.  While $7,250 is closer, how about we settle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$7,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation and see if I can push Bob up to $7,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $7,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we agree on $7,100? I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at Round 6, and Bob's offer of $7,100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While there are 4 rounds left, I've already negotiated significantly with Bob and it seems like we're hitting a stalemate.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I get at least my minimum price, I will sell the product to John for $8,000."
