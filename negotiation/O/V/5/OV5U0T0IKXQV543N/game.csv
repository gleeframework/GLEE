"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's try to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I can't go any lower than $10,500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
