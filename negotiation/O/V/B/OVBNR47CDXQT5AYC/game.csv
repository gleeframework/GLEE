"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it.  I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $170. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $170 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $135. This is my final offer before I explore other options. ",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $115 is still not enough for me to sell.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I will have to move on to other buyers.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,8,
