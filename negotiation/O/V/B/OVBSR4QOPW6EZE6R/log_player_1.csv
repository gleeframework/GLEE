"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects its true value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, making it more attractive.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to keep in mind that I have a backup option with John, who is willing to buy for $800,000. This knowledge empowers me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe that's a fair price for the product based on my research. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident in the product's value and believe a price closer to $900,000 is more appropriate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $900,000.
* **Maintain value:** I still emphasize the product's value and justify my offer.
* **Meeting halfway:** By suggesting I'm ""meeting halfway,"" I imply that this is a fair compromise, making it more likely for Bob to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I conclude with an open-ended statement, inviting further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We're only in round 4 out of 10, and continuing to negotiate with Bob could risk further lowering the price.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is a safe and secure option compared to continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'm hopeful to get a better price, the risk of Bob continuing to lower his offer is too high. Selling to John at this point is the most sensible choice to ensure I achieve my minimum profit goal."
