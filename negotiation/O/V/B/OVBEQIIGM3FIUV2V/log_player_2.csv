"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than you have to."
