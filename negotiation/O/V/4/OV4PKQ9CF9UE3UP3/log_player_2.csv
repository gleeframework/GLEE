"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal and it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
