"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer, which would be $837,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",837500.0,Alice,5,
