Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Alice's final offer is still too high for me.  While it's closer to my budget, I'm better off buying from John for $800,000. It's a significant savings, and I'm confident I'll be happy with the product."
