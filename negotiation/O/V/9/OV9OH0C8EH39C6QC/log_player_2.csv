"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is less than the $150 from John, you can still potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $100 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $125, but still leaves some room for negotiation as it's more than the product's worth to Alice. This counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate while still aiming to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than my desired price.  While it's lower than John's price, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get the price lower than $130 by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to get the price lower. This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This should increase the chances of Alice accepting the deal, but still allows me to save a decent amount of money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $135, which is higher than my last counteroffer of $115. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the price won't go down significantly.  Since John is offering the product for $150, and I'm willing to pay that, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
