"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $1000000? This still gives you a significant advantage over your current resources, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet at $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, but $950000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you'll be happy with in the long run.",975000.0,Alice,5,
