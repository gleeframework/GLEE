Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, should he counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($120), making it essential to highlight the product's benefits in your message. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit."
