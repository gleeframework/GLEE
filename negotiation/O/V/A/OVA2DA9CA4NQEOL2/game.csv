"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, considering the potential returns and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $2,000,000 is my ideal target, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal.  While $1,750,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This price reflects a good compromise and represents a fair value for the product.  Let's make this happen!",1450000.0,Bob,4,
