"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. My asking price is $13500, which I believe is a fair value given its benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $13,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to offer you $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12500? It's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John for the same price, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
