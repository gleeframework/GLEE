,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to pay $105. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get as close to the $150 value you mentioned earlier as possible. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
