Bob can do better than $12,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely still get a better price by making a counteroffer. He might be able to negotiate down to something closer to his initial $10,000 offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there.

Alice is now offering $14,000, which is only $1,000 less than what John is selling it for. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point. Bob should just buy from John and save himself the time and effort."
