Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:**  By starting at $1,200,000, I leave space for Bob to make a counter-offer without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal. 
* **Potential for Success:** There's a good chance Bob will accept or counter-offer, allowing us to negotiate. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm offering a lower price, but still significantly above Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer. 
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. That's still a significant discount from your original price, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower final price, and I'm not confident he'll go much higher.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiations. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit now rather than risking a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
