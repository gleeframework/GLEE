"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To begin negotiations, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair starting point considering my  limits. I'm open to further discussions, but I won't go above this initial offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's significant potential and provides a more realistic foundation for a deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. To make progress, I'm offering $1,000,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to get this deal done.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,650,000 remains outside my budget. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to a deal. Let's aim for a solution that satisfies both of our needs.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge your commitment to this negotiation. While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the value this product brings.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget. To reach a compromise, I'm offering $1,200,000. This price reflects a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value while remaining within my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
