Bob's offer:

This is a fair starting point considering my  limits. I'm open to further discussions, but I won't go above this initial offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow pace.  At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,500,000 minimum.  John represents a guaranteed sale at your desired price, making it the most logical option at this point."
