"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for negotiation room. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and gauge his initial interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair and might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a bit more. We've been negotiating in a relatively narrow range, so I'm hoping to find a sweet spot in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,300,000. I'm feeling confident that we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my lower limit. While I'd love to get more, I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting this offer will secure a deal with Bob and get me closer to my desired price."
