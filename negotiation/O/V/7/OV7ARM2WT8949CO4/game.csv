"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, considering your willingness to negotiate.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $152. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations.",152.0,Alice,5,
