"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
