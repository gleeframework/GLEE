"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $8000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're able to come down to that price, we have a deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really set on getting the product for $8000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
