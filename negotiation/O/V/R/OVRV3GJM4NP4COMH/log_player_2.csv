"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the original price, it's still higher than his budget. He should try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really set on getting the product for $8000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is willing to negotiate further, Bob has already rejected two offers below his desired price point. It's likely that Alice will continue to be firm on her price, and Bob will have to keep rejecting offers, wasting time.  John offers the best price within Bob's budget, and the negotiation with Alice is not showing signs of achieving a mutually acceptable price."
