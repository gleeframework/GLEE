"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking to buy the product for $80 or less, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than your budget. It's better to buy from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
