"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value to me, and it would give you a substantial profit as well. Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
