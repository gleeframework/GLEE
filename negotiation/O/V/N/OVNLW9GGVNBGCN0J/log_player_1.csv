Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value to me, and it would give you a substantial profit as well. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a significant profit.
