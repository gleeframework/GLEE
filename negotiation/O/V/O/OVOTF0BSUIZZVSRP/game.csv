"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $100, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at that price. How about we try to get closer to my original offer, but still compromise a bit? I'm willing to go as low as $115. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",115.0,Alice,5,
