"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping he'll bite or at least give me a strong counteroffer that allows me to gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I can still do better. I want to see if I can push him further towards my desired price point.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a decent profit. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position. If Bob is truly interested, he should be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate.  I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm only slightly above my minimum, Bob's offer is getting close to my ideal price.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to consider the risk of losing the deal altogether.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
