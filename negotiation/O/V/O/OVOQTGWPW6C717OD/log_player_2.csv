"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $107.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107.5 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit high.  Since you have 7 rounds left, you can try to get the price even lower. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $106? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $106, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $108 is still a bit too high.  You've got 5 rounds left to try and get the price down to $105 or less. It's still worth pushing for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm still really interested in the product, but $108 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and I pay $107?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $107, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $109. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Alice is unwilling to go lower than $109.  With only 3 rounds left, the odds of getting the price down to your ideal range are getting slim.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at $120.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still within your budget and ensures you get the product."
