"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $107.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $106? That would be a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $106, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm still really interested in the product, but $108 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and I pay $107?  That feels like a fair compromise.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $107, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $109. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",109.0,Alice,7,
