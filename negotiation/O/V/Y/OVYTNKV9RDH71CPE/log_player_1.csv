Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire it before I open the offer to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,150,000 vs. $1,200,000) creates a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob immediately avoids any potential delays involved in selling to John.

**Important Note:** This assumes you want to conclude the deal quickly. If you have ample time and no immediate need for the $1,200,000, you could start with an even higher offer to Bob and negotiate down."
