Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to acquire this product at a lower price point.  Let's start with $1200000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value this product holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's at my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly,  let's try $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1400000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than my minimum.  There's a good chance I could get a better deal in future rounds, but there's also a risk of Bob walking away entirely. It's better to secure this sale now than risk losing him."
