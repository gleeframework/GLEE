"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we are ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even though he values it at $1,000,000,  our initial offer makes him re-evaluate that worth against the higher number.
* **Leaving Room:** The $1,800,000 offer leaves significant room for negotiation, increasing the chances of reaching a deal within the 10 rounds.

**Important:** We always have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000. This knowledge gives us a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high. I'm more comfortable in the range of $800,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our desired price and even his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. 

It's clear Bob is employing a common negotiation tactic of a low counteroffer after a high initial offer. We need to demonstrate we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. 

We will reject this offer and prepare a strategic counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Value:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but stand firm that $800,000 is too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  We reduce our price by $350,000, a significant drop designed to signal we're willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price, subtly countering Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation too low. 

By moving to $1,450,000, we're aiming for a price closer to our target while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased to $950,000, it's still significantly below our $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial financial loss. 

Bob's incremental increase suggests he's willing to negotiate, but we need to demonstrate we're not going to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's worth. 

We'll reject this offer and use our counteroffer in Round 5 to guide the negotiation closer to a more acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. While I appreciate your offer, we're still quite far apart. To be transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,200,000 for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** We introduce our $1,200,000 minimum, giving Bob a realistic understanding of our position. This builds trust and potentially moves the negotiation forward more efficiently.
* **Compromise:** We propose a significant concession, going below our desired price and meeting Bob exactly halfway between his current offer ($950,000) and our minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Urgency:** By Round 5, introducing a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously as we still have the option to walk away and sell to John.

This offer balances firmness on our minimum with a willingness to compromise, increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
