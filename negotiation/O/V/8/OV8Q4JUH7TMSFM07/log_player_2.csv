"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. While I appreciate your offer, we're still quite far apart. To be transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,200,000 for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,075,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has revealed her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely you'll get significantly below $1,075,000. Accepting this offer saves you $25,000 compared to John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
