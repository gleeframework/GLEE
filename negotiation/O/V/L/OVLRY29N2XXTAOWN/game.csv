"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it still represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a good deal for both of us and would let us move forward with the sale. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
