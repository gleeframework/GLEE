# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

We're still getting a better deal than John's offer. Let's see if we can push Alice a little further down."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me right now. How about we settle at $9,750 and call it a deal?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,200, and it seems she's getting firm on her price. It's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer"" and potentially losing out on John's guaranteed $10,000 price."
