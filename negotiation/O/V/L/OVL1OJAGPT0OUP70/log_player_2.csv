"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and John is selling it at that price, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product immediately from John without risking further negotiation."
