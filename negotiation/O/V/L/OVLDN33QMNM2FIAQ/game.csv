"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me at most.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, though $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $14,000 is still pretty far from what I can afford.  How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a tough pill to swallow, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for you.  That's my bottom line, as I have another buyer interested at that price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
