"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me at most.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, though $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $14,000 is still pretty far from what I can afford.  How about $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a tough pill to swallow, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for you.  That's my bottom line, as I have another buyer interested at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down in price, her ""bottom line"" of $12,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option with John to buy the product for $10,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice when you can get a better deal elsewhere."
