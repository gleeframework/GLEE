Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a small discount while letting you capture a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for $100, ensuring you don't lose out entirely."
