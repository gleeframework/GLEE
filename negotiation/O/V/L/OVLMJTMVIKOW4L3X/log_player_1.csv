Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Setting the price at $1,400,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a net gain.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John gives you leverage. You don't have to settle for anything less than your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, there might be room for Bob to negotiate down slightly. This allows for a potential compromise while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price."
