"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,000. This price reflects its high quality and potential benefits. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure if the product is worth $10000. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I'd ideally want more, Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next rounds, and it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely."
