"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $150 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160. It's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept.  I'm hoping to close the deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $150 becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm finally dropping my price to my minimum of $150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John in the next round to guarantee my minimum profit."
