"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80 for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start significantly lower than Alice's asking price but within our budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals we're serious buyers but looking for a good deal.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating our price limit. 
* **Leaving Room to Move:**  By offering $80, we give ourselves space to negotiate upwards if needed while staying below our $100 maximum.
 
This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure the product at a price far below her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $110 is still above our $100 limit. We need to show Alice we're serious about the lower price but willing to negotiate slightly. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $90?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  We're edging closer to our $100 limit, showing Alice we're willing to compromise. 
* **Firm Limit:** By stating $90 is ""the highest I can go"", we're signaling that this is a serious offer, and further concessions are unlikely.
* **Putting the Ball in Alice's Court:**  This counteroffer encourages Alice to make the final decision â€“ either accept a price close to our target or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $100. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our maximum budget! There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as we've achieved the best possible price. Accepting this offer secures the product at our target price."
