Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $12,000, aiming slightly below that at $11,500 gives you a good chance of securing the sale at a high profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price of $10,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is direct and highlights the product's value while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters."
