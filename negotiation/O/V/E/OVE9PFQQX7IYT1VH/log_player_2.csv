"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm offering you a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. Would you like to make me an offer on it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
