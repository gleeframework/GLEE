"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
