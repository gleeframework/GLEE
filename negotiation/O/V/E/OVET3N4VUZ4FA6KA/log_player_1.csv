Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would $12,000 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much beyond $12,000. Accepting his offer now secures the sale at your minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer and potentially settling for less with another buyer."
