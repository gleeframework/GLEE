"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This would give you a good price and allow me to recover some of the product's value. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. I would like to propose $11000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,
