"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105 just yet. I'm willing to come down to $115, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $110?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115, which would be $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
