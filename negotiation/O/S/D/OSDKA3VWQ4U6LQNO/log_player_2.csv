"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation here. It's worth seeing how low she's willing to go before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product is valuable, but the price needs to work for me too.  How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels like a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer (60% of her initial offer) establishes that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's possible Alice will reject it outright, but it sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** Even if $600,000 is too low for Alice, it gives us space to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I'm keeping John's $800,000 offer in mind as my fallback. I need to make substantial progress with Alice to justify not taking that deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $900,000 is still too high.  We've got time to negotiate, and John's offer provides a good backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see this deal closer to $700,000.  How about $725,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  Alice came down to $900,000, which is halfway between her initial offer and my aggressive counter. I'm countering by splitting the difference between her $900,000 and my $600,000, but adding a little on top to show some flexibility.
* **Time Pressure:** While we're not critically low on time, I want Alice to know I'm serious and have other options. Making a strong counteroffer keeps the momentum going.
* **Backup Plan:**  John's $800,000 offer is looking more and more attractive.  I need to get Alice closer to that range, or I might walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck in a pattern of only meeting in the middle. At this rate, we'll be lucky to get the price down to $825,000, and it's not worth the risk of running out of rounds.  John's $800,000 offer is a sure thing, and at this point, saving the extra $50,000 isn't worth the potential of losing both deals."
