Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This increases his likelihood of accepting the offer. 

I'm aiming to secure a good deal with Bob while keeping John as a backup option if the negotiation falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept an offer that significantly undervalues the product. I'll try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $11,200.  This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us. This helps maintain a positive tone and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob. If not, I'm ready to either continue negotiating or sell the product to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,200. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell the product to me for $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  Considering Bob's resistance and the possibility of further negotiation rounds, accepting his offer seems like the most sensible option. I'd rather secure a sale for a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John at a lower profit margin."
