Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $150, we can see how interested Bob is and how far he might be willing to go. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the option to sell to John for $120, so we don't want to accept anything significantly lower from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is below our minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. We started high, and Bob countered, indicating he's interested. 
* **John as Backup:** We can always fall back on selling to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We came down from $150 to $130, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Profitable:** $130 is still a profitable price for us, exceeding our minimum of $120.
* **Encourages Counter:** This offer encourages Bob to counter again if he's still interested while leaving us room to negotiate further or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is negotiating, the progress is slow, and we're not guaranteed he'll reach our minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at $120, meeting our minimum requirement. 

It's better to take the guaranteed profit with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, which might not even result in a sale."
