``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above the product's value to Bob. This allows for some room to negotiate, and also gives me a higher potential profit. It also shows that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not desperate to accept a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept $900,000, it's below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is tempting, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that low, even though it's closer to my minimum. I will counter again with a slightly lower price but still above my threshold."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. I'd rather sell to Bob at this price than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower amount."
