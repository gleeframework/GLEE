Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for a valuable item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's only $1,000 over his perceived value.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at a price that undervalues the product.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I maintain control of the negotiation. 
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:** $10,500 is a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer. 

Let's see if this time Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000, Bob's offer of $10,250 is within my acceptable range and very close to my last counteroffer.  It's also important to note that I don't want to risk losing this sale entirely.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still profitable for me."
