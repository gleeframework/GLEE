"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $850,000? This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This still leaves room for a reasonable profit for you, while also being within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
