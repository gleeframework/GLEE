"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While Alice is coming down, $16,000 is still over Bob's budget. It's time to counteroffer again and try to get closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my absolute top offer is $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $14,500 is still above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate one more time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is my final offer, and it's the absolute most I can afford."", ""product_price"": 13500}
