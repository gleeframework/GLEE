"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point. I need to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price of $10,000.  There's still room for bargaining, and I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? I'm genuinely interested in the product and would like to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high for me.  While it's getting closer to my target price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more savings. I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal in the remaining rounds.  I still have a few rounds left, so there's time to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above my budget, and we're running out of time.  It's becoming clear that Alice isn't willing to budge much further.  To avoid risking running out of rounds and having to pay a price I'm not comfortable with, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $10,000.  It's the most financially responsible choice at this point."
