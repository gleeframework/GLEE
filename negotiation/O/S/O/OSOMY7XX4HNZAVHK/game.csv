"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12000? I'm genuinely interested in the product and would like to find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $12750? This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
