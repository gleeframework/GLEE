"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for this product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my own budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
