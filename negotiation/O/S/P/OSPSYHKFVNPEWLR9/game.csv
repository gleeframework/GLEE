"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is significantly below my minimum price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit far from my target price. $950000 is closer, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $1050000. This would be a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay, but $1050000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
