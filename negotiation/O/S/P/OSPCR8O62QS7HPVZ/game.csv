"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential you see in this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
