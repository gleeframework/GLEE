Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start significantly higher to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""incredible value,"" and ""potential"" to justify the high asking price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

By starting high, I leave room to negotiate down while still securing a price significantly higher than my minimum. Even if Bob rejects my initial offer, I haven't lost anything and can still sell to John for my desired amount."
