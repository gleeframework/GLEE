"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13000. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $14000, which is my minimum price.

It's a fair price for both of us, and would make this a smooth and quick transaction.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,6,
