"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to us, I'm proposing a price of $140 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice's first offer is quite close to her valuation, leaving little room for negotiation. It's highly likely she's willing to go lower. I'll counteroffer to test the waters. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider something closer to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and our goal to reach an agreement, I am willing to meet you halfway at $125. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. Let's push a bit further and see if we can get closer to $110. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $110?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```tool_code
Reason: We're aiming for a price that's beneficial for us but also reasonable enough for Alice to consider. This keeps the negotiation moving while still trying to achieve a significant discount. 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I propose a price of $115. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

```tool_code
Reason:  Alice has come down considerably, and we're now at a point where the difference between her offer and John's price is relatively small. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $115 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price.
