Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm still open to discussing further.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1300000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the sale at this price.
