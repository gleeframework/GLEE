"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $14,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
