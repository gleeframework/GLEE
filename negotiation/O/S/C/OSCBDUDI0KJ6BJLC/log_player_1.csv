"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and still secure a price higher than my minimum.  I believe Bob will be motivated to buy given the product's value to him, and this price allows for some negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I still have plenty of time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, it's enough to entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000.  I hope this offer is attractive enough to Bob to make a deal."

I'm still confident we can reach a deal that's mutually beneficial. It's getting more risky to reject offers as we run out of rounds, but I'm willing to gamble and see if I can get closer to my target price."
