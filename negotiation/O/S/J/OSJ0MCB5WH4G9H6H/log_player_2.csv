"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. I'm aiming to spend significantly less than $120. It's time to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's still a profitable amount for her. This approach aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price range quickly.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  By starting lower, I leave space for Alice to counter-offer and for us to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Time constraint:** With only 10 rounds, it's important to make substantial moves early on to avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is too low for me. Could you do $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Alice has come down in price, which is a good sign. However, $105 is still above my target price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to meet somewhere between $90 and $105. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still edging closer to my ideal price.  
* **Psychological impact:**  Offering $97 instead of a round number like $95 might make Alice more receptive, as it seems like a more considered offer. 
* **Time pressure:**  With each round, the option of buying from John for $120 becomes more appealing. I need to find a compromise soon."
