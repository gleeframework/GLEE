Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm selling it for $200.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Starting high:** It's always best to start with a price that is higher than your minimum, especially since you don't know Bob's value for the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $200 gives Bob some room to negotiate down if he wants to.  
* **Backup plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John for $150, so you don't have to settle for anything less. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still being open to a deal with Bob."
