{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but significantly less than my minimum. This allows for negotiation space and encourages Bob to engage. I'm aiming to get as close to my $15,000 target as possible without risking Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for that amount.  I will counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price while still being within a range that encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to facilitate this deal.  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too far below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give up on getting closer to my desired price. I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
