"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to facilitate this deal.  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
