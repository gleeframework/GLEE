"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to pay no more than $1,500,000 and her offer is already close to that. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is your fallback.**  You have a safe alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value and potential for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.
* **You have room to negotiate further.**  By rejecting her offer, you can continue to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer remains your safety net.**  You can always switch to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
