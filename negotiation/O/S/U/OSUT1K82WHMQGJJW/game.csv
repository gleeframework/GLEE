"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is a significant discount from my initial price.  Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000. If you're serious about selling this product, let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500.  This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
