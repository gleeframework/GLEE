"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save money, and $12,000 is above his maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's $3,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying but also wants a good deal.  $9,000 is still within his budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $11,000? This is still a great value for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He can likely still negotiate a better price. He's also aware that John is offering the same product for $10,000, so he has a good fallback option if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price point, but still trying to secure a good deal. Offering $10,500 signals that he's serious about buying but also that he won't budge much further.  It leaves a small margin for further negotiation while staying within his budget and closer to John's offer."
