"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $11,000? This is still a great value for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
