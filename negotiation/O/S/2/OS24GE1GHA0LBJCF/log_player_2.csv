Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest and understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to compromise, though, and offer the product to you for $950,000. This price still reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable return on my investment. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What are your thoughts?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $875,000 is still unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.
