"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still slightly out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,650?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",10650.0,Bob,4,
