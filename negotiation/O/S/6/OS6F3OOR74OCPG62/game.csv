,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $80 is all I can afford right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $85.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it today.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $92?  This way, we both get a good deal.",92.0,Alice,5,
