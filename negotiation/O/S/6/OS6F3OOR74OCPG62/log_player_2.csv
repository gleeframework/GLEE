"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a better price than Alice's original value of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product. It's a great deal for you and still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. It's worth trying to see if Alice will come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $80 is all I can afford right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $85.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it today."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $92?  This way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is proving to be more stubborn than anticipated, and the price is still above Bob's comfort zone.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the potential for getting a better price from Alice is decreasing. 

At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for $80. He has already achieved a good deal by securing the product for his maximum price, and he is saving valuable negotiation time."
