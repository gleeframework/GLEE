"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. I'm thinking we can meet in the middle at $9,050. That's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,050 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,950.  If we can agree on that, we can close this deal right now.  Let me know what you think.",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,050 again, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9050.0,Alice,9,
