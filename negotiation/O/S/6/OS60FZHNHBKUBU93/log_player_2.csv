"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but $9,500 is still a significant chunk of that. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room to bargain, and Alice clearly wants to sell.
* **John is a backup.**  Having John as an option provides leverage. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you start the negotiation process. You can counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. It's also reasonable, given your maximum price and Alice's value.
* **Sets the tone:**  By starting with a lower price, you signal that you're willing to bargain and are not afraid to push for a better deal. 
* **Keeps John in mind:** You haven't forgotten about John, which provides you with a strong fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. How about we meet at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While she's come down, $9,000 is still outside of your ideal price range. You're looking to save as much as possible.
* **You have leverage:** You know John is willing to sell for $12,000, giving you a strong fallback position.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Alice is willing to negotiate, which means there's still room for a better deal.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and try to push Alice lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise, showing that you are serious about buying the product but still aiming for a good price. 
* **Not too aggressive:** It's a smaller jump from your previous offer, suggesting you're willing to be reasonable.
* **Appeals to efficiency:**  Mentioning a quick close might sway Alice if she's eager to sell the product. 

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a calculated step toward finding a mutually agreeable price.  It allows for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but not close enough.**  $9,200 is still outside your ideal price range, and you're determined to save as much as possible.
* **You have a strong fallback:**  John's offer of $12,000 provides significant leverage.
* **Room for further negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you haven't exhausted all options yet.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating. You can try a slightly higher counteroffer, keeping in mind your maximum price and Alice's potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:**  This counteroffer is just slightly higher than your previous one, showing a genuine willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlights a fair deal:**  Emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both parties can appeal to Alice's sense of reason and fairness.
* **Keeps pressure on:**  It's a step closer to Alice's offer, but not so close that you lose all negotiating power.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a calculated attempt to close the gap, while still keeping your maximum price in mind.  It's a delicate balance, but with careful negotiation, you can reach a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. I'm thinking we can meet in the middle at $9,050. That's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has come down further, $9,050 is still above your target price. You're aiming to save as much as possible.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Alice's offer suggests she's open to further discussion, and you're not at your maximum price yet.
* **John provides a safety net:**  The option to buy from John for $12,000 gives you a strong fallback position.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. You can either offer a price closer to your target or try to understand why Alice is reluctant to go lower and explore alternative solutions."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,050 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,950.  If we can agree on that, we can close this deal right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8950}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:**  This counteroffer is a small but significant increase from your previous offer, showing a genuine attempt to meet Alice halfway.
* **Emphasis on closing:**  Highlighting the potential for a quick close can be persuasive. 
* **Strategic pricing:**  $8,950 is a good compromise point, as it's closer to Alice's price but still within your acceptable range.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,050 again, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $9,050 is still outside of your target price, and you're not willing to pay more. 
* **No room for further negotiation:**  Alice has declared it her final offer, indicating that she won't budge. 
* **John's offer is a better option:**  With only one round left, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $12,000. This ensures you get the product while saving money compared to Alice's final offer. 

**Strategy:**  While you were close to a deal with Alice, it's important to prioritize saving money. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids risking a stalemate in the final round."
