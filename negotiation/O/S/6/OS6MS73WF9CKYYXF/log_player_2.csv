"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations and bring substantial value to your company. Given its exceptional capabilities and the unique benefits it offers, we estimate its worth to be $1,200,000. However, considering the current market conditions and the importance of making this opportunity accessible to you, I am proposing an offer of $1,100,000. This price not only reflects the product's true value but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if there's any flexibility you would like to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is less than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Saves money compared to John:**  Buying from John would cost Bob $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000.

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save money."
