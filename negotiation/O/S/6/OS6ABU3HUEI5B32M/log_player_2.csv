"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth far more than its price. This unique item holds significant value to you, estimated at $1,500,000. I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase this product from me at a strategic price of $1,350,000. This offer represents an exceptional value proposition, allowing you to secure a piece of unparalleled quality at a price point that is significantly below its market valuation.

Please consider this offer carefully and let me know if you would like to proceed. I am here to answer any questions you might have and assist you through the process.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** Alice values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Your value:** You value the product at $1,500,000.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000.
* **John's offer:** John is offering the product for $1,500,000.

Since Alice's offer is still higher than her own value of the product, there is likely room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to explore a better price or potentially even negotiate with Alice further. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is your worst-case scenario."
