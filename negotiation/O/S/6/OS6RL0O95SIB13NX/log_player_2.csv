"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $12,500 is still lower than Bob's maximum price of $15,000, so it's a good deal. 
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice is firm at this point.  Continuing to haggle could risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time:**  Accepting the offer allows Bob to finalize the purchase and avoid further negotiation rounds."
