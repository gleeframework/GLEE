Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95?  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'll see if I can negotiate closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the same as what I could get from John.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
