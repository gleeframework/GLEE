"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95?  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That way we both get a fair deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
