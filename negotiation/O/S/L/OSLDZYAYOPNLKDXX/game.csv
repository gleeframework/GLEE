"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I believe the product has value, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
