Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for you.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before moving on to John.

**Strategic Offering**

You want to find a price that maximizes your profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept.  Here's a possible strategy:

1. **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's maximum valuation increases your chance of securing a higher profit. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if your initial offer is accepted, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate down. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin ($350,000 over your minimum) while still being $150,000 below Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the potential return on investment adds weight to the offer's fairness.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiating style."
