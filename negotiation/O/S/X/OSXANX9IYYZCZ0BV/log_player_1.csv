"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes my potential earnings.  I'm aiming to close the deal quickly but also leaving room to potentially move to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping the price by $100,000, signaling my willingness to negotiate but still staying above Bob's initial counteroffer. This keeps the pressure on him to move closer to my desired price while demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still push for a bit more. I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob without having to resort to selling to John. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making another slight adjustment to my price, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a higher price. I'm trying to find that sweet spot where we can both agree on a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting very close to my desired price.  While I could potentially squeeze out another $20,000, I'm concerned about the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer. With only four rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and brings me very close to my ideal price."
