Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** My ideal price is $1,500,000, but I know Bob's value is $800,000.
* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,400,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not offering the full $1,500,000 to leave space for Bob to counter and still feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Bob's Value:** I know Bob's value, so I won't go lower than $800,000.
* **My Floor:** If I can't get a better price than $1,500,000 from Bob, I'll sell to John.
* **Time is Money:**  I want to close the deal quickly, so I'm not going to waste time with a long negotiation if Bob isn't willing to come close to my starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While it's closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, which means I can be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob without risking a loss. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob.  I need to carefully consider the balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a quick deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My last offer was $1,400,000, and Bob countered with $850,000. I'm meeting him halfway with a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I want to move the negotiation forward and see if Bob is willing to meet me closer to my desired price. 

**Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 is still well above Bob's estimated value of $800,000, giving him incentive to agree.
* **Next Steps:** Depending on Bob's response, I will either accept his counteroffer if it's close enough to my desired price, or I will make another counteroffer to further bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Persistence:** Bob has consistently offered significantly lower prices.  While his latest offer is slightly higher than before, it's still too far from my desired profit margin.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is time-consuming, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a much better price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is more than double Bob's best offer.

**Conclusion:**  The opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. Selling to John ensures a quick and lucrative deal, which is the best option at this point."
