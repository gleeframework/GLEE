"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1400000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1400000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a price of $1200000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
