"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I'm confident will benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still providing you a good deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,125,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000 even? That would make it a much easier decision for me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
