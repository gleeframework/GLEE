"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is above her own valuation, it falls well below your maximum price of $1,200,000 and is cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while saving $50,000."
