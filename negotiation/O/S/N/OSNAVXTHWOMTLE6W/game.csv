"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. Would you consider $100?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you consider $110 for the product?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $105?  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",107.5,Alice,5,
