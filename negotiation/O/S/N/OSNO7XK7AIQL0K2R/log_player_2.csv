# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** We're offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that could be considered reasonable for both parties.
* **Focus on value:** We're emphasizing the value to *us* while also highlighting the potential profit for Alice. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial counter-offer leaves space for further negotiation, but it establishes a clear starting point for a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, reflecting the value of the product to you.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can close this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** We acknowledge Alice's concession while remaining firm on our need for a lower price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1300000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a good compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and gives me a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to our target price, but we can likely still negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, we can continue the negotiation and try to achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,325,000, which I believe is a fair and final offer.  This price allows us both to benefit from the deal, and I'm confident it's a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement now."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** We're acknowledging Alice's concession while remaining firm on our desire for a lower price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1325000 is still not a viable price for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, which is closer to your final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin.  Let's see if we can close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations aren't progressing significantly. Alice is unwilling to go below $1,400,000, which is still above our target price.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's  in our best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John for $1,000,000. This ensures we get the product at a price we're comfortable with and saves us further time and effort in negotiations."
