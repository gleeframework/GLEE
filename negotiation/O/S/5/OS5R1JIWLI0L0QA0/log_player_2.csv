You can likely get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a significant discount, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer is aggressive, but hopefully it will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Alice has come down in price, and $725,000 is a good deal.  There's always the risk she'll come down further, but it's not worth risking losing the deal for another $25,000."
