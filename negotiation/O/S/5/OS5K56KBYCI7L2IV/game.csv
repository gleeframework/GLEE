"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $14,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  I'll accept $15,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
