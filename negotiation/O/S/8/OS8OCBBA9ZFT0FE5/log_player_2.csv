Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $13,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

$11,000 is still too high. I'll try another counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000. I'm still willing to work with you, but I need a price that makes sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
