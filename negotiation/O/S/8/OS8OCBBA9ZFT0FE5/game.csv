"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $13,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000. I'm still willing to work with you, but I need a price that makes sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
