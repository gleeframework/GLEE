"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $1,100,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
