"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming to get the product for $8,000, and Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This is a reasonable counteroffer. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not at the point where it's a good deal for you. You're still aiming for $8,000, and you have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This is a strong counteroffer, showing your commitment to getting a good deal. You're very close to your target price, and it's likely Alice will have to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's tempting to accept Alice's offer, but remember, you're aiming for $8,000. You've already shown your willingness to negotiate, and you have more rounds to potentially get a better price. You're also close to your target price with John, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

You're close to your goal, but it's worth trying to get a little closer.  Alice is showing a willingness to come down in price, so a counteroffer at $9,000 could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, you're still just $250 away from getting the product from John. Keep pushing for a lower price, you're in a good position to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

You're very close to your target price, and it's worth trying one more time to push Alice lower.  You've already shown your willingness to negotiate, and she's clearly willing to meet you halfway.  A counteroffer at $9,000 might just be enough to close the deal."
