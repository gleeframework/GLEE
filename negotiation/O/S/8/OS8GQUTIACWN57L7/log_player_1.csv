"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and get some money, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a good price, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and agree to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also shows I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my ideal price. This may be the last chance for Bob to meet me in the middle before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still not enough for me. I'm determined to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm confident that we can reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $9,250.  It's a small concession, but I believe it shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. Hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a fair price. This is the last counter-offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's close to my minimum, I've already made a lot of concessions and I don't want to risk going another round. I've reached my limit and I'm not confident I can get a better price with Bob.  I'm better off selling to John and securing the guaranteed $12,000."
