"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is below my minimum price of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105? Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $95 is still below my minimum price of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  It's better to keep trying with Bob than to sell to John at this point, as I could potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John for $100. Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $100, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John than to risk continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
