# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,200?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive tone** to encourage further negotiation.
* **Show interest in the product** to signal that I'm serious about buying.
* **Offer a price significantly lower than Alice's asking price** but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $10,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

While Alice is moving closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming for $12,000 or less, and her current offer is still above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe."",

}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise:** Showing appreciation for her movement helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Propose a price closer to the middle ground:**  This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my maximum budget.
* **Present the offer as mutually beneficial:**  Framing the price as fair for both parties might make it more appealing to Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can do $10,600, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. Accepting this offer gets you the product at a price significantly below your maximum budget and further haggling might irritate her."
