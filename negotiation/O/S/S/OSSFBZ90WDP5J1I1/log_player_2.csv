"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. I've seen similar products online for around that price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Lowball:**  Bob starts by offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the tone for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his offer, referencing similar products online. This makes his counteroffer seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While offering a lower price, Bob's message maintains a friendly tone and shows he's open to discussing further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $110. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice has offered a price that's halfway between Bob's initial counteroffer and her original price. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Value Limit:**  Bob's maximum value for the product is $120. Accepting $110 is still a good deal for him, saving him $10.
* **Limited Rounds:** While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer is a reasonable choice considering the limited number of rounds and the potential for the price to increase later."
