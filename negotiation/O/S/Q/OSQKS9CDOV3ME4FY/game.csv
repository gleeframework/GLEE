"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
