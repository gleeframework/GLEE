Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting near the top of the ZOPA to maximize your potential profit.
* **Confident Language:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair offer"" emphasizes the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""initially proposing"" and ""let me know your thoughts,"" you signal willingness to discuss the price further, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Bob might accept, reject, or counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate further based on his response."
