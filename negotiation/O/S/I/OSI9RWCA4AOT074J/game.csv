"Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is closer, but I still need to make a fair profit.  How about we settle on $9,250?  It's a small step closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
