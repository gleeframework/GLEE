Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, the negotiation is likely to continue, and there is no guarantee Bob will be able to get the price down to his target. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at John's fixed price, ensuring he gets the best possible deal and avoids further negotiation."
