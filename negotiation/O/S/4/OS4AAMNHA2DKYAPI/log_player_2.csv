"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, there's potential to get an even better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, so offering $10,000 is a significant discount and a good starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer is bold but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is better than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to his initial offer of $10,000. This counteroffer of $11,000 shows Bob is willing to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is now closer to Bob's counteroffer of $11,000.  It's a good compromise, and accepting it would save Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $15,000 is too high. Accepting the offer is the best choice at this point."
