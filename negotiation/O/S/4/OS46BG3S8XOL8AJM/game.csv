"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting at a price that reflects the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I agree this product has potential, but $950,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a purchase price of $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the price. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To be frank, I'm only comfortable going as high as $760,000. I need to be mindful of my spending, and that's my final offer.  Let me know if we have a deal.",760000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $760,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the price. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $765,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",765000.0,Alice,7,
