``` 

This offer is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  By starting high, I can try to maximize my profits.  If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and see how low he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $100 for the product at this time. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for it.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet the price of $125. I would like to propose $110 as my maximum offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and try to get closer to my desired price."
