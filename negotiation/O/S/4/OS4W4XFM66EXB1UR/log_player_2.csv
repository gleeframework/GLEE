"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is offering it for that price. You can get it from John for the same price. There is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting it means you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice later or buy from John."
