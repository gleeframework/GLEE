"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,250 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Potential Savings:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or a lengthy negotiation process increases. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase at a price lower than John's."
