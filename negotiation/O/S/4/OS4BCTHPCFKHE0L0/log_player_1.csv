Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** It's friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also acknowledges Bob's perspective, which can make him more receptive.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and maintaining a negotiation that could lead to a successful sale.  By starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, there's room to negotiate downwards if necessary. However, it's also important to consider the potential of selling to John for $12,000 as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a significant loss.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point, hoping to find a compromise. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob, taking into account his budget and my own minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $9,500 is a compromise that is significantly closer to my minimum desired value of $12,000 while still being lower than my initial offer. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product. It also shows that I am willing to negotiate but have a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's budget. It is important to maintain a firm stance while also showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  By presenting a reasonable offer with a clear justification, I hope to persuade Bob to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $9,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is still below my desired $12,000, it's getting very close.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit of $1,000, which is better than nothing.  

**Strategy:**

This decision balances the following factors:

* **Profit:** A $9,000 sale gives me a $1,000 profit, which is better than selling to John for $12,000 and incurring the cost of selling to John (opportunity cost).
* **Time:** Continuing negotiations could be time-consuming and might not lead to a higher offer from Bob.
* **Risk:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with no sale.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the above factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most rational decision at this point."
