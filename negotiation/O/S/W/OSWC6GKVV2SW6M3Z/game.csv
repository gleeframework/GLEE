"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $120. Is this something you'd like to consider?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $100. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you mentioned.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about $105? I think it's a fair price that balances both our interests.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a smaller offer, $98. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and it's still a bit lower than your last offer.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $102, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a small adjustment to my previous offer and propose $99. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $105, Bob. I think we've compromised enough already. I'm willing to meet you at $100.50, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",100.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $98, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John.",98.0,Bob,10,
