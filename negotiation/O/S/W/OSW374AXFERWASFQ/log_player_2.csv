"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality and value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer is way above your budget and even its value to her. It makes much more sense to go with your backup plan.
