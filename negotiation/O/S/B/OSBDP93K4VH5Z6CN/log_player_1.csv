"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $100 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're discussing this further. I'm still working within my budget constraints. Would $90 be possible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his $90 offer. It seems unlikely he'll go much higher. Since I have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John, it makes more sense to take the sure profit rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
