"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, my original price was carefully considered based on the potential this product has. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a deal that benefits us both.  To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a great value for you.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me at $1,200,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so I'm thinking $1,150,000 is a fair price. I believe it's a good compromise that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
