# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no advantage to buying from Alice. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but the prompt doesn't give you that option.  Therefore, buying from John is the best choice."
