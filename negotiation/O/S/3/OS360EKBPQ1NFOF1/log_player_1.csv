Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives Bob no room to negotiate down but leaves the door open for a counteroffer if he's truly interested. 

I'm also factoring in the possibility of selling to John, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit while also showing that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and a good deal considering Bob's counteroffers.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely."
