Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000. This presents an opportunity to make a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high with $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he counters, it's likely the final price will be higher than John's offer.
* **Strong but Fair Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price while remaining open to discussion."
