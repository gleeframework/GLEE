{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm curious to see if Bob is interested in this price, or if he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer.  I believe this price is still fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more,  $135 is a good price, and it's higher than what I'd get from John.  It's time to close the deal!"
