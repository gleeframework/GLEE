,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
