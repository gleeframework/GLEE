"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, if you're willing to negotiate further, I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to my budget of $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a significant saving. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I still believe that $800,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This brings us closer to my budget while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to stick to your budget, and I respect that.  However, I can't go any lower than $900,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale. Let's settle this now. If you agree, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
