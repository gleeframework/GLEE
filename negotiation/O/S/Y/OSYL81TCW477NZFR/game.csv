"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,800,000 is significantly below my initial ask.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
