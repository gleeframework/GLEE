"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.**  You're aiming to spend no more than $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is at $1,300,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's good to have a backup, but it's not the most ideal scenario.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  You're starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price considerably lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer still gives Alice room to compromise without going below her minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:** We'll see how Alice responds to this counteroffer. If she rejects it, we'll need to continue negotiating."

Round 3

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $1,500,000.
* **There's still potential for a better deal.** By rejecting her offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to your goal.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but not ideal.** You're still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between your desired price and Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's previous offer ($1,400,000) and your last counteroffer ($1,000,000). 
* **Getting closer to your goal:** This price is still within your budget and significantly lower than what Alice initially wanted.
* **Showing commitment:**  This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:** We'll see if Alice is willing to accept this compromise. If she rejects, we'll need to continue negotiating to find a mutually agreeable price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above your target price of $1,500,000.
* **You're nearing your limit.** You've already made a few counteroffers, and the time is getting limited.  
* **You can still try to negotiate a better price.** There's still room to find a middle ground, but you need to be more aggressive.

**Next Steps:** You need to make a strong counteroffer in the next round.  Consider pushing for a price closer to your goal, but be mindful of not alienating Alice."

* **Showing your limit:** This indicates that you're willing to pay a bit more but are nearing your maximum budget.

* **Limited time:** You only have a few rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will budge further. 
* **John's offer is a safe alternative.**  You're guaranteed to get the product at your maximum price, even though it's not the ideal outcome.

**Next Steps:** You've reached the point where it's better to accept a guaranteed deal rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
