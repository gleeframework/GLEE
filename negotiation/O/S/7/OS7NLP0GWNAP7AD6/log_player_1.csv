"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I need to sell the product for at least $12,000, I'm not willing to immediately accept such a low price.  I'll counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm offering $12,500, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to be flexible. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm hopeful that Bob will see my determination and adjust his offer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, my minimum price.  I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair price given his own valuation of the product.  At this point, it's a lose-lose for him to reject the offer, as he'll have to pay the same amount to John if he wants the product."
