"Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering I can buy the product from John for $12,000.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into our negotiation.",13500.0,Alice,5,
