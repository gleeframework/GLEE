"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it while also giving you a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I have in the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions, and it's the highest I'm able to go at this point.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000, which is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
