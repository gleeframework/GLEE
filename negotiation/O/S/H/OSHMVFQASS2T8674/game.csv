"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise on my end. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $10,250 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,7,
