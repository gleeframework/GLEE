Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I think it would be incredibly valuable to your work, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but since Bob values the product less, we need to leave him some room for profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong starting point. It gives Bob a potential profit of $1,500, which is a significant incentive to buy. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice leverage. It allows her to confidently price higher than Bob's perceived value.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer.  However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit."
