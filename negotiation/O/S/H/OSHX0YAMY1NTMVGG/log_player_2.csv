"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to his ideal price while still being attractive to Alice. A $9,000 offer is a significant discount from the initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer signals Bob's willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a good price for Bob.  While he might be able to get it down a bit more, there's a risk of losing the deal. 

* **Risk of rejection:** If Bob rejects the offer and makes another counteroffer, Alice might reject it.  
* **Time pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, there's a chance Bob won't be able to reach a lower price. 

Accepting this offer gives Bob a solid deal and saves him $2,500 compared to buying from John."
