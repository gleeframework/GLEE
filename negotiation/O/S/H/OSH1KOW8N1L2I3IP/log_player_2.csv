"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential for your business.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects its value and allows for a good margin for you. Let's chat about it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,400,000 vs. $1,000,000).  This means there is room for negotiation.  It's also less than the price John is offering ($1,500,000).  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to save money before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's start with $1,200,000.  This would still give you a solid profit and leave room for us both to benefit."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly unique, and I believe its value to you justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? This price gives us both a good deal and allows for a successful partnership.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, and the price is now within Bob's budget.  At $1,350,000, Bob is saving $150,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the best choice at this point."
