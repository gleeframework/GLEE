{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential for your business.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects its value and allows for a good margin for you. Let's chat about it further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to give me a good profit, but still leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price closer to Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's start with $1,200,000.  This would still give you a solid profit and leave room for us both to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I will counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly unique, and I believe its value to you justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? This price gives us both a good deal and allows for a successful partnership. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
