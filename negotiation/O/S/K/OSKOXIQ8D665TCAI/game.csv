"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I believe in the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
