Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,300,000.  While she might come down slightly in future rounds, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her sticking to her price. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000, which is a better deal for Bob at this point."
