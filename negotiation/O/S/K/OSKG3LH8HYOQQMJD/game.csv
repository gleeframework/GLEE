"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $7,000 is still quite low for what I can offer.  Perhaps we could settle on $9,000? This would allow me to make a fair deal while still acknowledging your budget.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand the value you see in the product, but I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to meet at $7,500? That's the highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about $8,500? This is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,7,
