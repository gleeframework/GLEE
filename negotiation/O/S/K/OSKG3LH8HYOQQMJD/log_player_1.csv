"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $7,000 is still quite low for what I can offer.  Perhaps we could settle on $9,000? This would allow me to make a fair deal while still acknowledging your budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand the value you see in the product, but I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to meet at $7,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, but it's still significantly less than what John is offering. We're getting closer to a point where accepting Bob's offer might be worthwhile, but it's still too early to concede. We need to show Bob we're firm but willing to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about $8,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8500} 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting into the later rounds, and it's time to start putting a bit of pressure on Bob. This offer is still above his initial offer and a decent compromise. By stating it's our final offer, we signal we're serious and might walk away, prompting him to make a more substantial move if he's genuinely interested."
