"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $250 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $220. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget concerns.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I can do $200, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the value of the product. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good price. How about we meet at $210? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",210.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I can do $205, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",205.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $210 and $205. How about we try $207.50? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",207.5,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $207.50 and $202.50. How about we try $205? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",205.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really not willing to go any higher than $202.50. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. I'm also considering buying the product from John for $150, so I'd like to get a final offer from you.",202.5,Bob,10,
