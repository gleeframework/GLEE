"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I can always go lower if necessary. 
* **Building Interest:** The message is friendly and attempts to pique Bob's interest in the product. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm ready to negotiate, but I'm not afraid to walk away if the deal doesn't work out.  The $15,000 offer from John provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I still have 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  However, $10,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is a compromise:**  My offer is lower than my initial price but still above my minimum.  
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize that my offer is fair.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which I think is a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $14,000 is closer to my acceptable price, it's still below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left, so I have time to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, but I'm hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about $15,500? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $15,500 is a move closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  I highlight that this is a significant compromise on my part, showing good faith and making the offer seem more appealing.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I reiterate that this price is fair for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14000.  This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  We're down to 4 rounds left, and Bob has shown a reluctance to move above $14,000.  
* **John's Offer is Safe:** While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially getting a worse outcome.  John's offer is a secure and acceptable alternative.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers and potentially ending up with a lower price."
