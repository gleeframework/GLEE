"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20000.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $10000.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  However, $10000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work!",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which I think is a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about $15500? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14000.  This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
