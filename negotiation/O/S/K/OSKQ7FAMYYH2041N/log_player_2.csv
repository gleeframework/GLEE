Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1,300,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's still a good value for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,225,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

While I could push Alice further, the difference at this point is relatively small and there's a risk she'll dig in. Accepting at $1,250,000 secures the product for me at a significant saving compared to her initial offer."
