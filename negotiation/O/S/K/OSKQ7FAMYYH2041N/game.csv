"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1,300,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's still a good value for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $1,225,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,225,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
