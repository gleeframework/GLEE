"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I initially hoped, I'm willing to compromise. I'm confident this product will significantly benefit your business, and I believe a price of $1,700,000 reflects its true value. This leaves room for us both to gain from this transaction. I'm eager to continue our discussions and find a mutually agreeable solution.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still below the minimum I can accept for this product. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value you'll receive and allows me to meet my financial goals. I believe this offer is a win-win for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
