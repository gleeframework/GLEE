"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe it's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I think I can do better than that. I'll offer $10,750 again, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $100 credit towards the purchase if you're willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,
