"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider $975,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1,000,000.  If you're serious about this, let's meet in the middle at $987,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",987500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target of $800,000. Can you consider $925,000? It's a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,6,
