Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), I want to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a price of $12,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It also conveys that I believe the product has value beyond the base $10,000.
* **Open Communication:** By mentioning that I'm offering it to Bob before a wider release, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially encouraging a quicker decision."
