"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I do find the product interesting, the price point you've presented is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $500,000.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  To be honest, $600,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $650,000. I think this is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Alice,5,
