"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  I'm starting with an offer slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation but signals I'm serious about buying at a fair price.
* **Polite and Conversational:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. It's a great product, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still significantly above her perceived value. While she came down slightly, it's worth another counteroffer to try and meet closer to the middle ground between our positions.  We're still well below our ""buy from John"" price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a great product, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** This offer is closer to the midpoint between my previous offer and her current one, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Clear and Firm:** By stating it ""feels like a fair compromise,"" I'm subtly implying this might be my final offer before considering John's deal.
* **Maintaining Positivity:** The tone remains friendly and solution-oriented, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
