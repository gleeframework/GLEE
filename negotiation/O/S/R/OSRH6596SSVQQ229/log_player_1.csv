{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price of $10,000 is also below Bob's estimated value of $12,000, meaning there's a range where we can potentially reach an agreement.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Price:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can potentially secure a higher price. He recognizes the value of the product and is willing to pay more than my fallback option with John. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can push for a better deal. I'll likely counter with a price closer to my initial $10,000, which is still below his perceived value. 
* **Avoiding a Quick Settlement:** Accepting Bob's offer too quickly might signal that I'm desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. It's a great product, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $9,500  is a compromise,  meeting halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not giving in too easily.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value, reinforcing my belief that $9,500 is a fair price.
* **Maintaining Optimism:**  I end with a positive tone, expressing hope for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a great product, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price point of $9,500.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob withdrawing his offer altogether or lowering his price even further.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Accepting his offer guarantees a profit that is significantly higher than selling to John for $8,000."
