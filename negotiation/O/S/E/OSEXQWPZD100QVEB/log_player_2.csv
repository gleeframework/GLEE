"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would significantly enhance the value of your business. Considering its worth to you, I propose an initial offer of $1,250,000. This price reflects not only the product's intrinsic value but also the potential benefits it could bring to your operations. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,250,000 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our discussion, I am pleased to counteroffer at $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our respective positions and aims to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and allows us to move forward towards a successful agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,150,000, which is a good compromise. While Bob could potentially push for a lower price, it's worth considering that:

* **He's already saved $100,000** from the initial offer.
* **More rounds might lead to further negotiations, but also risk Alice walking away.**
* **Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be a significantly worse deal.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is a smart move for Bob. It secures a good price and avoids potential risks of further negotiations or having to buy from John."
