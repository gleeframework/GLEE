{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've lowered my price considerably and am very close to my minimum. However, with only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and risk ending up with a price I'm not comfortable with.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum and don't risk losing out on a better deal."
