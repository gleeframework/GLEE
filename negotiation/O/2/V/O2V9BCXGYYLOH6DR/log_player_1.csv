Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $120 guaranteed, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it just below my guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and a feeling of a ""good deal"" for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very keen, potentially earning me even more."
