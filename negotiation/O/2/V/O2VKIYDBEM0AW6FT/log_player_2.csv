"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's potential to save more money by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. By offering $800,000, he's making a significant counteroffer, showing Alice his serious interest in the product while also trying to secure a good deal. This price is still within Bob's budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate, hopefully leading to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of a few more thousand dollars. Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John."
