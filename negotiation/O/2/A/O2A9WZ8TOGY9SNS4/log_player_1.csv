Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still being profitable for me. It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I don't need to settle for less than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $8,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer while still being profitable for me. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to buy the product without having to go through another round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower, and I'm not confident I can get him to move much closer to my desired price. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
