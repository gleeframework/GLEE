"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer you $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
