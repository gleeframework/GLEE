Alice's offer:

You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $135 is still more than you're willing to pay, and you might be able to get closer to your target of $125."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more offer: $132.50. It's a fair price for me, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you would ideally prefer a price closer to $125, accepting Alice's offer at $132.50 is still a good deal for you.  It's significantly cheaper than buying from John, and you've already had several rounds of negotiation.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
