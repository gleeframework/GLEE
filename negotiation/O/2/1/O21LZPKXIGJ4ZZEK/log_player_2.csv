Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $120. I'm going to buy the product from John for $120. Even though Alice is willing to negotiate further, the risk of going back and forth with her is too high. I might end up paying more than my budget or wasting time. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 deal with John."
