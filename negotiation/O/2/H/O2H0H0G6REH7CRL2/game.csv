"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between these figures? I believe $10500 could be a mutually beneficial compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that.  $10500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10750? This is a good deal for both of us, and allows us to move forward. Let me know your thoughts.",10750.0,Alice,5,
