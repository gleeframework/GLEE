Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. 
* This is a price higher than my guaranteed minimum of $8,000 from John, so I'm aiming to maximize my profit.
* Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm using a relatively high price.  This will allow me to secure a good profit if Bob values the product highly enough, but it also leaves room to potentially negotiate if Bob is hesitant."
