Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,750 is a bit too high for me. How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Bob is clearly not willing to meet near my desired price. It's not worth my time to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $8,000 from John."
