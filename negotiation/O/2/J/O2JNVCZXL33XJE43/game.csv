"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. This price still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,
