"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher or at least get closer to my target before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it still reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000 and it's  a good deal for me considering I'm just one round away from selling to John for $8,000. It's  better to secure the deal now rather than risk another round of negotiation."
