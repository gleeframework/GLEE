{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, briefly highlighting the product's value might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Time Limit (Optional):**  Adding a time limit can sometimes encourage a quicker decision from Bob.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $80, he doesn't know your valuation. This information asymmetry is where you can potentially gain an advantage.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering a price too high might lead Bob to reject it outright. However, a lower price leaves potential profit on the table. It's a balancing act."
