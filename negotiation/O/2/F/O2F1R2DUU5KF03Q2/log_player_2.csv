"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $200 might be a little high for your budget, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's really a great product and well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While it's a nice product, $175 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't let this go for less than $150. That's my bottom line.  It's a steal at that price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her bottom line of $150. This is still more than your maximum budget of $100.  There's little chance of getting her lower, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $100."
