# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
