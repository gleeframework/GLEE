"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a tempting offer, it's still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I'm confident this price will still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12800.0,Bob,4,
