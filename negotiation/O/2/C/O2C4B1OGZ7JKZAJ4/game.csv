"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. Can you meet me at $130? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $135? It's a bit lower than my initial ask, but I think it's a sweet spot for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about $132? It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $132. How about $128.50? Can you meet me at that price?",128.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I like the fact that you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm willing to accept your offer of $128.50, but I'd like to throw in an additional benefit to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free accessory with the product? Would that change your mind and make you willing to meet me at $129?",129.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $129. I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as low as I can go. Can you accept that price?",128.0,Bob,10,
