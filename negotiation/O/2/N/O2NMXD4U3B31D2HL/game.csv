"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $12000 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12750?  This would be a good deal for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction.",12750.0,Bob,4,
