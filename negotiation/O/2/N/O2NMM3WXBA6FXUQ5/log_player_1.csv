Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below what I would get from John. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't accept it, but I will counteroffer to try and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $125, which is still higher than what Bob offered, but closer to what I know the product is worth to him. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
