"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I'm interested but $12000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we start at $10000? Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11000. How about we split the difference and go with $10500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think we could finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",10800.0,Alice,5,
