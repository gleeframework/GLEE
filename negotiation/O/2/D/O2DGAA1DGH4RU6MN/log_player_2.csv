"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a steal! I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of $12,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round.  I have plenty of rounds left and can potentially get a better deal."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $11,025 is still above my target. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can reach a final agreement. I still have 5 rounds left and don't want to rush into a deal that isn't in my best interest."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this deal work, but $10,950 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, which I believe is a fair compromise given our previous offers. Let's wrap this up and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10900}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can tell you're eager to finalize the deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to account for the value I'm bringing to the table.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last round.  Alice's offer of $11,050 is still above my target price.  I'm not willing to go that high, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in this final round.  It's better to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid risking a deal falling apart."
