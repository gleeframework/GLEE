"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a steal! I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the deal you're offering, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to go as high as $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're comfortable with.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $11,025. It's a slight increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11025.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,025 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,875. That's a fair compromise that meets us both halfway.  Let's make a deal!",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,875, but I'd like to propose a small concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,950. It's a slight increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this deal work, but $10,950 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, which I believe is a fair compromise given our previous offers. Let's wrap this up and finalize the deal.",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can tell you're eager to finalize the deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to account for the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $11,050. It's a small premium, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11050.0,Alice,9,
