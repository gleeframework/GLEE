Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,150,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. How about $1,175,000? This keeps us close to the middle ground and reflects the value this product will bring you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,175,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1,100,000 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems stuck on $1,100,000. It's time to push back firmly and signal I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't budge significantly. This might make him reconsider his position.  We still have a few rounds to negotiate and John's offer is a safety net."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, but I need to be upfront.  I can't accept anything less than $1,160,000 for this product. It's a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward at this price."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but $1,160,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his $1,100,000 offer.  He's now trying to anchor the negotiation around that number by suggesting compromises based on it.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome than John's $800,000 offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed deal."
