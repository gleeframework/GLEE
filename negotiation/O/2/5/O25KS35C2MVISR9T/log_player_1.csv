Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,000?  That's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal I can get.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still a little hesitant at $13,500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  How about we settle on $14,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I have a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I value your willingness to negotiate,  $13,750 isn't quite hitting my target. Would you consider $14,000?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will offer a price that meets my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
