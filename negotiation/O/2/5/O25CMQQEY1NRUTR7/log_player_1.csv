Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get closer to my desired price. Additionally, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach an acceptable agreement with Bob."
