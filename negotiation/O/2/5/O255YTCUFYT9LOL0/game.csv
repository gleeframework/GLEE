"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
