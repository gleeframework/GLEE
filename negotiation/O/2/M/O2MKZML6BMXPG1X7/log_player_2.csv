"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really useful. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  You know you can get it from John for $150, so aim to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $135?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price. At $135, you're saving $15 compared to buying from John.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance that Alice will dig in and you'll end up back at $140. It's better to secure the lower price now."
