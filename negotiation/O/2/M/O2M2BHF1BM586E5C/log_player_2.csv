"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely do better. You know the product is only worth $80 to Alice, giving you room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $110? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my desired value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still a good deal for you considering your maximum budget of $150.  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer at $110 ensures you get the product at a lower price than John and within your budget."
