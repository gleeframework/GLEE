Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my absolute minimum, as it's still better for me than selling to John. Bob is aware of my minimum, so he knows any counteroffer below that won't be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum and I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, still below my minimum, but closer to what I'm hoping to achieve. I believe there's room to negotiate, and I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about finding a deal with Bob."
