Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $115, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the ""deal"" aspect, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, as indicated by the message, which makes Bob feel like he has some leverage.

**Strategy:** 

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I can counter with a slightly lower price, keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown interest, and there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my leverage and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not by a large amount.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $110 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my target price. 
* **Re-emphasizing Deal:**  I'm reiterating the ""good deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good value.

**Strategy:** 

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good result. 
* If Bob rejects, I can consider lowering my price slightly again, but I'll be mindful of my minimum acceptable price of $120."
