"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $60 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $105 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  How about $95? That's my final offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $95 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I can do $80,  but that's my absolute limit.",80.0,Bob,6,
