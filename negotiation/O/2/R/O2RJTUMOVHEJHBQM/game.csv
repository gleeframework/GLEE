"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to pay $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still need to stay within my budget. I propose we meet halfway between our prices, at $900,000. This would allow us to reach a compromise that respects both our financial positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
