"Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe will be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price, considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet.  I'm willing to come down to $12000 for this product. It's still a great deal, and I believe it's worth the value it brings. Let's find a compromise we both agree on.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $9500 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $11000. That's a fair price for a product like this, and it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
