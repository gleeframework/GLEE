"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unknown Value:**  You have no information about the product's actual worth.  Alice's offer is the starting point, but you don't know if it's fair or inflated.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** You have a better chance of getting a better price by rejecting the initial offer and starting negotiations. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. You can use this as a reference point during your negotiations with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, you can start negotiating with Alice and potentially find a price that's lower than $1,000,000, saving you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value, I'm not comfortable with the starting price. I'm willing to consider purchasing at $750,000.  This reflects my initial assessment of the product's worth and leaves room for us to find common ground. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire for a better deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $750,000 leaves space for further negotiation. You can potentially go higher if needed, but starting low allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting your assessment of the product's value. 

This counteroffer aims to start negotiations with Alice and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $750000 is below my minimum threshold for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 to reflect your interest and facilitate a deal.  This leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal target of $750,000. You've shown your willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to budge. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open. You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price point.
* **John as Backup:** You have John as a backup, so you're not pressured to accept a price that's too high.  You can use this as leverage.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue the negotiations and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down. While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Instead of jumping back down to your initial $750,000, you're showing Alice you're willing to meet her halfway. This signals a genuine desire for a deal.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  You're providing a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting your interest and budget constraints. 
* **Room for Compromise:** The offer of $850,000 leaves room for Alice to come down a bit, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while keeping your goal of securing a price below $900,000."
