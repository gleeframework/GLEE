"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we compromise at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
