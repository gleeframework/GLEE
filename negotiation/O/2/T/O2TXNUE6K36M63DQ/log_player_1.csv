Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated you won't sell for less than $8,000, and $12,000 gives you a good profit margin.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he'll see this as a good deal as well.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price down slightly, but you still have plenty of room to make a profit."
