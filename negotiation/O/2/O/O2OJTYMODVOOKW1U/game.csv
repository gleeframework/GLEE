"Alice,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $800000 at this time. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business or personal life. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for closer to my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $850000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and lets us both walk away satisfied.",850000.0,Bob,6,
