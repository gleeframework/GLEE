"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $10,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This offer represents a significant reduction from your initial price, and it's the highest I can go at this point.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, which would be $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit stretched at $9,500. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to pay $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9,250 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm thinking of $9,750. This is a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
