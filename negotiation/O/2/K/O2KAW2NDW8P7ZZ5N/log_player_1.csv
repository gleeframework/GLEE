Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm asking $15,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is above my minimum value of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By mentioning I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  ""Unique"" and ""worth a lot to me"" subtly imply the product is valuable without revealing my exact valuation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response to determine my next move.
* **Counteroffers:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll carefully consider it and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but given my budget, I am only able to offer $12000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum value of $10,000 but still leaves room for a better deal. 
* **Seeking a Higher Price:**  I'm aiming to get as close to my initial $15,000 offer as possible.  Selling to John for $10,000 is my last resort.
* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial price and still attractive enough to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, potentially aiming for a price between $13,000 and $14,000. 
* **Bob's Response:** I'll assess Bob's reaction to my counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:**  I've lowered my price from $15,000 to $13,500, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.  This price is still above my minimum of $10,000 and potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I've re-emphasized the value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiations flowing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll await Bob's response to my counteroffer and make a decision based on his feedback.
* **Options:** I'm prepared to either accept his offer if it's reasonable, reject his offer and make a new counteroffer, or sell to John as a last resort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $13500. I would like to propose $13000 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $3,000 less than my initial asking price and is closer to my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, there's a good chance that further negotiation will be unproductive and could lead to a stalemate.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale above my minimum value and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether or selling to John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the Deal:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale. 
* **Potential Future Negotiations:** While this is a final decision for now, I'll keep in mind that Bob might be willing to negotiate on other terms or for future purchases."
