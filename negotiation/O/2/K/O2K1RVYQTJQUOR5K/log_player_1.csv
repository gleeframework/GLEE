{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking to get $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing Bob values the product at $100. This gives us room for negotiation, but still allows me to potentially make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I'm flexible on this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can we meet in the middle at $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $137.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $142.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think I'm wasting my time here, but I'll give it one more shot. I'll meet you at $140, that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll just have to go with John's offer of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that he'll walk away, leaving me with no sale. Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is more than Bob's final offer and meets my minimum requirement. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
