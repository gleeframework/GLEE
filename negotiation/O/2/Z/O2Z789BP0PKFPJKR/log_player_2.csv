You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have room to negotiate and potentially save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $10,500.  I believe this product would truly benefit you and it's a fair price for its value.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point of $12,000.  It's closer to your initial counteroffer, but it's still worth negotiating further to try and save more money.  You can make a slightly higher counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
