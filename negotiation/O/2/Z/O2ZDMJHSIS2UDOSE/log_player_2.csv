"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price from John ($15,000) than Alice's offer ($13,000).  It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $12,000.  Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some room to profit while still being a better deal for you than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,200 is only slightly better than her previous offer ($13,000), but it's still more than what you're willing to pay. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown you're willing to negotiate. This offer increases your previous offer by $250, demonstrating you're willing to compromise but still keeping it below your maximum price. Alice may be more inclined to accept as it gets her closer to her desired value while still providing you with a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,400 is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still higher than your last counteroffer.  While further negotiation might be possible, it's likely to be a long and tedious process. Since John offers a known and reliable price of $15,000, it's safer to purchase from John at this point and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
