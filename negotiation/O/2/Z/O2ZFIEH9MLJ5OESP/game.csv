"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still allowing you to make a significant profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still keeping me within my budget.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
