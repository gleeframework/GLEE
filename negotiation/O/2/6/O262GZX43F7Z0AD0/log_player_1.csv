Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  My message conveys a willingness to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup, ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $11,000. However, I am currently only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is still room to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I want to see if I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous positions.
* **Emphasize Win-Win:**  I highlight that this price is a ""good deal"" for both of us.
* **Urgency:**  I subtly suggest that closing quickly is beneficial to both parties. 

This approach aims to:

* **Increase the chances of Bob accepting:** By offering a compromise, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and make the deal work.
* **Stay Above my Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not losing out on value.
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  By suggesting a quick close, I'm trying to avoid drawn-out negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet you at $10,500. I would like to stick to my original offer of $10,000 if possible. Thank you for understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Compromise:** Bob has been steadfast on his $10,000 offer, and I've already moved closer to his position.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing John as a buyer. 
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This is the most secure option and ensures I don't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
