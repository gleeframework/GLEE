"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I can spend right now. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $92. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer if you're not comfortable with this offer.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92 is getting close to my minimum, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $97. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",97.0,Alice,7,
