Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, we can afford to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely highlights the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details that Bob could use against us.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and open to Bob's thoughts, encouraging him to counter-offer rather than just rejecting the initial price.

By aiming high and being prepared to negotiate, Alice maximizes her chances of getting a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable amount."
