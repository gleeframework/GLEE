"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $120, given its benefits to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm not sure I agree with Alice's valuation of the product. I think it's worth no more than $80 to me. Alice's offer of $120 is too high. I'll reject her offer.
