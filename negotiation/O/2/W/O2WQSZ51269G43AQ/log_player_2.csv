"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$75 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.**  You want to try and get a lower price. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you plenty of opportunity to bargain.
* **You have a safety net.** The option to buy from John for $100 provides you with a fallback if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** I'm offering $60, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $75. 
* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer is a way to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  There's still room to increase my offer if necessary, and I have 8 rounds left to do so."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, but still above my target price.**  While $70 is closer to my maximum, I'm still hoping for a lower price. 
* **I have 7 rounds left.** This gives me time to continue negotiating without rushing.
* **John's offer is still a viable option if I can't get a better price.**  I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $60 to $65, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget.
* **Midpoint:**  $65 is the midpoint between my last offer ($60) and Alice's latest offer ($70), signaling a desire to find a compromise.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and see if Alice is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price.**  $72 is within my budget and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer.
* **I'm running out of time.** With only 5 rounds left, I need to make a decision soon to avoid having to buy from John.
* **There's a risk of going higher.** If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, Alice might reject it, and I could end up paying more in the end.

**It's a calculated risk, but I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the potential for a higher price later.**"
