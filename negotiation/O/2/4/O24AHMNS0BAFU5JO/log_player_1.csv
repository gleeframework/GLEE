Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $800,000 minimum, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This makes it attractive to Bob, giving him a potential gain.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Keep in mind that this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for you. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Selling to John is a better option:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $800,000, which is higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he is interested. You can try to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price that is closer to your desired value.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $700,000 but lower than your initial offer of $950,000. This will show him you are willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($700,000). It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:** Emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome can encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and keeps us moving towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's closer to my desired price, it's not enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating with him.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $800,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and energy, potentially costing me more in the long run.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell the product for a higher price, selling to John is the most logical and financially advantageous decision at this point."
