Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will either accept or make a counteroffer that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $80, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether."
