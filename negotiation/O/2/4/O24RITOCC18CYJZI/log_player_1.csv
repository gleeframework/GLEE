"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price well above Bob's perceived value. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to explore if there's any wiggle room in his budget. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a lot closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to bridge the gap and secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000, still above Bob's offer but acknowledging his willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for a more favorable price. The offer from John still provides a better safety net, giving me the flexibility to negotiate more aggressively with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,400,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate.  This price is significantly closer to Bob's last offer, potentially making it more appealing while still giving me a respectable profit.  This is a strategic move to gauge Bob's seriousness in reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to secure a higher price,  Bob's consistent low offers are making it increasingly unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  John's offer guarantees me a significantly higher profit, and it's time to secure that sale.  The remaining rounds are simply not worth the risk of losing out on a guaranteed profit."
