"Round 1

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $900,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $750,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than her asking price but still above her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still hoping to get a better price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for a few more rounds. $850,000 is closer to my target price, but I'm going to try to push for something lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice $800,000.  This is her minimum acceptable price, so hopefully she'll accept and we can close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my target price and is a good deal for me considering John's offer of $1,200,000. It's also a decent price for Alice, given her minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's time to accept this offer and close the deal."
