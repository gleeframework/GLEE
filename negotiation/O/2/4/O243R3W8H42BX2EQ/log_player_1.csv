Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts. Based on my assessment and financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than his initial offer and exceeds my fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether."
