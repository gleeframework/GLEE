"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible.  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can make it work.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?  That's a good deal for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $115. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $122? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value",122.0,Alice,5,
