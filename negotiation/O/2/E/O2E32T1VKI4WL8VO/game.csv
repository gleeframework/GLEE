"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I could potentially go up to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a workable solution here. While $750,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
