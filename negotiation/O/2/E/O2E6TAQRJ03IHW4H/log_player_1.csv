Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.  
* **Alternative:** By setting the price high, you increase the chance of Bob rejecting the offer. However, you have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above $8,000.
* A more nuanced approach might involve gathering more information about Bob's needs and tailoring the offer and message accordingly."
