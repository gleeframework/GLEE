Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum value but allows for some negotiation space.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if I can adjust the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is still above my minimum value of $120, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$105 is still too low, but it is getting closer. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $115. This is still a fair price for me, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not sure Bob will go higher, and I don't want to risk continuing this negotiation. John is a guaranteed $120, which is more than what I'd get from Bob right now."
