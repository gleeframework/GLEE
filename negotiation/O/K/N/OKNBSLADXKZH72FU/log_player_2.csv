You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $10,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.

You have three options:

You're still closer to your target price of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both come down in our prices. Let's seal the deal.

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still above your target price of $8,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for your target price, it's a better decision to go with John and save the extra $1,000."
