,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you want to get a fair price, but $9,250 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both come down in our prices. Let's seal the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
