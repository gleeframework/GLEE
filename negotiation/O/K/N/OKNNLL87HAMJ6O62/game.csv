"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is a bit out of my price range at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
