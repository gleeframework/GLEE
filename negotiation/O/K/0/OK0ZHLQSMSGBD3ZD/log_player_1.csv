Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant profit margin while still allowing me to get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** The message highlights the potential profit margin for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, allowing me to adjust my price if needed. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup, ensuring I'll receive at least $1,500,000 for the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my next move based on his willingness to pay and my desire to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows that he's still interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I have room to push for a higher price.
* **Leveraging John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $1,500,000, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll use the fact that John is a potential buyer to strengthen my position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This still offers you a great opportunity to make a profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential profit he can make, which should motivate him to consider my offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, showing that I'm not desperate and have John as a backup. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully assess Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I will need to weigh my options:

* **Further Compromise:**  Consider reducing my price slightly further, but only if I believe there's a good chance of closing the deal.
* **Accept John's Offer:**  If Bob's counteroffer remains too low, I'll accept John's offer to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer as my budget is quite tight, but I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, even though it's close.
* **Risk of Further Lowering:** Further negotiation could potentially lower the price even further, increasing my financial loss.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.

**Next Steps:**

Since John's offer is secure and guaranteed, I'll accept his offer to maximize my profits and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
