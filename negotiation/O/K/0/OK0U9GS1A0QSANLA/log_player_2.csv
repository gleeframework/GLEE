"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, he's willing to pay up to that amount. Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already lowered her price from $11,500 to $11,250.  This is a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $12,000.  He's already saved $750 compared to buying from John.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price, and he risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
