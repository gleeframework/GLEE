Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation ($15,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows potential for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure the Sale:**  The offer is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and provides a good profit margin. It also avoids the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to accept the lower offer from John. 

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of closing the deal at a price favorable to you."
