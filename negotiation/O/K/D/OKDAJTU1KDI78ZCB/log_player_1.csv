Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'll be prepared to lower my price in subsequent counteroffers, but only if Bob's counteroffers demonstrate a serious interest and understanding of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm confident the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I will counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,750,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still far too low. He seems unwilling to meet me even halfway.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a fair price and avoids further negotiations."
