"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $85 for you. Would you like to proceed? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might make her reconsider. However, it's still within a reasonable bargaining range and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your situation, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about if we settle at $75 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with.  I'll counter again and see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her closer to the middle ground.  It keeps the negotiation moving forward and keeps us away from my walk-away price with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how does $72 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my range, but I think there's still room for her to come down a little further.  I'll try one more time to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we settle this right now at $71?  It's a fair price and we both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 71
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to create a sense of urgency while still offering a price slightly below Alice's last offer. It implies that this is my final offer and a good opportunity for her to close the deal.  It's a bit of a gamble, but it might just work."
