Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good price, starting at $120, which is significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I've chosen a price that gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a better price.
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  Even if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find something within my budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than $80 from John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price and my initial offer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also sticking to a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and aims to keep the negotiation open. 
* **Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason why $110 is a good deal, highlighting its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $105 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  $105 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $80. 
* **Finality:**  Bob has stated that $105 is his limit, so further negotiation might not yield a better price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out to John."
