"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm not quite ready to drop to $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,225,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're definitely close to making this work.  While I'm aiming for a bit higher, I'm willing to consider a final offer. How about $1,180,000, and we close the deal? This is my best and final offer.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
