"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider selling it to me for $10,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
