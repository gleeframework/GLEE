"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and go with $15000? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $12000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
