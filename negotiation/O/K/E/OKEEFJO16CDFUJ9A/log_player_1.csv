Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000.  I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $20,000 is significantly higher than your minimum price of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:** It's not an outrageous price that might immediately turn Bob off.

The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the offer. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's reactions and your assessment of his interest. 
* Be prepared to be flexible and willing to counter-offer if necessary.
* Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John if you feel you're not getting a good enough price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below your minimum price of $15,000 and leaves you with very little profit.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, his message indicates that he is interested in the product. This means there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Counter-offering:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to reach a price that is more favorable to you. 

**Next Steps:**

You will need to formulate a counteroffer that:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer:**  A compromise is necessary to keep negotiations going.
* **Is still above your minimum:**  You shouldn't settle for anything less than $15,000. 
* **Clearly communicates your willingness to negotiate:**  Your message should be friendly and open to further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $15,000 meets you in the middle of your initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating your minimum:**  You've clearly stated your minimum price, letting Bob know that you won't go any lower.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and invites further discussion.

**Key Points:**

* This counteroffer is a good compromise that should keep the negotiations going.
* It's important to monitor Bob's reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly.
* You can always walk away and sell to John if you feel Bob isn't willing to meet your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** $12,000 is below your minimum price of $15,000. While you have shown flexibility, you shouldn't settle for a price that undervalues your product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob is showing interest and has offered a higher price than his previous offer. This suggests there's still room for a compromise.
* **Counter-offering is a better option:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to bridge the gap and reach a price that is more favorable to you.

**Next Steps:**

You need to formulate a counteroffer that:

* **Is above Bob's offer but lower than your previous offer:** You need to continue to show flexibility but still maintain your minimum price.
* **Is closer to your minimum:**  You should aim for a price that is closer to $15,000.
* **Clearly communicates your willingness to negotiate:**  Your message should remain friendly and open to further discussion."

This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** $11,500 is below your minimum price of $15,000. While you have shown flexibility, you shouldn't settle for a price that undervalues your product.
* **Negotiation has stalled:**  Bob has consistently rejected offers that are close to your minimum price. This suggests that a deal at a price you're comfortable with is unlikely.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Given the situation, selling to John for $15,000 guarantees you a fair price and avoids further time-consuming negotiations that may not yield a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

By choosing to sell to John, you are:

* **Maximizing your profit:**  You will receive your minimum price, ensuring a reasonable profit.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  You avoid the risk of spending more time negotiating with Bob, only to end up with a similar or worse outcome.
* **Securing a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John ensures a quick and certain transaction."
