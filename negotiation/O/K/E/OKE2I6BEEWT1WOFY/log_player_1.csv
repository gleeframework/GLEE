"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives him room to negotiate and me a good starting point. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of the product.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for us to agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $1,550,000, which is just above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. This is my last chance to secure a price above my minimum before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting too low with his offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum, and it's getting too risky to keep negotiating with him. I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and secure the sale."
