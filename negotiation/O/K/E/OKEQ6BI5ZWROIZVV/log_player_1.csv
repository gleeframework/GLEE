Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is currently offering our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee he'll go higher in future rounds, and we risk him walking away entirely. Since John offers our minimum with no negotiation, it's the safest and most logical choice to sell to him now."
