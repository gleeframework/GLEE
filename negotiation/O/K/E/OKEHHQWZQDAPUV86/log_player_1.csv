{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures you won't be forced to go below your minimum.

By starting at $120, you leave room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer while still staying well above your minimum price."
