I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit low, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $950,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference at $1,025,000? This is a fair offer, and we can both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more time to get a better price.  $900,000 is very close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can negotiate a few more dollars.  If Bob refuses, I'll sell to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I would prefer to get more, Bob is clearly not willing to go higher, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John will still give me a profit and allow me to move on to other opportunities."
