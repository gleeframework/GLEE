Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the value for Bob (""great deal,"" ""very valuable"") helps him see the benefit of accepting.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I have the option of accepting a counteroffer or selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. 
* **John as a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000.  It's still a great price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  $13,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm flexible.
* **Reaffirming Value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Open-ended Question:** The message encourages Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12,200. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $12,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer could build a positive relationship with Bob for future potential sales.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing negotiations could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a higher price. 
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of Bob backing out completely."
