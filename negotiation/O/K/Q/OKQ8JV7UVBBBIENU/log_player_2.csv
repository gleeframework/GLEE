{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer, as it's significantly higher than your target price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with my target price, as this is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This sets the tone for the negotiation and demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair deal."

Alice's offer is still too high, even after our first counteroffer.  We need to continue to negotiate to get closer to our target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in accepting to close the deal."

Alice's offer remains too high.  It's time to increase our counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm increasing my offer by another $100,000 to reach $1,000,000. This further shows my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we've reached a point where the negotiation is unlikely to produce a better deal.  It's more prudent to buy the product from John at a guaranteed price of $800,000, even if it means forgoing potential future savings."
