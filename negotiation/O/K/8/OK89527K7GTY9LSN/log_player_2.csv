Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which would be $825,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.

While I could try to push Alice further down, getting the price to $825,000 represents a significant saving and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely and still keeps me well under my $800,000 maximum."
