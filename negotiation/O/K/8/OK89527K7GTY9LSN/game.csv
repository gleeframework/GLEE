"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This is my final counteroffer for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which would be $825,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
