"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is a fair price given my budget. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Bob,4,
