"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  $1,400,000 is still too high, and Bob has a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product is worth closer to my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would represent a significant saving for you compared to the full value you'd gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,350,000 is a good price, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000, and he's getting a solid deal compared to John's offer.  There's a good chance Alice won't come down further, and there's always the risk of the deal falling through if Bob keeps rejecting offers."
