"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This offer takes into account your valuation while ensuring the deal remains worthwhile for me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
