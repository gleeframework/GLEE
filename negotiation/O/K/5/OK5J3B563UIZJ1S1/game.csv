"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $250 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise!  $175 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? Let's see if we can make this happen.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $150. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $170 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,
