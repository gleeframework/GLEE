"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Alice's first offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.

While $700,000 is closer to my target, I'll try one more time to see if Alice might be willing to go a little lower.  It's still better than John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I'm going to counteroffer at $720,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000

Alice is clearly holding firm, and $720,000 is a reasonable price. It's better to accept now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John's higher price."
