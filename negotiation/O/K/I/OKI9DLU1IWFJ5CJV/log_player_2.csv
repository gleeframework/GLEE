"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is a very high price for Bob, and he should definitely reject the offer. He can either try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob is going to try and get the product for his maximum value. He knows that John is willing to sell for $8,000, so that is his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. It's also possible that she won't go any lower, and Bob risks losing the deal entirely if he rejects again. At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the offer and save some money compared to buying from John."
