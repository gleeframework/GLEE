"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable for you, for $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $14,000 is less than $15,000.
* **It's still within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to spend up to $15,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob to save money."
