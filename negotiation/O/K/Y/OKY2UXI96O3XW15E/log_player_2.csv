"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since my maximum is $1,200,000, I can try to get the price lower by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is very close to my counteroffer.  Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, accepting her offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. This deal is still well within my budget and gets me the product without further negotiation."
