Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. It's worth a lot more to you than that, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $112 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - $118. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 118}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $114
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $120."
