Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a bit more flexibility. I'm willing to make another small concession. I can offer you a price of $920,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $920,000 is a good deal and significantly below my $1,000,000 maximum. There's a risk Alice might not budge much further, and it's better to secure the product at a good price now."
