"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Could you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to work with me.  $925,000 is very close, but I need to stay firm on my budget. How about we settle at $910,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a bit more flexibility. I'm willing to make another small concession. I can offer you a price of $920,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",920000.0,Alice,7,
