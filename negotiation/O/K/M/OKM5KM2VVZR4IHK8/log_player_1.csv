Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it provides significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting high allows for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.
* **Justifying the price:** Highlighting the ""significant value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from just his initial valuation.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in the negotiation and are willing to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob pushes back."
