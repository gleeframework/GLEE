"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the market value and I think it's a good compromise.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I'll offer you the product for $13250. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $13250. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12800. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
