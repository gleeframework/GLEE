"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This achieves two things:
    * **Anchoring:** It sets a high reference point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it outright, his counteroffers are likely to be higher than if I started lower.
    * **Room to Negotiate:**  This gives me ample space to make concessions throughout the 10 rounds, fostering a sense of progress and making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal. 

* **Justification:** My message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high asking price without revealing my own valuations.

* **Strategy:** My goal is to gradually lower the price over the rounds, strategically responding to Bob's reactions and counteroffers. I'll aim for a final price significantly above his $1,000,000 valuation while remaining aware of the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, given its potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss compared to selling to John. While his offer is above his perceived value, it doesn't warrant accepting at this stage. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers a unique set of benefits that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you in the long run. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  While I'm coming down by $350,000, I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value.

* **Long-Term Value Emphasis:**  I'm subtly shifting the focus to long-term benefits to justify the higher price, playing on potential future gains Bob might experience.

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move substantially from his initial offer. His response will reveal more about his negotiation strategy and potential for reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for your offer.  I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased to $1,300,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe there's still a chance to reach a price point that's beneficial for both of us.  I'll aim to guide the negotiation closer to my target range in the upcoming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price. I'm willing to make a significant move to show my commitment to getting this deal done. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Offering to ""meet halfway"" frames the counteroffer as a fair and balanced solution. While not a true 50/50 split, it creates that impression and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a significant concession. 

* **Anchoring Above Minimum:**  The $1,600,000 price point is strategically chosen. It's:
    * Above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000, leaving room for potential further negotiation.
    * Significantly above Bob's current offer, signaling I'm serious about the higher value.

* **Time Pressure:**  As we're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation, introducing a sense of urgency can be beneficial. Bob might be more motivated to reach an agreement sooner rather than risk the deal falling apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being willing to compromise. I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and represents a significant gain for me compared to his initial offers. While I could push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or that further negotiation wouldn't yield a significantly better result. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
