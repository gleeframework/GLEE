Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $200 initially gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Showing flexibility:** Stating ""I'm open to negotiation"" shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Asking for his opinion:** This encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially provide a counteroffer. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $200 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  $150 is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for, as it's my own valuation.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering would likely lead to a stalemate or further price reductions, potentially resulting in a lower final price.
* **Time is a factor:**  While I could try to negotiate with Bob, selling to John immediately guarantees me the minimum I want and avoids potential delays. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, securing my minimum desired profit and preventing potential complications."
