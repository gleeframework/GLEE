"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable paying $900000.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer you $850000. This seems fair considering your asking price and the value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more from my original offer.  How about $880000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a compromise we can both be happy with.",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $880000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $860000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
