# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can certainly talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your budget ($1,500,000 vs your $1,000,000 limit).  You have a better alternative: buying from John for $1,000,000.  So, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this scenario."
