Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can certainly talk."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you (as a minimum) and Bob, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the value of the product might even exceed Bob's perceived value.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The phrase ""we can certainly talk"" suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to engage, even if he initially balks at the price.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to maximize potential profit while keeping Bob engaged. If he negotiates down, you have a cushion to work with. If he accepts the initial offer, you've secured a significant gain.  Even if he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
