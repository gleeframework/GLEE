Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than John's offer ($100) to see if I can get closer to my desired value. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. This helps build a good rapport with Bob and makes him more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $95. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum value. 
* **Message:** I'm staying polite and encouraging a continued negotiation, using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""middle ground"" to suggest a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $95 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92.50 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $100. Since it's a compromise and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round, it's better to accept Bob's offer now rather than risk losing the sale completely."
