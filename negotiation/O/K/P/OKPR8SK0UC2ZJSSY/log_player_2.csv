Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,500. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further back-and-forth."
