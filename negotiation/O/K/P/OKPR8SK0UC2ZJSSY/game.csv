"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
