"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me. To be honest, $700,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
