"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $980,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
