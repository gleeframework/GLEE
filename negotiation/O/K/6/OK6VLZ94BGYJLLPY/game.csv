"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price of $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
