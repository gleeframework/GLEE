Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to give me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to gauge his interest and potentially get him to counter-offer. 

This approach allows for flexibility in the negotiation while establishing a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John would yield the same amount, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to potentially build a relationship for future transactions."
