Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer. I'm not yet ready to sell to John. I'll counter Bob with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you're placing on the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get a higher price than $1,250,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counter Bob with a slightly lower offer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort you're making. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1275000. This price aims to reflect a compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I'd prefer, it's getting closer to my desired price.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price. Selling to Bob for $1,275,000 is still a significant profit, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
