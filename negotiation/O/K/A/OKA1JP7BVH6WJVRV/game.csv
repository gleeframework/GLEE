"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a great deal for both of us!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the counteroffer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. Can you meet me at $95? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $105 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $108? It's still a great deal for you, and it's getting close to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement!",108.0,Alice,7,
