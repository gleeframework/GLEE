"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? This would allow us both to make a decent profit.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a profit, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to pay. Let's see if we can make this happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
