"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000.  It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a major asset for you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit potential while allowing me to recoup some of the value of this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it offers you a great deal. Let's seal the deal and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's offer of $800,000.  At this point, you're better off securing the deal with John and avoiding further negotiation."
