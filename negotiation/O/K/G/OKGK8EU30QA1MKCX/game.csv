"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000.  It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a major asset for you. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit potential while allowing me to recoup some of the value of this exceptional product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it offers you a great deal. Let's seal the deal and make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
