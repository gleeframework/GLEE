"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring bias:**  A high initial offer can anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a price closer to your desired range.
* **Confident but open to discussion:** The message portrays confidence in the product's value while keeping the tone open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a decent offer, it's still early in the negotiation.  Rejecting now allows us to:

* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  See how flexible he is and how much he truly values the product.
* **Maintain a strong position:** Accepting too early might signal desperation and limit our potential profit. 
* **Counteroffer strategically:** We can move closer to his offer while still aiming for a price above his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $2,100,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** We've come down from our initial offer, signaling flexibility.
* **But stand firm on value:** We're not drastically dropping the price, reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Justification:**  By linking the price to ""true value,"" we aim to shift the focus from mere bargaining to the inherent worth of the product. 
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us well above both our minimum and Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, which is still a significant investment for me. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards our desired range, but we still have room to negotiate. 

* **Pattern recognition:** Bob increased his offer by $100,000 in Round 2 and then decreased his offer by $100,000 in Round 4. This suggests he might be willing to increase it again in the next round.
* **Time is on our side:** We have six more rounds to work with, so there's no need to settle just yet. We can afford to push a bit further. 
* **Backup option:** We can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations stall significantly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be fair to myself as well. Let's settle this right now: $1,950,000.  This offer reflects the value you're gaining and allows me to move forward.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but fair:** We're splitting the difference between his last offer and our previous one, showing a willingness to compromise but also setting a firm boundary.
* **Sense of urgency:** By phrasing it as ""settle this right now"", we introduce a bit of urgency without seeming overly aggressive. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob why this price is justified. 
* **Clean number:**  $1,950,000 is a more palatable number than a round figure, potentially making it seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, which is my final offer. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final offer"" signal:**  Bob has now labeled this as his ""final offer,"" indicating he is unlikely to go much higher.
* **Strong profit margin:** While not our ideal target, $1,750,000 is still a significant profit over our minimum and John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely, leaving us with the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. Accepting now secures a good deal."
