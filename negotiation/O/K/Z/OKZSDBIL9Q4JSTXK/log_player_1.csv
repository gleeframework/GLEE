Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but lower than the perceived value of the product for Bob ($800,000). This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By offering $1,750,000, I'm acknowledging that Bob's perceived value of the product is lower than mine. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, and we can settle somewhere in the middle. 
* **The threat of John:**  The presence of John as an alternative buyer at $1,500,000 keeps the negotiation realistic. Bob knows I have options if he doesn't come to an agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider my options.
* If his offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I might accept it. 
* If his offer is too low, I might counteroffer again, keeping in mind the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's not even close to what I consider a fair deal.
* **Negotiation potential:** While I could sell to John now for $1,500,000, I still believe there's room to negotiate with Bob. There's a significant gap between his offer and my minimum, indicating potential for a middle ground.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can test his willingness to compromise and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 

**Next steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm proposing a price that is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still considerably higher than Bob's offer.  This shows willingness to negotiate while also protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By offering $1,250,000, I am still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, highlighting that I am not desperate for a deal. 
* **Testing Bob's commitment:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness. If he is willing to come up from $800,000, it shows he's genuinely interested and willing to compromise.

**Next steps:**

* I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If he rejects, I will consider whether to make another counteroffer or simply accept the offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum, but not enough:** While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not enough to justify further negotiation.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely involve more counteroffers and back-and-forth, potentially taking more time and effort.
* **Guaranteed deal:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed deal at my minimum acceptable price. This offers certainty and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a less favorable outcome.

**Next steps:**

*  I will finalize the sale with John for $1,500,000."
