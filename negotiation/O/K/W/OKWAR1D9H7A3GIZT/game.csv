"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident I can get the value I need from this product, but I can only go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and believe it's worth the value, but my budget is set at $10,000. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let me know your final decision.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer it to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.
