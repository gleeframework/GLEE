Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. However, I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even if Bob doesn't perceive it as worth that much to him specifically. 
* **Open to Discussion:** Showing a willingness to negotiate can make Bob more receptive to the initial high price.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're in a strong position. You can negotiate down towards his perceived value, knowing you have a backup buyer."
