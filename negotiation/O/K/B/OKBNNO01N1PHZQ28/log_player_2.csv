"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $13,500 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,500 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should start negotiating with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about meeting halfway at $11,000? This price reflects the quality and benefits this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is a significant drop from the initial price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
