Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your company. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This provides room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but also have a firm price point in mind.

This strategy aims to:

* **Engage Bob in negotiation:** Encourage him to make a counteroffer.
* **Maximize your earnings:** Leave room for a price that's closer to your minimum.
* **Maintain leverage:** You can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too far below what I need to sell this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to meet my needs.  I've already made significant concessions and Bob seems unwilling to budge further. To ensure I reach my minimum, I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,500,000."
