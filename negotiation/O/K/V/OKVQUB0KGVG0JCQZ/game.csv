"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would still give you a healthy profit margin.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this exceptional product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. However, $1,225,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I hope it's a price that also works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

After careful consideration, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still recognizes the value you'll get from this product.
