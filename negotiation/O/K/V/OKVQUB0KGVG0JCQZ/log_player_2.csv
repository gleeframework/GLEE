# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this exceptional product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value you see in this product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still recognizes the value you'll get from this product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,175,000 is within your budget and represents a good deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. You can potentially negotiate further, but the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
