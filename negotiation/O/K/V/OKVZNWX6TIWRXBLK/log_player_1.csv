"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate. Bob clearly values the product at $150, so I can likely get closer to my ideal price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Maintaining Value:** Selling to John for $80 is my absolute last resort. I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the product's value.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob that $105 still represents a significant discount compared to his perceived value of $150. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob has moved up to $95, which is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to sell to John for $80.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While $95 is not my ideal price, it's a good starting point for a potential future relationship with Bob. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a decent profit while leaving the door open for future negotiations."
