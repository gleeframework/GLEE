"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90. This means there's room for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay up to $100, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $87.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $87.50 is closer to your desired price point, but there's still a bit of room for negotiation.  You're still saving money compared to buying from John.
* You're aiming for a price closer to $85, so it's worth rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. I'm still not quite there with $87.50.  How about we split the difference and go with $86.25?  That feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86.25}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $86.25 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $88. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's final offer of $88 is still within your budget of $100 and only $2 more than your last counteroffer.
* You've already gone back and forth several times, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price.
*  You'd be saving $12 by accepting the offer compared to buying from John."
