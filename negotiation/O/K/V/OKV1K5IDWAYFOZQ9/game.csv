"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $87.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. I'm still not quite there with $87.50.  How about we split the difference and go with $86.25?  That feels like a fair price for both of us.",86.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $86.25 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $88. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my final offer.",88.0,Alice,5,
