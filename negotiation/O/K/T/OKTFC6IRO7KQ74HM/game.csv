"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. Is this something you'd be interested in?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $175. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product from you.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $137.50. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm going to offer you $155. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",155.0,Alice,5,
