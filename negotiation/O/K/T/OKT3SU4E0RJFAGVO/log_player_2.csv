Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I'm glad we're able to negotiate a fair price. Considering our positions, how about we settle at $112.5 for the product? This is a bit higher than your last offer but still below my initial asking price. Let me know if this works for you.

``` 

Alice is strategically negotiating, and we're unlikely to get a price much lower than $112.5.  Accepting this offer gets us the product below our $120 maximum and avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price closer to John's offer."
