``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob while still ensuring you're not giving away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll still get a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Unfortunately, I still can't meet your price. I'm willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I must stick to my maximum budget of $8,500. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not convinced I can get a better price from Bob. He's consistently sticking to his maximum budget, and my counteroffers aren't swaying him.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
