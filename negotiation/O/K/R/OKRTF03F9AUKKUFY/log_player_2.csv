# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to her, so I'm sure she's making a profit, and I can get it from John for $150, which is within my budget.
