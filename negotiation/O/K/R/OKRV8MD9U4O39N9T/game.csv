"Bob, I believe this product has incredible potential for your company, and I'm confident it will be worth more than $1.5 million to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's discuss this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations for this product.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to show my commitment to a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to your company. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
