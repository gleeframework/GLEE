"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  However, I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I understand this product has value for you, but for me, it's worth a maximum of $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your honesty.  I appreciate your perspective. I can't sell it for $800,000, but I'm willing to be flexible if you are. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the real value of this product in the current market.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm not comfortable going above my initial offer of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm selling.  While I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
