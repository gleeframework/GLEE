"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I've done some research and I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $9750 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $9750 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle for $10125? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this negotiation, I believe we are very close.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I don't think I can go any higher. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
