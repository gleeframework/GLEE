Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above my minimum value. How about $850,000?  This still leaves room for negotiation, and it's a price that reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose $825,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum value of $800,000 and is a good deal for me, considering there's a risk of losing the deal in the next few rounds or having to sell to John at a lower price."
