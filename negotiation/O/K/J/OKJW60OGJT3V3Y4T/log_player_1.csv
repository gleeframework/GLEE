Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, I know I need to come down significantly. If he counters, it indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a secure option, ensuring I won't be forced to sell below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I could do $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and my initial offer.  There's room for negotiation, but accepting such a low offer immediately would be a significant loss. I'll counter-offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand that my initial price might have seemed high, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by significantly lowering my price.  
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $90 offer is:
    * Still above my minimum ($100), giving me a small profit if accepted.
    * Closer to Bob's perceived value ($80), making it a more tempting offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** I don't want to drop my price too drastically, as it might undervalue the product in Bob's eyes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed sale to John.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $100 ensures I make a profit and avoids further negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
