"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's way too high! Alice is starting very high above your maximum price and John's offer. You should counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I could do $60."", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a low counter-offer gives you the most room to negotiate upwards. While $60 is very low, it's a strong opening move to see how much Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand that my initial price might have seemed high, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, but $90 is still above your maximum price and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further down towards your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying below my maximum price and John's offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice while moving closer to a potential deal."
