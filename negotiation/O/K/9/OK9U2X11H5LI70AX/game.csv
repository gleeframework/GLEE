"Bob, I have a unique product I think you'll be very interested in. It has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm asking for $1000000 for it, but I'm open to discussing the price further. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to offer $700000 for the product, given its potential. I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come down a bit more.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $700000.  The product's true potential is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $850000?  I believe this price is fair considering the value you'll gain from it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. To be fair, I'm willing to go up to $800000.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point there.",800000.0,Bob,4,
