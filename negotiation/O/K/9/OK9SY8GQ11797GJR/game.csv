"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $18000? It's still a great price for a product of this quality.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still willing to work with you, but $16000 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference - $17000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I hear you, but $16500 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to compromise just a bit more. How about $17000? This is really my final offer.  I believe it's fair, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,7,
