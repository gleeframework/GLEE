{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving me room to negotiate. I've also made it clear I'm open to discussing the price, making Bob more likely to counteroffer and start a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation and am interested, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to counteroffer at $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe there might be room for negotiation. I would like to counteroffer at $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum threshold.  While I could potentially keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing Bob altogether. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
