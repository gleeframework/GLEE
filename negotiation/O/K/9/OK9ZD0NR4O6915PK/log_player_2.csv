"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.
* It's not worth accepting this offer.
* It's also too early to buy from John since you haven't even explored Alice's counteroffers. 
* You have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $100.  This is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $180.
* I'm hoping to get Alice to come down in price. 
* I'm also trying to get a feel for how much Alice is willing to negotiate.
* I have 9 rounds left and can continue to adjust my counteroffers based on Alice's responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $140 is still above my maximum budget of $120.
* However, it's closer to my target price than her previous offer.
* It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get her down further.
* I have 8 rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has already dropped her price from $180 to $140, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Alice's current offer of $140. 
* This signals that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still trying to save as much money as possible.
* I have 7 rounds left and can continue to adjust my counteroffers based on Alice's responses."
