"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's a fair price that still allows you to get a great product within your budget.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $10,000 - that's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
