Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've been considering your offers, and I think $100 is still the best price for me. Would you be able to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Even though Bob is sticking to $100, I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John.  It's possible that Bob might be willing to compromise a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $100. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $100 is the most I can realistically pay. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to budge from his $100 offer. I've already made several counteroffers, and I'm running out of rounds. At this point, it's more profitable to sell to John for $120, even though it's not my ideal price."
