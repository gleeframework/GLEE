The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is $1,075,000.  It's unlikely Bob will go much higher than that, and Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay her full asking price, it makes more sense to sell to John and secure the higher amount."
