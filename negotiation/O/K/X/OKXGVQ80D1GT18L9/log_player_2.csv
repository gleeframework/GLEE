"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range. It gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $1,000,000 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Position:** This offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will give us valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects its value while still offering you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down slightly from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still above our maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her message indicates she's open to finding a compromise. We need to continue negotiating to see if we can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand this product represents a significant investment, but $1,300,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Our Limit:**  We've reached our absolute maximum price. This offer makes it clear that we are serious but also unwilling to go beyond our budget.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing it as a ""fair deal"" and meeting ""in the middle,"" we're trying to nudge Alice towards a yes while maintaining firmness on our end. 
* **Backup Option:** We still have John's offer as a backup if Alice is unwilling to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle, but the product's intrinsic value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while recognizing your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached an Impasse:** Alice has shown she is unwilling to go below $1,225,000, which exceeds our strict $1,000,000 limit.  
* **Time is Valuable:** Continued negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap, and we risk losing the guaranteed deal with John. 
* **John's Offer is Solid:** Buying from John ensures we get the product at the best possible price, saving us a significant amount of money."
