"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects its value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand this product represents a significant investment, but $1,300,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle, but the product's intrinsic value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while recognizing your interest.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
