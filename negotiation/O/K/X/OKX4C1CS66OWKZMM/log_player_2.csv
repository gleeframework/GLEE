Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your position, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.
