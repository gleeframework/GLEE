"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $1,600,000?  This still leaves room for negotiation, but it's closer to a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
