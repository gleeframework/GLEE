,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and presenting yours. I'm willing to negotiate but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
