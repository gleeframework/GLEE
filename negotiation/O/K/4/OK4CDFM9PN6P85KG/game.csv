"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I could potentially do $12,000.  That would be a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,000. However, I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $16,000. I think this is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,7,
