I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.

Round 6
