Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth so much to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't get me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I won't drop my price that significantly.  I'll make a counteroffer to try to bridge the gap, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer represents a significant concession from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
