"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at $80, but I'd be willing to go up to $82 if you really can't do $80?",82.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from your proposed price. I can offer you the product for $87. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $5.",87.0,Alice,5,
