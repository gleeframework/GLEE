"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is a significant step closer to his target price of $1,200,000.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.  It also gives Bob some room to maneuver in future rounds if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and can likely achieve a price closer to $1,200,000 with further counteroffers. It's not yet time to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1260000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping his target price in mind. A counteroffer of $1,260,000 demonstrates a commitment to reaching an agreement while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's target, it's still $70,000 above it.  There are still rounds left, and Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and there's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to Bob's target in the next few rounds.  There's no need to rush into buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1220000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily increasing his offer, and now it's time to make a more significant jump to show Alice he's serious about closing the deal at a price close to his target.  This offer is only $20,000 above his maximum, and it's likely to be accepted by Alice, who is also eager to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,240,000 is only $40,000 above Bob's maximum price. This is a small difference, and with only a few rounds left, it's a good deal for Bob.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob doesn't want to risk missing out on the deal entirely. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price that is close to his target and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
