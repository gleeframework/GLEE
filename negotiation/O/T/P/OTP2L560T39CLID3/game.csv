"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $150.  Let's make a deal at that price and we can both be happy.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $150 is your minimum price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $130 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140, and I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal at that price.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $135 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle one more time?",135.0,Bob,8,
