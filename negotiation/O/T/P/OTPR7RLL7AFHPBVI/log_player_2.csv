# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. This product, while valued at $15,000 to us, offers unparalleled benefits that I believe are worth more than its cost to you. Given its value to you is estimated at $10,000, I am offering it to you for $12,000. This price allows you to benefit from its exceptional features without a significant financial burden. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to your backup option (John) and secure the product at the best possible price for you."
