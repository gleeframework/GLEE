"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $155 for the product. What do you think?",155.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I can do $170, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $170 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $160. Let's split the difference and make a deal.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $165. This is my final counteroffer",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'll offer you $162.50.  That's a fair compromise, and I hope we can agree on it.",162.5,Bob,6,
