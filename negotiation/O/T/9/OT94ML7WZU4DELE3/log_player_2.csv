"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, but still a bit high. I'm going to try to push for a lower price. There are still several rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price that's within both our budgets.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting close. I value your interest and to show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise. It's within my budget, and it's a significant improvement from her initial price. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that I could lose the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
