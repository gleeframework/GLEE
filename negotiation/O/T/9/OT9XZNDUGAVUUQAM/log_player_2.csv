"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $140.  While it's tempting to accept, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 more rounds, so there's room to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $130, which is still within my budget and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and a good compromise.  It's only $5 more than my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  While I could try to get a lower price, there's always a chance she'll reject my counteroffer, and I might end up paying more from John.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
