Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This is the best option.  While I could try to push for more, Bob has signaled that $800,000 is his absolute maximum. Accepting this offer guarantees I make a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
