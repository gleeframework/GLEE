Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's Interest:** I mention the product's worth to him, implying a potential good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I'll  consider his counter-offer, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if it's not worth my time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's still a profit for me, it's much lower than I would like to get.
* **Room for counter-offering:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point by making a counter-offer.
* **Not desperate to sell:** I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? It's a good deal for both of us, and I believe you'll really value this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Maintain Confidence:** I remain confident about the product's value while still being open to finding a mutually agreeable solution."
