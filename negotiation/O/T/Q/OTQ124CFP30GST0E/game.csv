"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget better.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we try $13,750? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.
