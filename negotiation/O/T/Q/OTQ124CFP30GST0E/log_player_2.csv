"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll really appreciate its features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He has a higher ceiling of $15,000, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget better."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we try $13,750? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. He'll try one more counteroffer to see if they can meet in the middle."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  How about $13,000?  It's a fair price, and it's much closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $13,250? This is a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is very close to his target price.  While he could continue negotiating, the potential savings are small.  Accepting the offer for $13,250 ensures he gets the product for a decent price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or having to pay John's higher price."
