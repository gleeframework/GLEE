Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $18000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $18000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $16000? I think we could find a mutually beneficial solution.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $16000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $18000 and $16000. How about $17000? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While $17000 is closer, I still feel there's room for negotiation. Could you consider $16500? This would allow us to reach a compromise without straining my budget too much.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go below $17000. I'm willing to make a small concession and meet you at $17250. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. What do you think?",17250.0,Alice,5,
