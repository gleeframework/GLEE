{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to entice Bob. It's also not too far from what I know he's willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product below my minimum of $100 just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. I can't go as low as $85 right now, but I'm willing to do $90.  It's a good deal for both of us, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $90. How about $87? I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. $87 is too low for me. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $87. How about we meet in the middle at $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $88. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.

At this point, I'm tired of negotiating and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed sale and I'm happy with the price."
