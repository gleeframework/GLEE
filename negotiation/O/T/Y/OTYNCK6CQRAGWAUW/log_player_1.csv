Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial price is far too high for me.  This product is valuable, but not at that level. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial asking price.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the initial offer, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle somewhere around $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our minimum price. Holding firm now is likely to yield a better result than accepting his offer or going to John. We're still in the early stages of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer.  Bob is consistently increasing his offer, showing willingness to pay.  By splitting the difference again, we show flexibility but maintain a strong position above our $1,000,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting closer to a price point I can work with.  Would you be willing to come down just a bit more, say to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now above our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he walks away, and we'd lose out on the $50,000 profit. It's a good deal and time to close."
