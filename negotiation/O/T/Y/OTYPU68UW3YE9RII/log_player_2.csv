"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $180. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $150 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit of $120. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only do $130.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a fair middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is the highest price I can go for now. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice's offer of $140 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $120. Since John is offering the product for $120, Bob should take that offer to avoid paying more."
