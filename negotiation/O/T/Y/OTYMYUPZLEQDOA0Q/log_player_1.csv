Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for some room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob thinking about the product's worth.  I'll be keeping an eye on his response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not convinced that it's the best I can get from Bob.  I'm going to counter with a higher price in the hopes of closing the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a higher price point than his offer.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my desired range that it's not worth risking further negotiation.  The potential for a longer negotiation could lead to a lower price or even a deal falling through."
