Round 2

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  We're getting closer! How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine?  Would you do it for $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $13,500 is a solid deal. It exceeds his perceived value of $10,000 and gives me a reasonable profit above my minimum.  There's always a risk Bob might walk away if I push further, so accepting now secures the sale."
