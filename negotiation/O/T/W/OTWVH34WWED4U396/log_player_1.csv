"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's value while leaving space for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell it for that price. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate the offer, $100 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
