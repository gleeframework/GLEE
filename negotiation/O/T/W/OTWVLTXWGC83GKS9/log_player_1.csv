Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will bite at a price just below that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, offering $119 leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting you even closer to your guaranteed price.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Starting at your maximum price ($120) might discourage Bob immediately.  A slightly lower offer seems more appealing. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119.  However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still ensuring you don't sell for less than your guaranteed amount."
