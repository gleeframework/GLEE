Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $950,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter his offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on both our parts. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer and see if we can find common ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $885,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward with this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 885000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally prefer a price closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $880,000 is still a good deal and significantly higher than what I could get from John.  With only 4 rounds left, it's time to secure the sale."
