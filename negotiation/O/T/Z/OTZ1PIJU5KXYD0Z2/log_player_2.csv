"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, it's worth more than $120 to you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $100, which is a significant discount compared to its market value. This is an opportunity not to be missed, as it represents a substantial saving for you. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a savings of $20.
* **Alice's offer is likely better than what you would get elsewhere.**  While Alice mentions a ""market value"" higher than $120, it's unclear if that's realistic.  Since you're willing to pay $120, it's safe to assume you've already checked other options."
