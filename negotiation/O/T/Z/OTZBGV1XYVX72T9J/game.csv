"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $82.50?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",80.0,Bob,4,
