"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to consider $1100000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1100000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  Would you consider $1050000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1100000, so I'm offering $1075000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,,
