"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it at that price just yet. I believe I can get a higher price, especially since Bob rejected my initial offer. I'll proceed to the next round and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. It's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.  I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $9,000. Bob is showing that he's not willing to pay much more than $8,500, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. This offer is still significantly higher than my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my desired price point!  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal.  This is a good outcome for me, as I'm able to sell the product for a higher price than my minimum acceptable value."
