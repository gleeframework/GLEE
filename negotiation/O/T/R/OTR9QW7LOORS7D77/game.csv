"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still allowing me to purchase the product at a reasonable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I propose a new price of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given the value I place on the product. I hope this proposal will lead us closer to reaching an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a new price of $915000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I hope it will be acceptable to you. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",915000.0,Alice,5,
