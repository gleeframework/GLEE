"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be workable for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $1,050,000. I'm willing to give you a bit more room to maneuver, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your last offer. How about $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your last offer. If we can't meet in the middle, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
