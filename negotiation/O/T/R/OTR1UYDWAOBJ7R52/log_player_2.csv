Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is not a price I'm comfortable with.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $1,050,000. I'm willing to give you a bit more room to maneuver, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your last offer. If we can't meet in the middle, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

This is a good time to accept the offer. Alice is signaling that she's nearing her limit and might consider other options. While you could try to negotiate further, you risk pushing her away and potentially ending up with John's offer, which is significantly higher. Accepting the $1,000,000 saves you a considerable amount compared to both John's price and Alice's initial offer."
