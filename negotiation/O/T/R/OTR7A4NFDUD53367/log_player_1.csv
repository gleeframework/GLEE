Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even exceeding the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value but potentially acceptable if he sees the product as valuable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to his $10,000 valuation while still securing me a profit beyond John's offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as an opportunity for Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, the approach might change based on Bob's responses and willingness to engage."
