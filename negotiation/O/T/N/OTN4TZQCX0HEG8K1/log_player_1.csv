"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong anchor price well above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value helps justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting point signals that you're open to negotiation, but it doesn't give away your bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to meet you halfway and let it go for $1,750,000. This reflects its true worth and is a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We're coming down from the initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strong Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value helps maintain a firm stance on the price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The counter-offer of $1,750,000 keeps the negotiation active while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum. This provides room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards your target price, but you are still in a position to negotiate further. While selling to John is now a more appealing option, there's still a potential $100,000 difference between Bob's offer and your guaranteed sale. Let's see if we can close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction and my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal a firm stance.
* **Significant Concession (but not too much):** You've made a $150,000 concession from your previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price well above Bob's last offer and your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Focus on Closing:** The message aims to move towards a final decision, encouraging Bob to accept the offer rather than prolonging the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's no further room for negotiation, and continuing the discussion carries the risk of him lowering his offer. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome in this situation."
