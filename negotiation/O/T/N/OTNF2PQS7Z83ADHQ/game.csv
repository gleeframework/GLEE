"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly based on its potential.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
