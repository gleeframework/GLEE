,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $90.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and we can finalize the transaction.",90.0,Bob,4,
