Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession.

This is the best choice for a few reasons:

* **Alice is at her limit:**  She's clearly stated that $800,000 is the lowest she'll go. 
* **It's a good deal:** You're getting the product for $400,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly less than John's offer. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield better results:** Continuing might just waste time and potentially sour the deal."
