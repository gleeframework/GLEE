"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to recoup most of my investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10500. This would give you a good price and allow me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit far off from $10500. I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. Can you meet me in the middle?,9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close but $9800 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go to $10000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the point where I think I can get a better deal from John. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but I need you to come down to that price. Can you make it happen?",9800.0,Bob,6,
