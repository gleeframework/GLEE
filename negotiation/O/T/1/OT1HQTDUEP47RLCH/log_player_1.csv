Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth more than that to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum of $100, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. 
* **The message:** I'm friendly and encouraging Bob to see the value in the product. I'm also highlighting the potential benefit for him, which may lead to a smoother negotiation. 

**Important:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident that Bob is likely to accept this offer, as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than selling to John for $100, I'm not going to settle for that just yet. I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. 

* **Reason for rejecting:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $115. 
* **Next steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a compromise between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll get great value from this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This is a compromise price that's closer to my desired price of $115 but still acknowledges Bob's lower offer.
* **The message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing the value Bob will receive at this price. I'm also subtly reminding him that he has expressed interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'd be happy to meet in the middle a bit closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$108 is a good deal:** It's higher than selling to John for $100, and it's only $2 away from my initial offer of $110.
* **Negotiation is time-consuming:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it's also possible to reach a stalemate or that Bob might decide to walk away. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price without risking a lower offer or losing time."
