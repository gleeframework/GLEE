"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. $1,100,000 is too low for me, especially since I know it's worth $1,500,000 to him.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $1,250,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,250,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop the price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to $1,325,000. There are still 4 rounds left, so I have time to keep negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell to John. While I'd like to get a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. John's offer of $1,500,000 is a good price and guarantees me a sale."
