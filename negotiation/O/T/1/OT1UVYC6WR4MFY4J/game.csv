"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $1,250,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop the price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to find common ground.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
