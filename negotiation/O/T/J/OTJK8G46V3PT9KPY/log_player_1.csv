Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding Bob's perceived $10,000, aiming to nudge his perception closer to our asking price.
* **Leaving the door open:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in discussion, making it more likely he'll counter-propose instead of outright rejecting the offer. 

**Important Note:** While we aim high, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However,  we always have John as a fallback, ensuring we never sell below our minimum acceptable price."
