Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality and potential, $2000000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
