Round 2
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit higher. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a very fair offer, and I believe it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 890000}

While I'd like to get closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $880,000 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly more than selling to John, and we're running out of time. I'll take it."
