"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value I place on it and still allows you a significant profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000.  This would allow you to still make a healthy profit, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,000,000. How about we meet at $900,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make it work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $950,000. This price is a good compromise, and it allows you to still make a substantial profit. Let's try to close this deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $950,000. How about we meet at $920,000? This is a good compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",920000.0,Bob,6,
