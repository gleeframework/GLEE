"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I believe its worth to you is even greater. Given that, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if you can get a better price.  Buying from John immediately would be the safest option, but you might be able to save more money by negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my best offer, considering the price John is offering. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. However, I need to be transparent – if we can't agree on a price close to this, I'll be moving forward with John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but she's clearly willing to negotiate. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know if that works for you.  "", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference – $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is within your budget and represents a significant savings compared to her initial asking price. While you could try for a lower price, the risk of her going with John's offer is high.  Accepting this offer secures the product and saves you a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
