"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I believe its worth to you is even greater. Given that, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my best offer, considering the price John is offering. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. However, I need to be transparent – if we can't agree on a price close to this, I'll be moving forward with John's offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know if that works for you.  ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference – $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
