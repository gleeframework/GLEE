Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my best offer, considering the price John is offering.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob is trying to lowball me and is using John as leverage.  I'll counter, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge significantly.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know if that works for you.
