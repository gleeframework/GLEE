Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to lower my price if he counteroffers.  I'm ready to keep negotiating until I reach a price that's acceptable to both of us, or I'll sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly closer to my desired price than my initial offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1 million, accepting his offer guarantees me a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
