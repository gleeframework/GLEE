Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher price ($15,000) gives room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin. 
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning that the product will be offered to someone else creates a sense of urgency and might incentivize Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone of the message is not overly aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

It's important to remember that even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I still have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John."
