"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'll counter with a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  I hope you'll reconsider my offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to your target, but I still need to make a profit. I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value I've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it's the highest I can go.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, $975,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our discussions.  I hope you'll accept this final offer. ",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1,025,000, Bob. I'm starting to think we're not going to find a mutually agreeable price. I'll make one more offer, and it's non-negotiable. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
