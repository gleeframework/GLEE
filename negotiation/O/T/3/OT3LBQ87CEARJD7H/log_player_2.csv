"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $90, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We know we can get it for $80 from John, so we should negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"", ""product_price"": 65}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While we know our walk-away point is $80, we want to start with a significantly lower offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely and expresses interest while clearly stating our counteroffer. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** This counteroffer aims to secure a price significantly below both Alice's asking price and our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about $75?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price we'd consider, but we can still try to get it closer to $70. We're getting close to our walk-away price, but it's worth one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for coming closer, Alice.  I'd be willing to go up to $70, and I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 70}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($75) and our previous offer ($65). This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Near Walk-Away:**  $70 is a good price, and we're very close to our walk-away of $80.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, positive, and reinforces our position."
