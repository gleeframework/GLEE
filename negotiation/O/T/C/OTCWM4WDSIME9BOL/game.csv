"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a significant investment on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you at $950,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This represents a significant investment for me, and I think it's a good compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a premium. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
