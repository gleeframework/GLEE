"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a lower price.  To start, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and provides us both with a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
