"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $8,800 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $9,000, and that's still above your target price.  You're better off buying from John for $12,000. While it's more expensive, it's still within your budget and saves you the time and effort of further negotiation."
