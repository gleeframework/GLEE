"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that you'll love this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  Could we settle on $8,800?  I'm really hoping to make this work, but that's my final offer.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $8,800 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
