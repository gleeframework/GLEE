"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. It's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's try to close this deal!",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,400,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,150,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1,300,000 is my final offer.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's reach a deal!",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer $1,225,000. Can you consider that?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,225,000 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's make this happen!",1275000.0,Alice,7,
