Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $950,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  A higher offer gives me the best chance of getting a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob may counteroffer, and I can then decide whether to accept his offer or hold firm closer to my minimum.
* **Knowing my Floor:**  I know I can always go back to John for $800,000, which allows me to take some risks in negotiation."
