"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $115. It's worth at least $120 to you, so you'd be getting a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $115. 
* This means Bob can save $5 by buying from Alice. 
* Buying from John would cost Bob $120, which is more than Alice's offer. 
* Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
