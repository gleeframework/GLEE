Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $150. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $170? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? I'm willing to compromise and pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $140 is a good outcome. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether."
