Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than my minimum value, so I'm aiming high to see what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial target, it's a decent price and significantly higher than my minimum.  The risk of further negotiation is too high. I could potentially get a better deal, but I also risk ending up with John's offer which is much lower."
