Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a truly unique product.  Its value is immense, and I believe it would be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $1,500,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,500,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value and potential benefit to Bob to pique his interest and encourage him to consider the investment.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Stating I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and makes Bob feel like he has some control in the process. This encourages him to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a high-stakes negotiation, and there's a lot of risk. If Bob immediately rejects this offer, I need to be prepared to lower my price or move on to John. 
* The success of this negotiation depends on the specific product and Bob's financial situation and interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  Bob's interest shows he sees potential value in the product.  I can use this opportunity to negotiate a better price by counter-offering. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is tempting, I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this unique item. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the product's true value while providing you with a significant opportunity.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm counter-offering at $1,200,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the product's value and the opportunity it represents for Bob.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price is a good deal for both of us, which helps frame the negotiation as a win-win situation. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further dialogue and potential agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* If Bob again rejects this offer, I need to assess the situation and potentially consider lowering my price further. 
* I need to be prepared to either sell to John for $1,000,000 or make a final counteroffer that reflects my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further price reductions or a stalemate.  Selling to Bob now guarantees me a quick and clean transaction.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and proceed with the sale."
