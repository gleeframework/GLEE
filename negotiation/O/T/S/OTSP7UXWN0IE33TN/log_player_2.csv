"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd love to offer you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's starting price is too high.**  You're looking to pay no more than $10,000, and her opening offer is $5,000 over your limit.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice has stated the product is worth at least $10,000 to her, indicating she's willing to sell for less than her initial offer. 
* **You have time.**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's no penalty for rejecting offers.  You're in a good position to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given you value it at $10,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for something a little higher.  Let's split the difference. How about $12500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your budget.**  While her counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still $2,500 over your limit.
* **You're still in a strong negotiating position.** You have multiple rounds left, and Alice has demonstrated a willingness to compromise. 
* **You're not losing anything by rejecting.** There's no penalty for rejecting offers, and you have the option of buying from John as a fallback. 

You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only go as high as $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's halfway between our last offers."", ""product_price"": 11000}
