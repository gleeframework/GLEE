"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000, Alice's offer of $1,200,001 exceeds your limit.  It's more beneficial to buy from John at $1,200,000 and save that extra $1."
