Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, knowing that the product is worth at least $100 to me. This gives me a good margin and encourages Bob to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good price, better than my minimum and better than selling to John.  This ends the negotiation successfully."
