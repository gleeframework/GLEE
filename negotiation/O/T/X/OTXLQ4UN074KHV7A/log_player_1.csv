Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,350,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
    *  Attractive compared to your alternative offer ($1,500,000), potentially motivating Bob to accept.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning a ""strong offer lined up"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Negotiation and pricing dynamics can be complex."
