"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. How about $110? I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $125. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",125.0,Alice,5,
