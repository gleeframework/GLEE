Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he has some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a significant benefit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $800,000 and it's likely the best I'll be able to get from him. Accepting his offer is the most rational choice."
