Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It demonstrates you're serious:**  By offering a concrete price, you show you're ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit out of my range. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can likely do better.  You have a good chance of reaching a price closer to your desired range by making a counteroffer.  

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  You can counter with a price slightly lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,750? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13750}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer Strategy:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's. By offering $13,750, you demonstrate flexibility while still staying above your minimum and leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Message Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider your offer.  It highlights the fair value of the price for both parties."
