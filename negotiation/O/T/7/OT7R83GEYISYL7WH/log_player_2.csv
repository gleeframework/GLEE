"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  $10,500 is a reasonable starting point that shows Bob is serious about buying, but also that he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  It's also worth noting that Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, which suggests further negotiation could be fruitful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $10,500. This demonstrates his commitment to this price and shows Alice that he is serious about negotiating a fair deal.  He is also reiterating that this price is beneficial for both of them, subtly implying that he could walk away if Alice doesn't accept."
