Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $10,500 is too low for me right now.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Bob is stuck at $10,500, which is too low for me.  I've made two counteroffers and still haven't been able to get closer to my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000."
