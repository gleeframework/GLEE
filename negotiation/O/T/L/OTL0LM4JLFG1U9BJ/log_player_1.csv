Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. Therefore, we want to start by testing if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to our guaranteed value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A starting price of $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really interested. It also positions us well to potentially meet in the middle, resulting in a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Respectful and open-ended:** The message is framed positively, encouraging Bob to consider the offer and potentially counter-offer."
