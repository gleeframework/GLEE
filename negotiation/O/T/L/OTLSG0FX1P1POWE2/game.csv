"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own personal attachment to it. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
