"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to see if we can make this work. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair offer and would allow us both to walk away happy.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
