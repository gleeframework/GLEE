"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone sets a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit of the product for Bob, suggesting it's a good fit.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm aware that he values the product at $10,000, so this offer will likely be rejected, but it gives me a starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I believe there is room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue exploring a mutually beneficial price. 
* **John is a backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, I still have the opportunity to potentially get a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point. I'll aim to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to see if we can make this work. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my price, highlighting the product's value.
* **Open to Compromise:**  The tone is still positive, showing willingness to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while keeping the negotiation within my desired range.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair offer and would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's still some room for negotiation to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's offer remains safe:**  Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects again, I might need to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). 
* **Fair Outcome:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, highlighting the mutual benefit.
* **Positive and Direct:** The tone is still friendly and encouraging, but I'm becoming more direct about wanting to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strong attempt to reach an agreement quickly.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
