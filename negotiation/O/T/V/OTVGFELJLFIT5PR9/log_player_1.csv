Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to start higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $15,000 gives Bob the impression there might be room for negotiation if he's interested. This also keeps you far above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" of the product to justify the higher price and potentially pique Bob's interest.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, he might try to negotiate down from your asking price. Be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly, but never go below your $12,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  Mentioning other potential buyers or a public listing can sometimes create a sense of urgency, but it can also backfire if Bob isn't that interested."
