"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $16,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $10,000 wouldn't reflect that. How about we meet halfway at $13,000? That's a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,4,
