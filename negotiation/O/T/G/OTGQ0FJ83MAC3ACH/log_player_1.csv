"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might lose him altogether and be stuck selling to John for $12,000.  I'm going to accept his offer and take the $11,500."
