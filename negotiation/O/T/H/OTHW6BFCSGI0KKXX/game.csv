"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can do a bit better than $9,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want to make this work but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle!",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle of my target and your offer, at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,250 is still above my limit. I'm happy to pay $9,750 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your target price than my previous offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
