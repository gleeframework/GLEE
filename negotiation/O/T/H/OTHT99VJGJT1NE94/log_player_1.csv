Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (even if general) can make Bob more receptive.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $150, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, potentially landing you a higher price than $120. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
