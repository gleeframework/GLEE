"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's features, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it and would allow for a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000.  I believe this is a fair price that considers both the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Bob,4,
