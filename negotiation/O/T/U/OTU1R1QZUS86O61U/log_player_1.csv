Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1450000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit margin for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still lower than the initial offer I made.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $1,500,000.  This counteroffer gives him a bit more room to negotiate while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $1,350,000, which is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. It's a good price, and while I'd prefer more, it's worth taking to avoid further back-and-forth."
