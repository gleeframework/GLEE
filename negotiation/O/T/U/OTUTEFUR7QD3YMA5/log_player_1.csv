"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. However, I'm aiming to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be open to that?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there at $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals.
