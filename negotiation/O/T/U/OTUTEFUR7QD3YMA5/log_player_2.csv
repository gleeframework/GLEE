"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value of $10,000. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through negotiation. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. However, I'm aiming to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be open to that?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit.  You've already established that you're willing to pay around $8,500, and it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to budge a little more.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there at $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $8,750 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still offering you a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is within your budget and a good compromise. It's a better deal than buying from John, and you've already established a good negotiation rapport with Alice.  While you might be able to squeeze out another $100 or so, the risk of losing the deal entirely isn't worth it at this point."
