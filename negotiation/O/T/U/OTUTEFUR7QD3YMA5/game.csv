"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. However, I'm aiming to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be open to that?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there at $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $8,750 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still offering you a great deal. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
