"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still within a range that might be acceptable to Bob given its value to him ($800,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm willing to negotiate, which encourages Bob to counteroffer and keeps the conversation open.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the potential value of the product for Bob, making him think about the benefits beyond just the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I need to try and get closer to that value.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this work. How about $1,400,000?  This is a significant compromise from my side, and I'm confident this price would still represent a strong value for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but also firmly stating that it's too low. I'm proposing a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value, but still a significant decrease from my initial offer. 
* **Emphasize value and compromise:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob while highlighting the fact that I'm making a concession. 
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to $1,500,000, indicating that I'm unlikely to budge much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable selling for less than my minimum, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too far off for me. I've thought carefully about our negotiations, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but stand firm:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but remaining firm on my minimum value. I'm offering a counteroffer that's a compromise, but still within my acceptable range.
* **Emphasize concession:** I highlight the fact that I'm making a significant concession to meet him halfway. This encourages Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Urgency and finality:** I add a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to close the deal. The phrase ""Let's make this deal happen"" implies that this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. With only four rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable price are diminishing.  Given that I can sell to John for my desired price, it's more advantageous to close the deal with him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
