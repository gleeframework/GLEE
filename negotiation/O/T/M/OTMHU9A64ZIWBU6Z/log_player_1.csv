Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for potential compromise. It is also lower than Bob's perceived value, making it more likely for him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a better offer than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will reject Bob's offer and counter-offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit above my minimum value. I am confident that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. This ensures a profit above my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
