Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives us room to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $15,000 offer, and I'm willing to negotiate with Bob to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my last offer and his offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to close the deal, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his counteroffer of $12,800 is too low. I'm not willing to drop that much further, and I'm confident that John will be happy to pay my minimum asking price."
