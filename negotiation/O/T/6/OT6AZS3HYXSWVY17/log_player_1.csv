Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go as high as $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really determined to get this product, so I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
