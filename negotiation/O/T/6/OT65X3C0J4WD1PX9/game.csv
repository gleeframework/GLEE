"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and do $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
