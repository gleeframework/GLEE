Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you a great product that I believe you will find valuable. I'm asking for $119.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120, so offering it at $119 gives him a small incentive to buy from you. This allows you to capture almost all the potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this specific scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John). Offering it at $119 to Bob ensures you don't lose the sale by aiming too high and getting rejected."
