"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
