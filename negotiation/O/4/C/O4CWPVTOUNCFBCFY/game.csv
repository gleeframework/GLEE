"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and is a fair offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $15,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and call it $14,500? That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,7,
