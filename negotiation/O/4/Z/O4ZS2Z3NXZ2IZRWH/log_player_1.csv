Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interest"" subtly encourages Bob to act quickly, potentially preventing him from lowballing you."
