Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation downward if Bob counters. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can still potentially reach a price above your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
