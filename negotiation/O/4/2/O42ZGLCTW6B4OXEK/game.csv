"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the special price, but $180 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us and lets me stay within my budget.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with it.",125.0,Alice,5,
