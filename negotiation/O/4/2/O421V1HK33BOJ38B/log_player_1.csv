Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  By emphasizing Bob's chance to buy ""before anyone else,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines.

By starting at $10,000, Alice gives herself the flexibility to:

* **Negotiate Down:**  If Bob pushes back, Alice can reduce the price slightly while still exceeding her minimum. 
* **Accept a Higher Offer:** Bob might even offer more than $10,000 if he's particularly interested.

This strategy maximizes Alice's chances of getting the best possible price for her product."
