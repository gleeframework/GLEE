Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This will give me a good starting point to see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I need to see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not willing to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but he's getting closer.  I want to see if I can push him to meet my price."

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  I want to keep the pressure on Bob and show him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give the product away."
