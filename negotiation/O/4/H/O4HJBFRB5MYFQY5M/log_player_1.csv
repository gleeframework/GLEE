Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can still potentially get a higher price, and if he accepts, I'll get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob at $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering his perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still too low.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
