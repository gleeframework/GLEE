Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to bite.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for the full $120 right away.  This allows for some back-and-forth and potential for a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:** The presence of John as a buyer at $120 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can make you an offer of $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I can still potentially get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate it,  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing that $110 is still a good deal for Bob, keeping him engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John for now:**  I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go above $100 for the product. Is there any chance we could meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm:**  Bob is unwilling to budge from his $100 offer.
* **My minimum:** My minimum price is $120, and Bob is unlikely to go higher.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is my minimum and a better price than what Bob is offering. 

It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John than risk further negotiation with Bob that is unlikely to lead to a satisfactory outcome."
