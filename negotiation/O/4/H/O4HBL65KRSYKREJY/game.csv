"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is my final offer for now.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll sell it to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
