"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $12,000. It's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than both Alice's value and my limit. There's room for negotiation."

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price closer to a fair middle ground while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $11,500 is still significantly higher than her value for the product. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, I think."",

This counteroffer splits the difference between the previous two offers. It shows a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on seeking a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice is firm at $12,000.  While this is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my psychological limit, and further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge the gap.  Buying from John at $15,000, while not ideal, ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of drawn-out negotiations with no guaranteed success."
