"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It makes no sense to buy from her at that price when you can get it from John for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer and moving to a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer of $18,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed price from John.  We can save $4,000 by purchasing from him."
