"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $105.  I'm confident that we can find a deal that works for both of us at that price.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below my original offer. How about we meet at $115? It's a slight compromise from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",115.0,Alice,5,
