"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer, but I want to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer because she is asking for $1,500,000 which is higher than the maximum price I am willing to pay. I will buy the product from John for $1,200,000 instead.
