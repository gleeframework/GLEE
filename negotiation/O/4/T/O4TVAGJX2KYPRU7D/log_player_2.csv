"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1200000.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay from John.  It's in my best interest to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which I believe still reflects the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $1,050,000 is a good deal for me, especially compared to John's price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away, and I'd be stuck with John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
