Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his range is. This offer also gives me the opportunity to gauge his interest and assess if I should continue negotiating with him or go with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit too low for me. Given its value, I'm willing to offer you $1300000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I want to see if we can find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand its value, $1,300,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is the lowest I can go. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1400000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $1350000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price and represents a good compromise.  I'm happy to accept and close the deal.  This is a good outcome given that I was initially asking for $1,000,000 and am now getting $1,350,000."
