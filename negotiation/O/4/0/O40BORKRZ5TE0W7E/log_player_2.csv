"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better price.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as I have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks interesting, but I'm not sure about that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a good deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget and gives me some room to negotiate.  It shows that I'm serious about buying the product but I also expect a better price."
