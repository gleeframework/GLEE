"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I think $10,000 is a bit too high for me, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I think the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'm willing to pay a bit more than half of that, but not as much as $10,000. Let's see...

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget."", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm not willing to pay $8,500, but I'm still interested in buying the product. Since Alice is not willing to go lower than $8,500, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's higher than $5,000 but lower than $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to find a middle ground. Since Alice is willing to go up to $8,500, I'll offer $7,000. This is still a good deal for me, and it's closer to the $8,000 value she has for the product.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $7,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. How about we split the difference at $7,500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
