"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to establish a high anchor. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price allows for flexibility and gives the impression of being willing to negotiate. 
* **Projecting Confidence:**  The language emphasizes the product's value, suggesting I believe it's worth the high price.

This strategy sets the stage for a negotiation where I can gradually lower the price while gauging Bob's interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for a product of this caliber, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.  Bob's willingness to go above his perceived value ($800,000) indicates strong interest. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your offer is appealing, I'm aiming for a figure closer to its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,100,000, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still staying above the halfway point between his offer and my initial price. This gives the impression of fairness and progress in the negotiation.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While moving closer to Bob's range, I'm still holding at a price significantly higher than his initial offer, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Time Consideration:** With several rounds remaining, this approach keeps the negotiation open, allowing for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe that's a fair compromise, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my backup option, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price in the next few rounds. The difference between his offer and John's is small enough to justify continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your commitment to finding common ground is appreciated. Let's bridge the gap â€“ how about $1,050,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your investment."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by a significant amount ($50,000), signaling flexibility and a desire to close the deal. 
* **Above the Guaranteed Offer:** This price still keeps me comfortably above John's $1,000,000 offer, preserving my safety net.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering a price slightly above the midpoint between our last offers allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm eager to finalize the deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but at this stage, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob prolongs the process and creates uncertainty. Accepting John's offer provides immediate closure and secures the desired profit.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a round I can't spend potentially finding another buyer who might offer even more than John.

While there's a slim chance Bob might eventually meet my desired price, the current situation favors accepting the guaranteed and immediate profit from John."
