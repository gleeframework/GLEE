Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $10,000, which gives me a starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the potential value for Bob, not just the price, to make the offer more appealing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  If Bob is a tough negotiator, he might outright reject this initial offer. I need to be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly in a counter-offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If I'm not in a rush, I might be willing to hold firm on the initial price. However, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John provides a safety net."
