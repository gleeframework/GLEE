"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to understanding your perspective as well.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you presented is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of the product. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues its true potential and the benefits it offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. If this product were to work for me, it would have to be closer to $700,000. That said, I'm very interested in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your interest in the product, but there's a significant gap between our positions.  I'm making a move to bridge that by offering it for $1,700,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a solution. However, I also need to be mindful of other opportunities. I need you to understand that this offer won't be on the table indefinitely.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the efforts you've made to find common ground. However, the current price point is still a significant stretch for me. I need to see a more substantial move to continue this conversation. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I have another opportunity I need to consider.",800000.0,Bob,6,
