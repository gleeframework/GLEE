"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
