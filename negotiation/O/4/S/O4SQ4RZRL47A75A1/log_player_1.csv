Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **Profit:** This price nets me $6,000, which is significantly better than the $8,000 I'd get from John.
* **Bob's Incentive:** Bob still gets a good deal, saving $1,000 on the product's worth to him. He's likely to accept this offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While there's a chance Bob might reject, it's less likely than if I offered a higher price."
