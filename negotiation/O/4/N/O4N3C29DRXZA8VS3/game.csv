"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to say that $900000 is a bit low considering the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's unique features and benefits.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still think the product is a bit overpriced. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a great value for the product's unique features and benefits.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer $980000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're making one last concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to meet you at $1020000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm counteroffering $990000. This is my absolute final offer.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, and I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, but I'm only willing to do this if you're willing to commit to a non-disclosure agreement and a 6-month exclusivity clause. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
