"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's, there's no advantage to buying from Alice. It's better to reject her offer and keep the option open to potentially negotiate with her or find another seller."
