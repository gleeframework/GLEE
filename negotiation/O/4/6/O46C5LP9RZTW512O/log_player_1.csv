Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $10,000, I leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob, making him feel more comfortable negotiating.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a good starting point for negotiation, $7,500 is below my minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I know I can sell to John for $8,000, which gives me leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price from $10,000 to $8,500. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:** $8,500 is still above my minimum price of $8,000, ensuring I don't sell the product for less than its worth.
* **Framing it Positively:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a fair deal, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,200 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:** Bob has already rejected two offers, demonstrating he's unwilling to go much higher. 
* **John provides a guaranteed price:**  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get a fair price for the product and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to meet my minimum requirements."
