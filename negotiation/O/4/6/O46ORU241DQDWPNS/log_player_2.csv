"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially getting a lower price.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as an alternative provides a safety net. If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still purchase the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** Alice's offer is a compromise, meeting us halfway. This is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.
* **Saving money:**  While still above the product's value to Alice, this price is significantly lower than her initial offer and within your budget.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to further rounds of negotiation, which may not result in a better price. There's also a risk that Alice might decide to withdraw the offer completely.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $1,350,000 seems like the most logical decision, balancing the need to save money with the risk of potentially losing the product altogether."
