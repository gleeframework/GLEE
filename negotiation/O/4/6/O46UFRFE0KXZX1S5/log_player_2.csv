"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

We can do better! While $9,500 isn't a terrible price, we know John will sell it for $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in further negotiations."
