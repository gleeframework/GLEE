Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120, slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate, but still leaves a good profit margin for me.  I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, and we can then engage in a negotiation to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price that's more fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's valuation while still allowing me to make a profit. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below the $100 I can get from John. I've already spent a few rounds negotiating with Bob, and I don't want to risk him continuing to counteroffer downwards.  It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
