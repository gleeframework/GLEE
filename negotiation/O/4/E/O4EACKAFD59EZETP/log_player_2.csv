# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice is offering $10,800, which is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and a better price than what John is offering. It's a good deal and worth accepting."
