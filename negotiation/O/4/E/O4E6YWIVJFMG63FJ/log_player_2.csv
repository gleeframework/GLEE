"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This price is still fair considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. I'm offering you the product for $11000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's offer of $12,000, and only slightly more than Bob's counteroffer of $10,500. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John and secures the product without further negotiation."
