"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than what I want, it's still close to my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I want to see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still above my minimum value and I believe it's a reasonable price considering Bob's initial counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower, and I'm not comfortable with that. I'm going to reject it again and try to get closer to my target price.  I still have a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Since Bob seems unwilling to budge much, I'm going to drop my price to my minimum value of $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unacceptable, and we are nearing the end of the rounds.  I don't want to risk going lower and getting a worse deal.  Selling to John at $8,000 is the best option for me at this point."
