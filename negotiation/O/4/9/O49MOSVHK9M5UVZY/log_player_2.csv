"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1800000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2

``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price well below my maximum. This will hopefully give us a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1000000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I need to continue negotiating to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product. This is a fair price and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but staying below my maximum.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward."
