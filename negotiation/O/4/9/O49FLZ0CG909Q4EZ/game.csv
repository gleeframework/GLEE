"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $700,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle on $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $825,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
