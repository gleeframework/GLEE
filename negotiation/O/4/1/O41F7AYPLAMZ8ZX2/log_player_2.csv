"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Offering $750,000 is a bold move, pushing Alice closer to Bob's budget. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in acquiring the product while also putting pressure on Alice to consider a more substantial reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above his target.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price closer to his preferred $800,000. He can either try to counteroffer again or wait to see if Alice will lower her price even further.  Buying from John is always a viable option, but Bob is still trying to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price. Offering $825,000 is a compromise, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway.  It's a reasonable price for both parties, and there's a good chance Alice will accept it. However, if Alice rejects this offer, Bob should seriously consider buying from John to avoid risking further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,500 is still slightly above Bob's limit. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers is increasing. It's likely that she will not budge much further, and Bob has already had a few rounds where his offers were rejected. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees the purchase within budget and minimizes risk."
