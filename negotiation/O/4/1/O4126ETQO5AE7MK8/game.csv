,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $105. How about $112.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $112.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  How about we split the difference?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $110. How about $111.25? It's a small step closer to your target, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",111.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence! However, $111.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108.  I hope we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $112.50, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $111.25 and $108. How about $109.625? It's a small compromise, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",109.625,Alice,7,
