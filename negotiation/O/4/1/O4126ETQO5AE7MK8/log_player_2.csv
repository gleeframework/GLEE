Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $105. How about $112.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $110. How about $111.25? It's a small step closer to your target, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.25

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.62
