"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:** The price is high enough that Bob has a strong incentive to counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  My minimum value for the product is $100. Bob's offer of $130 is above that, but I still have room to negotiate for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has expressed interest and is willing to negotiate, which indicates he values the product.  
* **Time Remaining:** I have 9 rounds left to explore a better price.

I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150 before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. How about $140? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reiterating that the product is great to reinforce its value in Bob's mind.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and friendly to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $135. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $130.
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, suggesting further negotiation may be unproductive. 
* **Time is a Factor:** I only have 6 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether. 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
