"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's offer and potentially negotiate a lower price from Alice or proceed with purchasing from John at the lower price."
