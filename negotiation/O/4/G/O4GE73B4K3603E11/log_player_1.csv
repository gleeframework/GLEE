Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,500,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's getting closer, but I'm not yet ready to accept. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $1,400,000 is my final offer.  It's a great price for a product that will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Please consider it a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum. I've made several concessions, but I'm not willing to go lower. I'd rather sell to John and secure my desired price."
