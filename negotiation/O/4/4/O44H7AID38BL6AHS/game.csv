"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1700000, which is still a fair price given the potential value. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1700000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1800000. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
