Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

This is a starting point. It's a significant markup from your minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to gauge Bob's reaction and adapt accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and it's not too far off my desired value. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
