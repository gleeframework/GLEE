"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and to leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product ($15,000).  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I still have time to negotiate and I don't want to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is still a good distance from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm also staying above my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a better price. I still have time and I'm hoping to close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum value. I'm happy to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
