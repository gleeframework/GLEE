Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still gives me a good profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a price that allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is still below what I would like, it's getting closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise and the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower offer or a deal falling through is too high."
