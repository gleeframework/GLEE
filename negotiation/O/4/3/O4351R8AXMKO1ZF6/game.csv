"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $8,750? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference at $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point.",8875.0,Alice,5,
