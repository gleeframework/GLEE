"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's important to try and get a higher price than $85 since John is willing to buy the product for $80.  The negotiation is still in early stages and there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that low yet. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go as low as $85, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is better than John's offer of $80, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $90.  Let's meet at $92.50 and call it a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $91.25, but that's as low as I can go. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $91.25. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  We're nearing the end of the rounds and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer increases."
