{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get closer to his perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
