Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $20,000 gives us room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  Mentioning we are ""open to negotiation"" encourages Bob to engage in a conversation.
* **Personal touch:**  Adding a friendly greeting and a compliment about the product helps build rapport. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** We'll learn from Bob's reaction whether he's interested and what his perceived value of the product is.
* **Adjust our strategy:** We can either stick to our price, counteroffer, or even choose to sell to John if Bob's offer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is our minimum:** We know the product is worth at least $15,000 to us, and Bob is offering that amount.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee we can get a higher price in further rounds, and we risk losing Bob entirely.
* **Time is valuable:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale. 

We can always try to sell to John for a higher price in the future if we have another similar product to offer."
