"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to keep your spending within budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a fair price for my product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Let's try $105. This way, we can both stay within our budgets.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to stick to my original request of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope you can accommodate this request.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I've already made several concessions. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $108. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I'm still aiming for $100. Considering the negotiation so far, I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us. I hope you can consider this final offer.",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made several concessions already, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I can sell the product to you for $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your patience throughout this process. I truly appreciate your efforts. Given the negotiation thus far, I would like to propose a final offer of $105. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.",105.0,Bob,10,
