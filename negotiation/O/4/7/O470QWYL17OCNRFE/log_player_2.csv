"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  I'm asking for $10,000 to start our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $10,000 is well above his budget.  It's best to reject the offer and start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing interest in the product, building a positive rapport. It then clearly states that Bob's budget is lower, offering a price that's significantly below Alice's initial offer. This is a substantial counteroffer that leaves room for negotiation while still aiming to secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000.  It's a good compromise, but Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little more than I can spend right now. I'm willing to go to $8,250. It's a fair price that's close to your last offer, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This counteroffer continues to move towards Alice's position, but still below her offer. It acknowledges her compromise and presents a price that's relatively close, increasing the chances of acceptance. The message emphasizes that Bob is ready to make a deal, putting pressure on Alice to close the negotiation."
