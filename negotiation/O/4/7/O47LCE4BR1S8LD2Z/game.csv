"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my financial situation, I can't commit to $1,075,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,060,000. This amount allows me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a fair return for your product. I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
