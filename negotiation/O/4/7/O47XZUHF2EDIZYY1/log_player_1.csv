Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed offer).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Since you have a guaranteed sale, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts strong, emphasizing the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a significant profit margin for you. It's below your guarantee but well above Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting ""significant returns"" subtly implies that even at this price, Bob will profit.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate within the ZOPA, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  While not explicitly stated in the message, knowing you have another buyer gives you leverage.  If negotiations stall, you can subtly remind Bob of this without revealing John's specific offer."
