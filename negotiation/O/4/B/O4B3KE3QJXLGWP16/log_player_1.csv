"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum threshold, and I'm happy to accept it.  This is a good outcome, as it allows me to sell the product without further negotiation and ensures I get my desired minimum value."
