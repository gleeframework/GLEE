"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $13,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal. He is offering a price that is lower than Alice's offer but still within his budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still rounds remaining, so it's worth trying to reach a deal that's even more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. He is demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement, but also making it clear that he's not willing to go any higher.  This could lead to a quick resolution as Alice is also looking to get $12,000."
