"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  It's a fair price that considers its value to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to drop to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's the best I can offer at this point. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,
