# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1200000. I understand that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your comfort zone and higher than what you offered. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price, especially since John offers the product for your maximum price."
