Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure the best price from Bob.

**Strategy**

The key is to aim high without being unreasonable.  A price that's too close to $1,500,000 might scare Bob away, but a low price leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""unique value proposition"" emphasize the product's desirability.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than your minimum but still leaves Bob with a potential gain of $150,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial price allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  While this offer is a good starting point, be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and any additional information you gather during the negotiation."
