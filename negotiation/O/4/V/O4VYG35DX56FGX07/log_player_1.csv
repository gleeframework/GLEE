Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $95. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. It's a compromise, but it's closer to my desired price and still below Bob's value of $80. Hopefully, this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my preferred price, it's above my minimum value of $80 and closer to the value Bob places on the product. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale entirely, so accepting his offer seems like the best strategy at this point."
