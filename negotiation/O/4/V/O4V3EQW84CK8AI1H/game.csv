"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a price below its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures we both get a good deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $950,000? This is the highest I can go, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to come up a little.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
