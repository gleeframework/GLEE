"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,900,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
