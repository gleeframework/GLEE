{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my guaranteed minimum of $800,000 from John.  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher price means a larger potential profit for me.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob is genuinely interested in the product and values it highly, he might be willing to pay the asking price. 
* **Minimize risk:** If Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value.

This strategy balances the desire for a higher price with the need to ensure a sale."
