"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1250000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1350000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
