"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that leaves us both with some profit."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Even though Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get closer to John's price before considering buying from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to your valuation, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $800,000. This price is closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer now matches John's price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John since the price is the same."
