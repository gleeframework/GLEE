,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that leaves us both with some profit.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to your valuation, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $800,000. This price is closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",800000.0,Alice,5,
