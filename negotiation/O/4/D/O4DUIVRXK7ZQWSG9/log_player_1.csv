{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's also lower than your minimum. This creates room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to consider the offer while still leaving you some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? It's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired profit."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and am comfortable moving forward with a counteroffer of $9,100. I believe this brings us closer to an agreement that respects both our financial positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit lower than my ideal, it's getting closer to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by rejecting again, and John's offer is only $900 more. It's time to accept and secure a profit."
