"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I'm not quite comfortable with your offer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you at $1025000, which is a $25000 discount from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $1000000, but I'm only willing to do this if you're willing to commit to purchasing the product immediately. If you're not ready to do that, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm not ready to commit to purchasing the product immediately at $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I need some time to think about it. Can we discuss the terms of the sale and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable deal?",980000.0,Bob,8,
