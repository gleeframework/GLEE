Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $92 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can convince Bob to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob is still unwilling to get close to my minimum price.  I'm running out of time, and John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
