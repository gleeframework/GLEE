"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below my minimum value and gives you a substantial profit margin. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering it leaves a good profit margin for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still gives you a substantial profit and is much closer to my minimum value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your minimum, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This offer is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too far below my minimum. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we settle at $925,000? This price is fair for both of us, as it is still well above your offer and closer to my minimum value. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it's a very fair price that still allows you a good profit.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $915,000? This is just a small step up from your offer and gets us closer to a final agreement.  I'm confident we can close this deal if we both show a little flexibility.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. Let's wrap this up - I can do $905,000. This is my final offer, as it's already a very competitive price for the product.",905000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $905,000 is a good offer, but I'm just a little shy of my target.  How about we settle at $910,000?  This would allow us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident this is the final price we can both agree on and close this deal.",910000.0,Alice,9,
