"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal target.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,500. This reflects the fair market value and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly above $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
