"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,500. This reflects the fair market value and gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly above $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
