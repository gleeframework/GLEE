Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, starting with a higher offer makes sense. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high demand and value, justifying the price.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How you proceed depends on Bob's response. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000)."
