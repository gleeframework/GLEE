Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $800,000 is significantly below what I consider to be a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm compensated for its true value.  I propose a price of $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.
