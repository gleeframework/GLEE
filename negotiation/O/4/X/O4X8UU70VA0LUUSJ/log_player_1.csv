Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I understand your budget constraints.  How about $12,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal, and while it's closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe we can find common ground. Could we discuss $12,000 as a potential price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge past $12,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a better outcome. Accepting John's offer avoids further risk and secures the minimum desired price."
