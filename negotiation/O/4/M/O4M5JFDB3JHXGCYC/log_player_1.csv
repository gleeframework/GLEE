Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is quite high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we consider a price closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be completely transparent, my absolute upper limit is $1,200,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum price ($1,200,000). This is less than what John is offering ($1,500,000). Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a better offer. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
