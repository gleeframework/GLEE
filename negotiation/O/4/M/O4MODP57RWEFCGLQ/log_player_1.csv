Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than $1,500,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  A starting price of $1,500,000 aims to capture as much of the potential surplus as possible.
* **Justification for the price:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. This allows you to potentially settle on a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial limits or how much he values the product beyond the given $1,200,000. If you had more information, you could tailor your approach for a potentially better outcome."
