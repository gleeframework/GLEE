Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000.  This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have a significant advantage knowing that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $925,000 allows you to capture a large portion of the value difference ($200,000) between your minimum price and Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Optional):** While this is a strong offer, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate a slightly lower price. However, the closer you get to $900,000, the less incentive Bob has to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, ensuring you won't lose money. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
