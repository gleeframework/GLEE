{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is still profitable for me, while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I've chosen to start a bit lower than my minimum price of $150, but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This strategy aims to incentivize Bob to negotiate while ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses down. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also lower than the initial offer I made. It's still worth exploring if I can get a better price from him, so I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe $120 is a fair price for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between? Perhaps $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd prefer to get. Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
