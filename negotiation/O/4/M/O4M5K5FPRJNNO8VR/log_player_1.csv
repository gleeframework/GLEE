""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Offering it slightly below this at $1,400,000 makes it highly appealing to him.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While John offers a safe $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob at $1,400,000 significantly increases your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential negotiation if he counters. This ensures you don't leave money on the table."
