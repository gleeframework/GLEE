"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable.  I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This product is really valuable, and I believe it will be worth the investment for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? I think that's a fair price.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,125? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great value for the product. What do you say?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $8,125 is still a touch high for me. Would you consider $7,900?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $7,900 is a good offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This is a really great product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,7,
