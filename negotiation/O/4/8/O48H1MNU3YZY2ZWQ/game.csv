"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $8,750? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is a win-win for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're eager to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,750 yet. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,200. This is a reasonable price considering the value the product brings to the table, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be honest, $9,200 is a little too close to my budget limit. I could stretch to $8,900.  Do you think we could make that work?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,900. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $9,150. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",9150.0,Alice,7,
