Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It also shows I value the product highly and am not afraid to ask for a good price.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll always have John as a backup to ensure I get at least $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm offering $1,900,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product at a higher price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting very close and it's likely we won't get a better deal. Accepting his offer guarantees me $1,850,000, which is significantly more than selling to John."
