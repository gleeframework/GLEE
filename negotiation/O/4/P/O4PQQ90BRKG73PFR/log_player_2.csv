"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product that I believe would significantly benefit you. Given its worth to you, I understand it's priced at $15,000. My proposal is to offer this exceptional item to you at a special price of $12,500. This represents a substantial saving for you and a fair deal for me. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $15,000.  You save $2,500 by accepting Alice's offer."
