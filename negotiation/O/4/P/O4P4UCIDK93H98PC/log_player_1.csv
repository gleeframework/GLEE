Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to perceive a ""good deal"" if he values it even slightly higher.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired price.  

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while keeping the guaranteed sale in mind."
