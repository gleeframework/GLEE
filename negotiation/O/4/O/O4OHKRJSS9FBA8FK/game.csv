"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for your consideration. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. My starting price is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer and come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go up to $1,087,500. That's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",1087500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,087,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and come down to $1,106,250. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1106250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,092,500, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider this offer, as I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating.",1092500.0,Bob,8,
