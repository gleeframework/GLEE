"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for your consideration. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. My starting price is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good starting point, but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for a better price. It's early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum of $800,000. I need to try and push for a better price before considering selling to John. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer and come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go up to $1,087,500. That's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I am more than happy to sell to John for $800,000, but I would prefer to continue negotiating with Bob. I am confident that I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,087,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and come down to $1,106,250. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1106250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,092,500, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider this offer, as I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,092,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,092,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 8. While Bob's latest offer is close to my minimum, it's still not quite enough for me to feel like I'm getting a good deal. It's also clear that we are getting close to a stalemate, and further negotiation might not yield a much better price. 

Considering that I have a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John, it's wiser to accept that deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with John by continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
