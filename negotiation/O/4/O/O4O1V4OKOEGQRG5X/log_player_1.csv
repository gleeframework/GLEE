"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a sense of potential savings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a compromise closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves you a good margin for profit. Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is your minimum acceptable price, and it's a fair deal considering the value of the product to him.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
