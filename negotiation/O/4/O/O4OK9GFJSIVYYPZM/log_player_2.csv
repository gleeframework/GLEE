"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you can buy the product from John for the same price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. It's possible that Alice values the product less than $1,000,000, and you could potentially negotiate a lower price with her."
