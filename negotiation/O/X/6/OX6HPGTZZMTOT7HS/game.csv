"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you.  Based on its potential, I'm asking for $1000000. I'm confident you'll see the value in it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product like this, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900000.  This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down slightly, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're proposing the product has. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,
