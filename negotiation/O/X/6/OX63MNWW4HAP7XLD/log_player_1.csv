"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to get the best possible deal. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefit to Bob, emphasizing that it's a ""great deal"" for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially adjusting the price.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and aim to maximize my profits while ensuring a deal is made within the 10 rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can get a better price. 
* **Keeping options open:** Selling to John is always a backup option, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially securing a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, considering Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm on minimum:**  I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer while still giving me a profit.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to persuade him to accept my counteroffer.

**Strategy:** By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my price in future rounds, keeping in mind the value of the product and my fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This is still within my budget, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While his offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I want to explore if we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:** The option to sell to John for $15,000 is still available, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to find a price point that's more appealing to me, keeping in mind Bob's willingness to negotiate and the value of the product to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and I appreciate you coming up in your offer. $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you consider $11,500? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm trying to find a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" nature of the proposed deal, appealing to Bob's desire for a fair outcome.
* **Remaining firm:**  I'm still not willing to go below $11,500, as it's crucial to maintain a decent profit margin.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a final deal in this round. If Bob accepts, I get a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my options, weighing the potential of further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll increase my offer to $11,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and stays within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to target:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is just $500 below my desired profit margin.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that I won't get a better offer.  
* **Time constraint:**  We are already in Round 6, and I need to consider the diminishing rounds remaining.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale without risking further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome.  It's a good balance of profit and time management."
