It's always worth trying to negotiate.  You can see if Alice is willing to come down in price before committing to buying from John."

Alice is still above my preferred price, and there are still more rounds available. I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying significantly below Alice's last offer.  I want to show her that I'm serious about buying, but I'm also not going to pay a price I don't think is fair."
