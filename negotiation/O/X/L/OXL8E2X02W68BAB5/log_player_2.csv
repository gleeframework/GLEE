"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by making a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth process, allowing Bob to potentially secure a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $8,500, which is closer to Bob's budget, but still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Since he's aiming for the lowest price possible, it's still better to reject and try to negotiate further. The price from John is still a viable option if Bob can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. This is a fair compromise that respects both of our needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but still trying to get the best possible price. By offering $8,200, he's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while keeping his goal of staying under $8,000 in mind. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and close the deal or risk losing the sale to John."
