I'm excited to offer you this great product for a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180.,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $180 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for this product. Would you be open to that?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit low for me. I can do $160, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This is the absolute most I can afford.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $145, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",145.0,Alice,7,
