 Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but if she won't budge, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160. How about $140?

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still above your $80 limit. It's worth trying one last counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $80.  You've tried your best to negotiate with Alice, but she's not willing to budge any further."
