Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.**  It's more than my minimum ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to get a good deal.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob.** This makes it more likely he'll consider the offer seriously. 
* **I'm prepared to potentially negotiate.**  I'm not setting a hardline price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if he feels it's too high. However, I'm also aware of John's offer as a backup, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can get more by continuing negotiations with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  Would you consider $10,500? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price that's closer to my desired price:** I'm moving closer to my initial offer of $12,000 but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize the ""great deal"" for Bob:** This reminds him of the value he'll gain by buying the product.
* **Use a positive and friendly tone:** I want to keep the negotiations amicable and open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $9,500, which is just $500 less than my last offer.  This is a good deal for me, considering that John is only offering $8,000. It's time to close the deal and secure a profitable sale."
