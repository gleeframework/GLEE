"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** You can get the product for $950,000 from Alice, which is cheaper than John's $1,000,000.
* **You can try to negotiate further:**  Since Alice wants to sell for $800,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."
