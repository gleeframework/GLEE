"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close. I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go up to $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
