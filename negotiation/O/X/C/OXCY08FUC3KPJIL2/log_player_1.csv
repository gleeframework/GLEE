"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. I'm also framing it positively, emphasizing the value and opportunity for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is still a decent price, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price through further negotiation, especially since Bob has already expressed his interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```
I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable value of $8,000 but offering a slight compromise at $8,500. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Would you be willing to sell the product at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
