"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. How about we settle on $800,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $800,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's settle this â€“ I'm willing to offer $900,000.  That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant concession, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $950,000? That's a strong offer, and it shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I understand that $950,000 is a strong offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm confident that the product's value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm not willing to sacrifice that much of its value. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
