"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102?  That's still a good deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 is a big jump. How about we meet in the middle at $96? That's a fair compromise.",96.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $96 is still too far off. Let's try $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
