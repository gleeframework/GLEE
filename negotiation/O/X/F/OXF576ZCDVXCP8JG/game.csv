"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $12,500 is closer to my budget, but I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This would give us both a good deal and let us finalize the sale.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,
