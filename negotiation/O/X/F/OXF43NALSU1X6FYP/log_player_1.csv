Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $12,000.
* **Considering the Alternative:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
