"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $115? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is still a good deal compared to John's price of $150. It's a reasonable compromise, and you're likely to save a significant amount of money by accepting the offer. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it's not guaranteed, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
