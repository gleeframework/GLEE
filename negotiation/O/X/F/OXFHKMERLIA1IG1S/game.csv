,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $70. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $82? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $75 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet at $79? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting close to my minimum price.",79.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I still think $79 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $76, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",76.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $76 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $78? It's a fair price, considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception for you.",78.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, but I'm afraid I've already made my final offer at $76. I'm willing to buy the product at this price, so please let me know if you can meet me there.",76.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you've made your final offer at $76, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm going to make one more offer, and if you don't accept, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else. How about we meet at $78.50? It's the highest price I'm willing to offer, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",78.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away from the deal, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product. I'm willing to make a final offer of $76, and that's the lowest price I'm willing to pay. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",76.0,Bob,10,
