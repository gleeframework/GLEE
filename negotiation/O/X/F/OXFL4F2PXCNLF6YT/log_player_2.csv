"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12000 to us. Considering its worth to you, I propose a starting price of $9500. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum budget and offering a price that's still a good deal for Alice, considering her valuation. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me make you an offer of $9800 for our premium product. I hope this meets within your desired range and allows you to make the most of this valuable opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, her offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a little too high.  How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum budget of $10,000. He is offering a price that is in the middle of his budget and Alice's previous offer.  This is a reasonable compromise and might be appealing to Alice since it's closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your feedback, Bob, I am willing to offer our premium product at $9700. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,700 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a decision. At this point, it is better for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees a purchase within his budget, and he doesn't risk losing out on the product by continuing negotiations with Alice."
