"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let you have it for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000 and higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). This means it's a good deal for both of you.  Accepting her offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John."
