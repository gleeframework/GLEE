# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your specific needs. This product, with its cutting-edge features and unparalleled quality, is truly a game-changer in its field. Given its exceptional value and capabilities, we believe it would be an invaluable addition to your collection. Considering its market value and the benefits it offers, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $10,000. This is a significant discount compared to the retail price, making it a fantastic deal for someone like you who appreciates both quality and value. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details about the product. We're confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is enticing, $10,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your budget, or you can proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
