Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, making the price more palatable.

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While ideal, it's risky.  Bob might be turned off by what he perceives as an attempt to take all the profit. A slightly lower price increases the chances of a successful deal."
