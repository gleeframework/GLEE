Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $750,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $787,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $792,375. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $792,375.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $792,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price point. With only three rounds left, it's becoming increasingly difficult to push for a lower price. It's better to buy the product from John at $800,000, which is within your budget, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially missing out on a good deal."
