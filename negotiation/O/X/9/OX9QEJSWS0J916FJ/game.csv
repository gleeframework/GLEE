"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and offers unparalleled value. Given its exceptional features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than what it costs us, but we're looking to make this transaction beneficial for both parties. Considering its high value to you and the market, I propose to sell the product to you for $14000. This price not only ensures a fair profit for us but also allows you to acquire a valuable asset at an attractive rate. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations.",14000.0,Alice,1,
