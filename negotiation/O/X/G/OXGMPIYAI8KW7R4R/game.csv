"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while I still get a decent return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a substantial profit and would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
