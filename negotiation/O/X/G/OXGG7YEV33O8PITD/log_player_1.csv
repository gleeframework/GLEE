Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving and generating significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more if he perceives it as a unique opportunity or something essential to his needs.
* **Negotiation Room:** The initial high price provides room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then potentially settle on a price still significantly higher than your guaranteed sale price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the flexibility to walk away from a deal with Bob if he's unwilling to meet a price that's significantly above your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
