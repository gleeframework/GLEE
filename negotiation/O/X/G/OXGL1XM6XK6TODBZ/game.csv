"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price to make this a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both room to benefit from this transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low considering the true value this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects my effort in securing this product and ensures a fair profit for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land on a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm offering $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a smooth transaction for both of us. ",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the very bottom line for a product of this caliber.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
