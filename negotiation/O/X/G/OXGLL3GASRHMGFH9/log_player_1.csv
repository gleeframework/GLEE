Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This price would still allow you to make a profit and would be a good deal for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
