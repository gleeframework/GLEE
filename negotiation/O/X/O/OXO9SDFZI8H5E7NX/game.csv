,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for you and gives us both a fair price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
