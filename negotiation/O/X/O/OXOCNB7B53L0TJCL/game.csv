"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm a savvy buyer, and I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're a savvy buyer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500?  That leaves plenty of room for you to still get a great deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Bob,4,
