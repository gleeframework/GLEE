"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $750,000 for the product?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I'll consider the $850,000 offer, but let me propose $800,000. It's still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to negotiate further if possible.",800000.0,Bob,4,
