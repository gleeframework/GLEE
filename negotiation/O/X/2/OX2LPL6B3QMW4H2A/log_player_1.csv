Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price.  I'm confident that Bob will either accept, or we can negotiate.  If he rejects, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $850,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a significant compromise from my original asking price, but it's still within the range of what I believe is fair, given Bob's valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $900,000 is a significant improvement over his initial offer and brings me closer to my desired outcome.  It's also a better deal than selling to John, as I'll be able to close this deal faster."
