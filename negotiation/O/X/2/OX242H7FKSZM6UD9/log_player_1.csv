Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is just too low for me.  How about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $15,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering we only have 6 rounds left.  It's also higher than what John is offering.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or having to negotiate further with Bob and potentially getting a lower price."
