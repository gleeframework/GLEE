Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my highest offer so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower. It's better to try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, which still reflects the true value of this product. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. This is my final offer for now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000, which is a significant compromise. I believe this is fair considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but no higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already had several rounds of negotiations, and it seems like we are unlikely to reach an agreement.  I'm better off selling to John for my desired price."
