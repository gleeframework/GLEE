"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
