"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response!",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's close this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
