"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer for the product is $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've got to think about my own bottom line. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $11,250. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's make this happen.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I've already met you halfway and compromised on the price. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm still open to finding a deal. Let's try $11,375. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product.",11375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,375 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach a deal at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $11,000. I've already told you that my minimum price is $11,500, and I'm not willing to go below that. I'm starting to think that we're not going to reach a deal, and I'll have to consider other options. However, I'm still open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try $11,250 again. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",11250.0,Alice,9,
