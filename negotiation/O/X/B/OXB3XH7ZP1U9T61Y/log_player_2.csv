Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $80.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80.5

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $80.50, and it's a reasonable price compared to your $100 alternative with John.  This secures the product at a significant discount."
