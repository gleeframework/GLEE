"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1350000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
