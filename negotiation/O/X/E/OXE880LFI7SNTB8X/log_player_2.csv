"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring options before committing to a price.  Since Alice's initial offer is your maximum, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting allows you to see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $200,000 reduction is a substantial amount, showing I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down $100,000 from her initial offer, and I'm now at a price that's $100,000 below my maximum.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  While I could potentially get a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or me running out of rounds is too high."
