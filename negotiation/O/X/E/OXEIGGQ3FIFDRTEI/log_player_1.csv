Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested. This keeps the door open for a slightly higher sale price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the full $120 might make Bob immediately decline. There's a chance he'd be willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value ($100) but not the absolute maximum."
