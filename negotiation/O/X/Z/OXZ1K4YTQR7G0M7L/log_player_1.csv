"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but not too high that it's immediately unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counter-offers. It also shows I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $85 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than my floor price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiating, I can't go lower than $90.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting as close to $100 as possible.  While I've lowered my offer, it's still above my minimum.  I'm hopeful that Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Let's try $87. It's a bit closer to what I was hoping for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go down to $89 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer.  This shows him that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hopeful that he will accept this counteroffer."
