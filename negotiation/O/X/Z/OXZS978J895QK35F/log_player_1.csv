Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Politeness:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't know the value to Bob, I'm suggesting it's a product he might be interested in.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider lowering the price, understanding his counteroffer, or even moving on to John if the negotiation seems unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further risks losing time and potentially not getting a better offer.
* **Certainty:** Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob ultimately rejecting further offers.

**Conclusion:**  It's best to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid any further uncertainty."
