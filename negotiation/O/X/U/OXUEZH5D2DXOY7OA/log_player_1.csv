Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'll offer you the product for $12,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take it, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. We're only two rounds away from having to sell to John, so I'm going to risk it and try to get a better deal."

Bob's offer:

This is a tough one. Bob's offer is pretty close to what I'd get from John.  However, we are out of rounds and I don't want to risk not getting any deal at all. So, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John."
