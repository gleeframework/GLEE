Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $88, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88 and $92, so I'll offer you $90. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is $90, which is better than buying from John for $100. While you ideally would like to pay less, you've reached a decent price. There's a risk that rejecting this offer could lead to a stalemate, and you'll be forced to buy from John.  It's a good compromise and a reasonable deal."
