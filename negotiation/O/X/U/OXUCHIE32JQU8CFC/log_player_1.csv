Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,700,000 for the product. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering its value. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I want, it's still not enough to meet my minimum goal. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round, but if I don't see a significant improvement, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $1,400,000 still falls short of what I need. To make this work, I need to get at least $1,600,000.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and this price reflects its true worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product, which is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one.  While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum goal, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident that he'll go any higher.  John is a sure thing at that price, and I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiations with Bob.  I'm going to sell to John."
