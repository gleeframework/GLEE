{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I open the offer to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could sell the product to John for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning other interested parties, we create a sense of urgency without being too pushy.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of closing a deal with Bob."
