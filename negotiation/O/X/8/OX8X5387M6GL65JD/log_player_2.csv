It's better to reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is over your budget. You can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John as a backup."

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it sets a strong baseline for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. I'm hoping Alice will see the value of the product to you and be willing to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price.  John's offer is a good safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal from Alice.  I'll counteroffer again."

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing that I am willing to negotiate.  It's still below John's offer, so I have some room to maneuver, but it's also a price that I think is fair."
