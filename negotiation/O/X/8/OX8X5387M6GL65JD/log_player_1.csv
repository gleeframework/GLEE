Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and also signals the high value I place on the product.  I'm confident I can get a better price than selling to John, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's not the price I want for this product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly closer to my desired price than his previous offer, and it's also higher than what John is offering. I'm going to accept his offer."
