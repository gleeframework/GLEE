{""product_price"": 200}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $200. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I still make a profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a risk by offering a price above my minimum. But I'm hoping that Bob finds the product valuable enough to pay this price. If he rejects the offer, I'll still be able to sell the product to John for $150."
