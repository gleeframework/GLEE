"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the value you've placed on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is my absolute floor, I'm confident the value this product brings to you is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $950,000, and you're now offering $900,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair middle ground that takes into account the value you've placed on the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
