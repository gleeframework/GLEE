{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, while leaving room for potential counteroffers from Bob.  I'm hoping to find a price point that maximizes my profit while still appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a tempting offer, I am not willing to settle for that price yet.  Bob's counteroffer indicates that he is willing to pay more than his initial offer, and there is still room for negotiation. I will counter with a higher price to try and maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves a good margin for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $10,500. It's a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even selling to John for $8,000."
