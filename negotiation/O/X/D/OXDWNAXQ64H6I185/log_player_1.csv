Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and inviting, suggesting I'm open to negotiation. This increases the chances of Bob accepting or making a counteroffer.
* **Protecting My Interests:** If Bob rejects, I have the option to go to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Even though Bob is interested, I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.  
* **John is a Safe Backup:** If negotiations with Bob break down, I can still sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $110 was a bit high.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum price.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $105 is still a good price for me, considering the product's value to me and the possibility of selling to John for $120.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains friendly and open to negotiation, increasing the chances of Bob accepting or making another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm trying to be fair, but I really think that's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value and I'm already in a position to secure $120 from John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, wasting time and potentially losing out on the $120 deal with John.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed outcome and maximizes my profit."
