"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still better than buying from John for $150.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept the offer and save $10 compared to buying from John."
