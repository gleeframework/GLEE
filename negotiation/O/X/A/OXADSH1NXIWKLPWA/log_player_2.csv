Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $500,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $700,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $650,000 is pushing my budget.  Would you consider $625,000?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 625000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $625,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one! Alice is clearly holding firm, and while there's theoretically room to negotiate down further, it's getting riskier. Here's why accepting at $675,000 makes sense:

* **Significant Savings:**  You're still saving $325,000 compared to John's price.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now secures the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to push lower (e.g., $637,500) might backfire, and Alice seems unlikely to move much more. 

It's a judgment call, but at this point, the risk of losing the deal and paying John's full price outweighs the potential savings from a few more rounds."
