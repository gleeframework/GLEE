"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is impressive, I believe a price of $500,000 would be more reflective of its market value. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $500,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $700,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise.  How about $600,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $650,000 is pushing my budget.  Would you consider $625,000?  That's my final offer.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $625,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",675000.0,Alice,7,
