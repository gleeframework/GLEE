{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. This price still reflects the product's value and gives you a significant advantage.  Let's meet halfway and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate for a deal and have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counteroffer again, trying to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects the value you place on the product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is simply too low. I've already made significant concessions, and it's clear we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John. I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
