Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the value the product offers. This is a good tactic to make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  I don't mention selling to John, as this might make Bob less likely to negotiate. 

I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing me to assess his willingness to pay and determine if I should continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Value to John:**  I'm not desperate to sell, as I have a backup option with John offering $100. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that hopefully bridges the gap and leads to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! While $90 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $95, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and why $95 is a fair price. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is still positive, keeping the negotiation friendly and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. 

By offering $95, I'm hoping to strike a deal while ensuring a profit for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to make a final concession or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $95 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $90. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $95, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Value to John:** Selling to John for $100 is an option, but Bob's offer is only $7.50 less, making it a worthwhile deal.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's close to my target and avoids the risk of a long negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
