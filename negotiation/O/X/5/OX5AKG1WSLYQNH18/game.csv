"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! While $90 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",95.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $95 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. Can you consider that?,92.5,Bob,4,
