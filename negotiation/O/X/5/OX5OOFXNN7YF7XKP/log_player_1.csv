Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, I'll aim to get a good price for it. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 20,000}

I'm hoping Bob will find this offer reasonable, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $15,000. Since this is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
