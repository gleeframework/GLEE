"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product can incentivize Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, keeping the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum value of $10,000, I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John would guarantee $10,000, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $8,800 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,150?  This allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but maintaining a friendly tone and showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Midpoint Offer:**  Offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer shows a genuine attempt to find a compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the ""fair deal"" aspect can make Bob feel like he's getting a good value while ensuring I get a better price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $8,900 for the product? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I've managed to raise the price slightly through negotiation, and I believe there's still room for improvement.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $10,000, I'm confident I can secure a higher price from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, demonstrating flexibility but still keeping the price above Bob's last offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Not Enough:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and while it's getting closer, I'm not willing to accept a price that low.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are halfway through the negotiation, and I need to make sure I secure a good price. 
* **John's Offer:** While I prefer to close a deal with Bob, selling to John guarantees $10,000, and it might be worth considering if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,950 is still not quite where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle on $9,050? This is a small step closer to my last offer and allows us to finalize a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9050}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount ($50), showing flexibility while still moving the negotiation in my favor.
* **Focus on Finalizing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the ""finalize a deal"" aspect to motivate Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to avoid a breakdown in negotiations. 
* **Weighing Options:**  While selling to John is still an option, I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,050 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $8,975 for the product? I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,975. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,975
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We have only two rounds left. I need to be strategic and ensure I get a price that meets my minimum requirement.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John at $10,000 becomes a more attractive option, considering the limited negotiation rounds remaining and the risk of Bob not meeting my price.  

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and see if I can secure a higher price in the final two rounds. If not, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $8,975 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Since we only have one round left, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $9,025. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the remaining negotiation time. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9025}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer, leaving no room for further negotiation in the last round.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility but staying firm on a price that's above my minimum.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining to motivate Bob to accept the offer.
* **Alternative Options:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options (John) if he doesn't accept.
* **Fairness:**  I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by highlighting the value of the product and the remaining time.

This approach is designed to create a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept the offer, while still leaving a small window for negotiation if he's truly willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more offer. How about $8,975 for the product? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,975.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.
* **Guaranteed Price:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which meets my minimum requirement and ensures I don't lose out on a better deal.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Despite my efforts, Bob has consistently offered prices below my minimum, indicating that a mutually agreeable price is unlikely.

With limited time remaining and no guarantee of a better offer, I'm choosing to secure a guaranteed $10,000 by selling to John."
