"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob knows he can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so he has leverage to try for a lower price from Alice."
