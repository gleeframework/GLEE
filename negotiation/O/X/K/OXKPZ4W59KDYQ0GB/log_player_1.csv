Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,100,000 still provides a $300,000 profit over selling to John.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism, aiming for the best possible outcome while acknowledging Bob's power in the negotiation."
