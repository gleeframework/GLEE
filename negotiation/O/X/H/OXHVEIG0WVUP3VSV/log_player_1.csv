Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is a bit out of my price range at the moment, I would be willing to pay $700,000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are too far below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that makes continuing the negotiation worthwhile. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids further haggling."
