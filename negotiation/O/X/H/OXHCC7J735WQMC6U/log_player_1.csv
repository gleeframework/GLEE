"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, framing it as an ""opportunity"" and emphasizing the ""value and potential"" aims to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer seriously.
* **Open Communication:** I'm encouraging a dialogue with ""What are your thoughts?"" This invites Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than simply accepting or rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $800,000 range. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his counter is low, it shows he's interested. I'll counter to steer the negotiation toward a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement and Compromise:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing understanding. This maintains a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that his offer is too low but am doing so without being confrontational. I'm using the phrase ""to find a middle ground"" to show willingness to move from my initial price. 
* **Significant Drop:** My counteroffer is a $200,000 decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating significant movement towards Bob's range.  
* **Holding Firm:**  While I'm compromising, the new price is still significantly above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer, providing room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can do $900,000.  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer, but only by $100,000. At this pace, we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  The offer is still significantly below my minimum, and I have the security of John's offer.  

I'll reject to signal that this offer isn't acceptable, but I need to be prepared to make a more substantial move in the next round if I want to keep Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I'm motivated to find an agreement with you on this. To show that, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** I'm making a substantial drop ($150,000) to signal my seriousness about closing the deal and incentivize Bob to do the same.
* **Approaching Limit:**  This price is getting very close to my absolute minimum.  Bob needs to understand I'm making a significant compromise.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  By highlighting this as a ""fair deal"" I'm aiming to shift the negotiation from a back-and-forth to a point where we can both agree on the value. 
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to apply a little more pressure to reach a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a loss compared to selling to John.
* **Potential for More:** While Bob is suggesting a ""middle ground,"" he hasn't moved significantly from his previous offers. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher, especially as we approach the later rounds.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if he doesn't improve his offer significantly. 
 
By rejecting, I'm placing the pressure back on Bob to make a more serious move towards my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working to find common ground. However, to be completely transparent,  $1,075,000 is cutting it too close. My absolute lowest price is $1,190,000. This offer takes into account our discussions and represents the final price I'm willing to accept."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Finality:** I'm being completely transparent with Bob about my minimum acceptable price. This leaves no room for misinterpretation and shows I'm serious. 
* **Justified Concession:** I've lowered my price slightly to $1,190,000.  This demonstrates movement but keeps me above my absolute floor while leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:** By stating this is my ""final price,"" I'm introducing a strong sense of urgency. Bob knows this is his last chance to secure the product from me.
* **Walk Away Leverage:** I'm prepared to walk away and take John's offer if Bob doesn't accept. This firm stance strengthens my negotiating position."
