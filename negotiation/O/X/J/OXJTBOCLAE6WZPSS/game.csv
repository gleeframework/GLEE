"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me.  While $700,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
