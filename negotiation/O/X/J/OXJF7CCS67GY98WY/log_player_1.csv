Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still only able to go up to $110. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.

Bob is holding firm to his much lower budget, and it seems unlikely he'll move significantly higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
