"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and my previous offer of $160. How about $130?",130.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about $145? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,7,,
