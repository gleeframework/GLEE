"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still allows for a fair profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for something in the middle.  Would you consider $850,000?  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while being within a reasonable range for both of us.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so it makes more sense to take the sure deal and avoid further negotiation."
