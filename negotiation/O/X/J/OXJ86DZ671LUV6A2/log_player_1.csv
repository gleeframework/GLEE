{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I understand its value to you, and I'm willing to be flexible on the price. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it allows room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, aiming to build rapport with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob is serious, he will likely counteroffer. If he immediately rejects, it's a sign he's not a serious buyer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, giving me room to negotiate down while still achieving a profit significantly above my minimum. 
* **Set the tone for a collaborative negotiation:** By being friendly and open, I hope to encourage Bob to reciprocate and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he counters with a price that is reasonable and closer to my target, I'll likely counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap. If he rejects my initial offer with a very low counteroffer, I'll need to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if I should move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible.  However, I have a budget in mind for this purchase, and your starting price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:**  Selling at $600,000 would mean losing almost $900,000 from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum,  but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This will allow me to test Bob's seriousness and gauge his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still allows for a fair profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, emphasizing that my minimum acceptable price is higher than his offer. It also highlights my willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Signal seriousness:** By offering a lower price than my initial offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  If Bob is genuinely interested, he's likely to counteroffer again, potentially with a price closer to $900,000.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate further if needed.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response. If he counteroffers with a price that is closer to my target, I will be willing to negotiate further.  If he rejects my offer again with a price too low, I will have to decide if I should continue negotiating with him or if I should move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:**  Selling at $750,000 would mean losing over $750,000 from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum,  but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This will allow me to test Bob's seriousness and gauge his willingness to compromise."

```

**Explanation:**
