"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is there any flexibility in your price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit below my minimum. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's unique features and benefits.",825000.0,Alice,3,
