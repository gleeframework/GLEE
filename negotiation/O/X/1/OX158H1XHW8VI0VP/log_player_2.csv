"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,150,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and a better deal than buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a good price without the risk of losing it to John."
