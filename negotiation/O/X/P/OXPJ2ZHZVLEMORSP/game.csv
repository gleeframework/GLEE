"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, as you've said the product is worth more to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",9250.0,Alice,3,
