Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth a lot more to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $10,000 is less than the $12,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you have room to move up a bit without going too close to his value. 

Keep in mind, you have the option to sell to John for $8,000 at any time if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below what I'd ideally want.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, as you've said the product is worth more to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9250}
