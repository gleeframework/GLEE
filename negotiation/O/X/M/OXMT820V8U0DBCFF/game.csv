"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me this product. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $14,000, but I have to say, that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While it's a nice product, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the negotiation, Bob, but $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
