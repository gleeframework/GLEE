"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for you as well.  My initial offer is $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product offers, I believe $975,000 is a fair price that benefits us both.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it allows me to ensure a worthwhile return on my investment.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
