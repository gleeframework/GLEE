Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off right away. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$130 is closer to my minimum but still below what I hope to get. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $135 isn't my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly higher than what John is offering.  I'd rather secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk further negotiation or getting stuck with John's lower offer."
