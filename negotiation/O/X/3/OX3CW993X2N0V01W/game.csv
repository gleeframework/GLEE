"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $147.50. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",147.5,Alice,5,
