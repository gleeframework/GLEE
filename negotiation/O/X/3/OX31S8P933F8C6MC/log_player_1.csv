``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still aims to get a higher price than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price in further negotiations. It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
