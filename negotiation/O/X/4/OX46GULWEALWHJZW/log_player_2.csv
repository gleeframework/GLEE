"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident you'll find its value to be well worth the investment.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the potential for significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be valuable for my business, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, and my counteroffer is $1,000,000. This price still leaves room for a strong return on your investment while allowing me to ensure a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is down to her lowest acceptable price. There's no benefit to going to John now, as his offer is the same.  Accepting Alice's offer closes the deal."
