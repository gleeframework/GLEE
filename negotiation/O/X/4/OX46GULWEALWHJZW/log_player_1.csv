"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be valuable for my business, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

This price still leaves room for a strong return on your investment while allowing me to ensure a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
