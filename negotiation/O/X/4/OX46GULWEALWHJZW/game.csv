"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be valuable for my business, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, and my counteroffer is $1,000,000. This price still leaves room for a strong return on your investment while allowing me to ensure a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
