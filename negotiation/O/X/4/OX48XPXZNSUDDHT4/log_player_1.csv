"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $13,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
