"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $13,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
