"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
