Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" it might make Bob feel more inclined to accept before he misses out.
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and concise about the asking price, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob and your negotiation style, you might choose a different approach."
