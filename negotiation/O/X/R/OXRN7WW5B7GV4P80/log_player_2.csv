Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,750,000? This reflects my product's true value while recognizing your interest.

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $1,000,000.  However, it's getting closer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target.  Buying from John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice first."
