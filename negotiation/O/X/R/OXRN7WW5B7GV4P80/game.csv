"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the price further.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,750,000? This reflects my product's true value while recognizing your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  I believe this price is fair given the product's value to me, and it allows both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is my final offer.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would be a good middle ground, allowing both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
