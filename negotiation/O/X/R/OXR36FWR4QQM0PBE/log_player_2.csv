**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $775,000. While she might be willing to come down another $25,000, it's not worth the risk of her digging in and the negotiation stalling. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is only slightly higher than Alice's current offer. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now than risk the negotiations failing and potentially missing out."
