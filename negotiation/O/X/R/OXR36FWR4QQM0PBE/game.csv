"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potentials, but I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think it's a little high. Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",775000.0,Alice,5,
