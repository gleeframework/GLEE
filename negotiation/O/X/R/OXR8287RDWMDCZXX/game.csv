"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still be a great deal for you, allowing you to acquire the product for less than its worth to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
