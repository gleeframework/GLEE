Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999. I think you'll find it provides excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 11999}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, which is what John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000 allows Alice to set a price significantly higher. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's really interested.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
