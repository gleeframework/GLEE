Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate.  It's also not an outrageous price, so it's more likely to be considered by Bob.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get more. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and signals a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum value.  Since I can sell to John for my minimum, it's more advantageous to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
