"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product and my upper limit. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $70, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($80).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer gives Alice room to counter, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for you considering the value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to her actual value for the product, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her halfway between her current offer and my previous one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $77, I'm proposing a price directly in between her last offer ($85) and my previous counteroffer ($70). 
* **Seeking Agreement:**  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  The tone remains amicable and solution-oriented."
