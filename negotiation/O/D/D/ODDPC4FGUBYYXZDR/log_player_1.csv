"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,250,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better deal, even if it means going a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob, making him see the value in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm running out of time. I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob may walk away and I'll be left with only John's offer, which is my minimum.  Taking the $1,450,000 is a good deal, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
