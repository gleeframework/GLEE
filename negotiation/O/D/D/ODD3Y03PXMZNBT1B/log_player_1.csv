Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $18,000, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground.  At this point, the difference between his offer ($17,000) and my desired price is becoming smaller. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further, or me having to settle for John's $15,000 offer in a later round."
