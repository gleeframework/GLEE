"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I know will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the immense potential it holds. Let's start this negotiation off strong!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I see the value in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this deal done!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal!",1275000.0,Alice,5,
