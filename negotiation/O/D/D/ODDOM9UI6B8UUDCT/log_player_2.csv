Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I know will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the immense potential it holds. Let's start this negotiation off strong!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly and is now very close to the midpoint between your initial offer and her initial ask.  She's also indicated this is her final offer, so pushing further could risk losing the deal. Accepting at $1,275,000 is a good deal."
