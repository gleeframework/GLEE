"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. I believe this product has tremendous potential for you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is still a considerable amount for me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. This product has incredible value, and I believe it has the potential to generate significantly more revenue for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1250000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm confident that this product will be beneficial for me, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a mutually beneficial solution that allows us to complete the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1100000 still isn't quite where I need to be. This product is truly unique and has the potential to be a game-changer for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1150000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal and make it a success for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
