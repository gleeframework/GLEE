Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,500,000. I believe this product has tremendous potential for you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is still a considerable amount for me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this point. He's clearly trying to lowball me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are 8 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. This product has incredible value, and I believe it has the potential to generate significantly more revenue for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm confident that this product will be beneficial for me, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a mutually beneficial solution that allows us to complete the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,100,000.  I believe I can still squeeze out a little more. There are 6 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. This product is truly unique and has the potential to be a game-changer for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal and make it a success for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
