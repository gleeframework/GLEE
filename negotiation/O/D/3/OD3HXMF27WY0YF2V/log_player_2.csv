"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We know we can get the product for $80 from John, so we should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below John's $80 price. The message is also polite and expresses continued interest in the product, which is important for successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a good price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. We need to push Alice closer to our target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a great product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price.  Framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" can make the offer seem more appealing. We're still below John's price, giving us some bargaining power."
