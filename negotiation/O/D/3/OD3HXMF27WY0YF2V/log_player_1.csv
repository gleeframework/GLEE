Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $100 is higher than $80, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is less than your minimum of $120, leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects.
* **It's a fair offer:** The offer is within a reasonable range, leaving room for both parties to compromise.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also far below my initial offer of $100, suggesting he's not serious about negotiating.  While I could potentially make a counteroffer, it's likely that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  

Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's better to cut my losses and move on to a more promising sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a good price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  My counteroffer of $90 is higher than Bob's offer of $65, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Lower than my minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum of $120, but it's closer to my desired price.
* **Reasoned and respectful:** My message is polite and explains the reasoning behind my counteroffer.

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also establishes a clear price floor. It's a strategic move that could either lead to a successful deal or push Bob towards John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a great product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to pay closer to my desired price, and further negotiation would likely be unproductive.

Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price, minimizing any potential losses from further negotiation with Bob."
