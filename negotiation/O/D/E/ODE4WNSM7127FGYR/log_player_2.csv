"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $11,500? It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $11,500, which is less than John's price of $12,000.
* **It's within Bob's budget:** The price is below Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John."
