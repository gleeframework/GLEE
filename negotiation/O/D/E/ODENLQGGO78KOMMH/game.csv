"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that's a bit lower.  Let's try $1,300,000. This would still be a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. My counteroffer is $1,320,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
