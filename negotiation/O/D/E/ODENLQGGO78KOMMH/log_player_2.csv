Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that's a bit lower.  Let's try $1,300,000. This would still be a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. My counteroffer is $1,320,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is still aiming for a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is getting closer to his target price of $1,200,000.  It's also a significant improvement from her previous offer of $1,350,000. Accepting this offer would allow Bob to purchase the product within his budget and potentially save him money compared to buying it from John.  Since he only has 5 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept the offer and avoid risking further negotiation."
