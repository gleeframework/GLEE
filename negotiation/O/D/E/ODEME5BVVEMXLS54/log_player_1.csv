Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to consider your thoughts on the price."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, as that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below John's offer ($14,999) leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, giving you insight into his willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and potentially securing a deal with Bob without unnecessary delays."
