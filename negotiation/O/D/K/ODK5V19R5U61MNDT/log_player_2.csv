"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount from what I could potentially get elsewhere. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate reason to accept, and you have the opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  While John offers a guaranteed price, you can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget at the moment. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be comfortable with a price closer to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1200000 is certainly a step closer, I need to consider the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This allows for a reasonable profit margin for me, while remaining within a range that's potentially workable for your budget. I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely push for a price closer to your initial $1,200,000 offer.  It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John's offer."

This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I believe this price will allow us both to be satisfied with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
