Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential value in this product, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget at the moment. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be comfortable with a price closer to $1200000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I believe this price will allow us both to be satisfied with the outcome.
