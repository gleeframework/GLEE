"Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount from what I could potentially get elsewhere. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential value in this product, $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget at the moment. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be comfortable with a price closer to $1200000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1200000 is certainly a step closer, I need to consider the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This allows for a reasonable profit margin for me, while remaining within a range that's potentially workable for your budget. I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1250000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I believe this price will allow us both to be satisfied with the outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
