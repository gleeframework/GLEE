Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention Bob's perceived value, it subtly implies that the higher price is justified by the product's ""worth in the market.""
* **Alternative Option:** By not revealing John's offer, you maintain leverage. Bob doesn't know your fallback position, making him more likely to consider the current offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust the price downwards during the negotiation, but you can't go higher than your initial offer."
