"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something worth a great deal more.  Let's discuss this further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves a considerable margin for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000 for the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from that price.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $887,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us and keep the deal moving forward.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit away from $887,500. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'd like to make a deal, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",882500.0,Bob,6,
