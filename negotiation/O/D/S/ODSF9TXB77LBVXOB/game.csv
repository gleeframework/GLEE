"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'd love to hear if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to compromise, I believe $1000000 is a bit too low considering the product's value to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This price is a good midpoint and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1075000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
