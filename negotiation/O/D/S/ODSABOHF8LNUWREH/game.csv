"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $975000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to move forward and you to get the product at a price closer to your budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,
