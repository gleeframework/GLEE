"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. If you decide to decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase at my full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you have a better alternative. You can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving you $200,000. 

Alice's mention of another buyer is likely a negotiation tactic. You're better off sticking to your budget and going with the guaranteed lower price from John."
