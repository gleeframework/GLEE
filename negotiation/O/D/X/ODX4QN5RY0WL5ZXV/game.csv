Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1250000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the price I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'd be happy to make the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
