"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000, which still reflects the significant value the product offers. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
