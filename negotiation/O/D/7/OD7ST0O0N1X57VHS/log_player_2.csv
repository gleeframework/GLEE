Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $760,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at $800,000 to make this deal work. I understand we both have our limits, but this is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the potential value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

``` 

Alice has come down to her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this is a good price for you. Taking the deal now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
