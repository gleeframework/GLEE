"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, she has room to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $75 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves her with a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is a good deal, it's still above your target price of $75.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, lowering her price from $85 to $80. This indicates she's open to compromise.  A counteroffer of $78 is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating you're willing to meet her halfway. It's still a decent deal for you, and hopefully, she'll find it acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and at $82, the deal is getting very close to your target of $75.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds, especially as Alice has already rejected a counteroffer.  It's likely that accepting the offer now is the best option, as you're unlikely to get a better price in the remaining rounds."
