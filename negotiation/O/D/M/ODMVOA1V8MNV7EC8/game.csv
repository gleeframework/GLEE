"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit lower than your minimum, but I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer and provides you with a good deal. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us and I'd like to move forward with the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
