Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'm aware of John's offer of $1,200,000, which acts as a safety net. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my chances of getting a good price from Bob while also having a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit lower than your minimum, but I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer is a better alternative:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, which is a much more attractive option.

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's initial counteroffer is too far off from my expectations. I'm choosing to reject his offer and proceed with a counteroffer of my own to try and bridge the gap, but with the knowledge that I can always sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer and provides you with a good deal. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the discount he's getting.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation amicable and focusing on finding a solution.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  It's a compromise that could potentially appeal to Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It's still higher than Bob's offer, allowing me to negotiate further if needed.
* **Keep John in mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer and can use it as a bargaining chip if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us and I'd like to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Bob's willingness to compromise:** Bob has shown a willingness to meet me halfway, indicating he's serious about the deal.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing negotiations could lead to more rounds and potentially a lower price, while John's offer is always available as a backup.

Selling to Bob at $1,025,000 is a good outcome considering my minimum, and it avoids the potential risks of further negotiations."
