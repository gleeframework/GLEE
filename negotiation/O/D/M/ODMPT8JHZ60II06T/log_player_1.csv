{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is higher than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving you some room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $120 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for compromise:**  If Bob counters with a lower price, you have room to bargain. 

By starting at a slightly higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your value. If not, you can always reject his counteroffer and make a new one, or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150 and even lower than your initial offer of $120. 
* **You have a better alternative:**  You can sell the product to John for $150, which is a much better deal for you.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to send a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired value.

**Next Steps:**

Since you've rejected Bob's offer, you can now make a counteroffer to Bob. You have some leverage, as you have a guaranteed sale with John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too far below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer offers a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer. It shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring you receive a price closer to your desired value.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer and highlights the value of the product. This helps build trust and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering a price above Bob's initial counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell and you value the product. This gives you more leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

Now you wait for Bob's response. He can either accept your counteroffer, reject it, or make a new counteroffer. Based on his response, you can decide if you want to continue negotiating or sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $60 was probably too low. I could potentially go up to $70, but that's really the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $70 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150, and you have a guaranteed sale with John for $150.
* **No room for significant negotiation:**  While you could make another counteroffer, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer much further. Continuing to negotiate would risk wasting time and potentially losing the deal with John.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By selling to John, you guarantee yourself a higher profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, selling to John for $150 is the most rational and profitable decision."
