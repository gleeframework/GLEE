"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for getting back to me.  I appreciate the movement but $1,300,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,200,000? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
