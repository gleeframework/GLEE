"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a bold move, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm starting high to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still a good price for me and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer and represents a good profit for me. I'm willing to close the deal before risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
