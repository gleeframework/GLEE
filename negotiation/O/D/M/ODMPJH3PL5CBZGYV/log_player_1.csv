Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it has a few advantages:

* **Sets a high bar:**  This immediately demonstrates the value I place on the product. It might make Bob more inclined to negotiate seriously.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's ample room for me to adjust and come down in price if necessary. 
* **Time pressure:**  Bob knows I have an alternative buyer (John) who will pay $1,000,000, creating a sense of urgency and potential pressure on him to negotiate. 

I'll carefully observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant improvement from my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to try and squeeze out more value. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Signal my commitment to a higher price:** This demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I can use the counteroffer to explore if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my initial asking price.
* **Increase chances of a better outcome:**  The negotiation process can lead to a more favorable price for me.

It's a calculated risk, but I believe the potential payoff outweighs the risk of settling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,350,000 represents a compromise:

* **Lower than my initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that I'm still not willing to settle for his proposed price. 
* **Reasonable midpoint:** This positions the counteroffer as a fair meeting point, potentially encouraging Bob to consider accepting.

This approach aims to balance my desire for a higher price with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward. I'm confident that I can secure a price closer to my initial target, but I'm also willing to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is closer to my initial ask, but it's still less than what I hoped for. However, considering the following factors:

* **Potential for further rejection:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he will come up further. I risk a stalemate or even a lower offer from him.
* **Time and effort:**  Negotiations can be exhausting and time-consuming. This offer is a decent compromise that saves me from further rounds of haggling.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  While I might not get the full amount I desired, $1,225,000 is still a substantial profit and significantly higher than selling to John.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most practical and financially sound decision at this point. It allows me to secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of a less favorable outcome."
