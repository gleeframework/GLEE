Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited time"" offer, there's a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and not risk missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $119, there might be a small window for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially earn slightly more than $120.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profit and ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
