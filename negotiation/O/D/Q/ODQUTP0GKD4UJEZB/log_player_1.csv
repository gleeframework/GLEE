Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it would be valuable to you, but if you're not interested, that's okay. Just let me know!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $140 is a good starting point. It's a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but also makes it clear you have other options if Bob declines. 
 
This strategy aims to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while still ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
