{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

 You're trying to save as much money as possible, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can always buy from John if you can't get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You're still trying to get a lower price.  Even though $107.50 is closer to your target, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is getting close to your maximum, you're still within your budget and have several rounds left to negotiate. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. How about $107?"", ""product_price"": 107}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $108, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $109 to break even. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her minimum, and you're getting closer to your maximum.  While you'd like to pay less, it's likely you won't be able to get a lower price, and you're running out of rounds. It's a good deal considering you're still under your budget."
