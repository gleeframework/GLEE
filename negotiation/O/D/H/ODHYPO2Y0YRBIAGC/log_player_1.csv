"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a starting price of $150. I believe it's a fantastic deal, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to go and meets my minimum. However, I already have John offering the same amount. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob."
