"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $8000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price of $8,000. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?
