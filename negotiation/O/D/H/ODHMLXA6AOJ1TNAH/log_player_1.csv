"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** $1,200,000 is a good midpoint between my minimum and his potential maximum value. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my desired range with further negotiation.
* **Avoiding a Rushed Decision:** Selling to John right now would secure me a profit, but I'm confident I can do better with Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will use the next round to propose a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a desire to find a common ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob while emphasizing the fairness of my price. This encourages him to accept the offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $1,050,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable amount of $800,000.
* **Time is a Factor:**  We are already four rounds into the negotiation. Continuing to haggle risks further delays and potential for Bob to change his mind.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit for me, and I'm confident that $1,050,000 is a good deal considering the value Bob places on the product."
