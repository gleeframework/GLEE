"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential value. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal. This should incentivize Bob to accept, as it's still a significant gain for him."

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to push Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but this time only by $50,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong position.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, as he's only $100,000 away from his desired price."

I'm still determined to get a higher price.  Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time.  Offering $975,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hopeful this will be enough to seal the deal, as I'm only $25,000 away from his offer, and I'm only $75,000 away from my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is only $75,000 away from my minimum, I'm going to try and negotiate a bit more. I still have a couple of rounds left, and I believe I can get a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to raise my counteroffer to $900,000. This is a compromise between our last two offers and is within a reasonable range. I believe this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept, as it is only $25,000 away from his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round and Bob's offer is below my minimum.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $800,000."
