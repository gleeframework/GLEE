Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it might bring, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price,  $825,000 is a good deal and it's within my acceptable range.  It's better than selling to John for $800,000, and it secures a sale without risking further negotiation rounds."
