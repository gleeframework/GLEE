Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" adds weight to the offer, potentially making Bob more receptive."
