"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $9500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I believe it's a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in the product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $8500.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. With that in mind, I'm willing to lower the price to $9200. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being fair to me. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8800.  This price represents a significant savings for me, and I think it's fair considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8800. I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer, and I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. With that in mind, I'm willing to meet you at $9000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
