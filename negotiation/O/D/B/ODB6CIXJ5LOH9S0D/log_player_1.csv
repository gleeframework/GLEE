{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation by highlighting the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with a compromise. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is just above my minimum price of $80 and is a good compromise.  I'd rather sell to Bob at this price than risk losing the sale and only getting $80 from John."
