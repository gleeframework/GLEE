"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $925,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand we're both trying to find a good deal here. Let's split the difference again and go with $950,000. I'm confident this price is fair to both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
