**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's unlikely to reach the $1,500,000 mark within the remaining rounds.  At this point, it's more strategic to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's better to walk away with a sure profit than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price."
