Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident you'd find it well worth a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) but still enticing to Bob.
* **Understand Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while keeping you well above your baseline.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential gain while having a safety net (selling to John) if needed."
