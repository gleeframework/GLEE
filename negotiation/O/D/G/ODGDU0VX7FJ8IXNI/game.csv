"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17500, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope we can agree on this.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to increase your offer.  While $12000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13500. This would allow you a good deal and give me a price closer to what I believe the product is worth. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,5,
