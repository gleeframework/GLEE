"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he has room to negotiate. He should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant drop from her initial offer, $10,500 is still above his maximum budget. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. That's a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better price. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product. I'm hoping we can close the deal on this round."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

While Alice's offer of $9,800 is tempting and closer to his target price, he's already had multiple rounds of negotiation and it's unclear if he'll be able to get a lower price from Alice.  The risk of further negotiation with Alice is too high, given that he can secure the product from John for $8,000.  He has a limited number of rounds and needs to make a decisive move."
