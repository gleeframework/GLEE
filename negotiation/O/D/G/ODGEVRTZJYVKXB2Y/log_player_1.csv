``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob the impression that I'm willing to work with him, making him more likely to engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. It's not worth it to accept his offer. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we settle at $650,000? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $650,000 is better than $600,000, it's still far from what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $650,000 just isn't feasible for me.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and agree on $725,000? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 725000}
