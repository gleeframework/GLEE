"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting point for negotiation. Alice's offer is too high. You have room to make a counteroffer that is significantly lower but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Significant Jump Down:** It makes a substantial step down from Alice's initial offer, aiming to move the negotiation closer to your desired price range.
* **Shows Serious Interest:**  By stating you're ""interested"" but need a lower price, you show you're serious about buying but not willing to overpay.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** Offering $600,000 doesn't bring you immediately to your $800,000 walk-away point. This leaves space for further counteroffers if Alice is willing to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $700,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price. However, you're still below your walk-away point. There's room to counter-offer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we settle at $650,000? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:**  By moving up from $600,000, you demonstrate you're willing to meet Alice somewhere in the middle.
* **Stays Below Walk-Away:** The $650,000 offer keeps you well below your $800,000 maximum, preserving your potential savings.
* **Puts the Ball in Alice's Court:**  This offer might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, given that it's significantly above your initial offer. If she rejects it, you'll know she's probably not going much lower, and you can consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $650,000 just isn't feasible for me.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and agree on $725,000? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  You're getting the product for $75,000 less than John's offer, a good deal.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower. She's already compromised significantly.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If you counter-offer again and Alice rejects it, you might end up having to buy from John anyway, losing your negotiating advantage."
