Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its unique qualities and benefits. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I aim high, starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly motivated. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price just below $12,000 might make Bob perceive it as a better deal, even though it's only a dollar less.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or how desperate he might be for the product. If I had more insights into Bob's behavior, I could potentially adjust my strategy for a higher offer."
