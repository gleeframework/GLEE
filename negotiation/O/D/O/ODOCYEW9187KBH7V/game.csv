"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still gives you a significant profit margin. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to you, I believe $1,050,000 is a fair compromise that will allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
