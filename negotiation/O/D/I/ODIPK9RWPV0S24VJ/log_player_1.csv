Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value you've put into it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
