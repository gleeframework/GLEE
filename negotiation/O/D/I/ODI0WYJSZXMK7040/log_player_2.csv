Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still willing to pay up to $12,000 and can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He's already made a lower counter-offer, so Alice is likely to be more open to further negotiation."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and this offer is significantly lower than that. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that he'll end up paying the full $12,000 to John. It's a good deal for Bob, so it's best to take it."
