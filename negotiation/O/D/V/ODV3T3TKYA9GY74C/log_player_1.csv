Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Aiming too high risks losing him, while aiming too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of value and urgency.
* **Confidence:**  Emphasizes your belief in the product's worth.
* **Price:**  $1,350,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($150,000) while netting you a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Limited Time:**  Creates a sense of urgency, encouraging a faster decision.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to slightly adjust your price if Bob counters, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
