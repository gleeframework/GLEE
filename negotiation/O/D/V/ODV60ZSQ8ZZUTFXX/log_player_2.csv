"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but $700,000 is still too high.  As Bob, I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $650,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $650,000, which is closer to my target price of $600,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting her offer at $650,000 allows me to save $150,000 compared to buying from John."
