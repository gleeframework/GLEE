"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $650,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Alice,3,
