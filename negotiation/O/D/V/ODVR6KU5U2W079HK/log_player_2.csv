"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. While I'm happy to provide you with more information, I'm confident in its worth and believe it will be worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount considering its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is also very interested.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you at a high price by mentioning $1,200,000. While her offer of $1,000,000 is below your maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her initial offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $800,000 valuation. Even if she doesn't budge much, you can always fall back on John's offer."
