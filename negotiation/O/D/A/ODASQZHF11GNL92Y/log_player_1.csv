"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's relatively high but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone can make Bob feel more comfortable negotiating and open to the offer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Even though Bob's offer is higher than my minimum ( $80 ), it's still below the product's worth to him ( $120 ). This means there's room for further negotiation to get a better price. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob by counteroffering. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John at this point would guarantee $80, but there's a good chance I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not simply going to accept his first counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** Offering a price midway between our previous offers shows I'm trying to find a middle ground.
* **Directness:**  I'm being direct and upfront with my counteroffer, showing confidence and commitment to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we can find a middle ground. How about $92 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Value:**  Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $95.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're already in round 4, and it's important to consider that I have a limited number of rounds left.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the potential to build a good relationship with Bob for future deals is valuable.  

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, accepting this offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
