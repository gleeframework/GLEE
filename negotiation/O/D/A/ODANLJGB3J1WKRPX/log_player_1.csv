Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  Given my assessment, I believe $1,300,000 is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering its potential worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  Let's aim for a price closer to the middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. John guarantees that amount with no further negotiation or risk."
