Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. While your price is attractive, I'm aiming to keep my investment below $700,000. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $680,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
