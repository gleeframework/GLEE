"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a steal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a small step from your offer, but it reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm at my absolute limit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,100. This is a final price,  I can't go any lower. It's still a great deal, and I hope you'll consider it. Let me know what you decide. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to move forward with another buyer.",9100.0,Alice,7,
