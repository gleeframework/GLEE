"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a steal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive message that highlights the value of the product and suggests a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for flexibility in the subsequent rounds. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **My Minimum:** Remember, I will not accept anything less than $12,000 for the product.
* **John's Offer:**  John is a safety net, offering a guaranteed $12,000, so I don't need to be desperate to close a deal with Bob. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'll need to be flexible and assess Bob's responses to determine the best strategy for getting the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting it would mean a major loss.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which is far more appealing than Bob's low offer.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than his offer but closer to my minimum. I will also try to understand why Bob is so hesitant to pay more, which will help me tailor future offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** The offer of $9,500 presents a compromise that is closer to Bob's desired price while still giving me a reasonable profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify the price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  I am still aware of John's offer of $12,000 and am using it as a baseline to ensure I don't settle for a price that is too low.
* **Assessing Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer to understand his willingness to negotiate and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it is closer to my desired price, accepting it would still result in a loss.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which is much better than Bob's current offer.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. He has shown willingness to compromise, and with continued negotiation, I may be able to get closer to my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is slightly higher than his current offer, hoping to get him closer to my target. I will also try to understand Bob's budget constraints better to tailor my next offer accordingly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a small step from your offer, but it reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:**  I'm making a small, incremental adjustment to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I emphasize that I am making a compromise to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the price and encourage Bob to see the benefit of a slightly higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind, as it provides a safety net and allows me to confidently negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a low offer.
* **Bob's Budget:** I'm trying to gauge Bob's budget constraints to determine if a higher offer would be possible.

**Next Steps:**

Based on Bob's response to this offer, I will adjust my strategy accordingly. If he seems unwilling to budge further, I might consider accepting his offer to avoid further delays. However, if I sense a willingness to compromise, I might try to push for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We seem to be stuck at a price point that is still too low for me.  Bob is unwilling to go higher, and I'm unwilling to go lower than my minimum. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which is still my primary goal. 
* **Risk of Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delaying the sale and potentially losing out on John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly higher price, but I will also make it clear that this is my final offer. If he rejects it, I will move forward with selling the product to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm at my absolute limit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,100. This is a final price,  I can't go any lower. It's still a great deal, and I hope you'll consider it. Let me know what you decide. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept.
* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount from Bob's last offer, hoping to bridge the gap without significantly jeopardizing the deal.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm being direct about my limitations and the consequences of rejection, making it clear that I'm serious about moving on if he doesn't accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, as it provides a safety net and allows me to confidently stand firm on my final offer. 
* **Risk of Losing Bob:** I'm aware that I might lose Bob as a buyer, but I'm willing to take that risk to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

Based on Bob's response, I'll either accept his offer or move forward with selling to John. I'm now at a critical point in the negotiation, and my decisions will have a significant impact on the outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $9,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We're back to a stalemate with Bob's offer at $9,000. I'm at my limit, and he's not willing to go higher. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're on round 8, and I have only a few rounds left before John's offer expires.
* **Guaranteeing Profit:** John's offer guarantees me $12,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and allows me to avoid further negotiation risks. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would ideally like to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to agree.  To secure a profitable outcome and avoid further delays, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. This ensures I receive my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing both potential buyers."
