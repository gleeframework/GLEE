"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I aim to start high enough to potentially secure a decent profit, but low enough to incentivize Bob to consider the offer and engage in negotiation. I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on his responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below the value of the product to Bob ($8,000). Accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I have 8 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $9,000 is a compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer of $12,000 but still well above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  The message is still friendly but firm, acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing my own position. I'm aiming to find a middle ground. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to show flexibility while maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum. By demonstrating willingness to negotiate, I hope to encourage Bob to consider a higher offer without completely shutting down the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $6,500.  Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I have 6 rounds left, and there's still time to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer. I'll continue to be flexible but firm in my position, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm aware that John is always an option, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $8,500 is a further compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my price.  It also reminds Bob of the product's value, subtly pushing him towards accepting my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm narrowing the gap between our offers and showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept my offer or come closer to my desired price. I still have five rounds left, so there's time to explore options. However, I'm mindful of my minimum price and the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $7,000. That's a pretty good offer considering I can buy it from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already compromised considerably, and with only four rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll aim for a price closer to $8,000, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm aware that John is always an option, but I'm determined to try and get a better deal from Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a more favorable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you can purchase it from John for $8,000. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $7,500 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $7,000 and my previous offer of $8,500. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the win-win nature of the deal. It also highlights the value of the product and the alternative option, subtly urging Bob to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between securing a decent profit and closing the deal. This counteroffer is a calculated risk, aiming to entice Bob to accept while remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also aware of the option to sell to John for $15,000, which I can still leverage if necessary."
