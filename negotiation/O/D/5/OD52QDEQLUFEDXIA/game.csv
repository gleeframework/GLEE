"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1200000 to me. I believe it has significant value for the right person, and I think you might be that person. I'm willing to part with it for a price that's less than its true worth to me, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
