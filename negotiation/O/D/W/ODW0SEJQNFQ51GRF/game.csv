"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit on this valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a good compromise and ensures we both get a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
