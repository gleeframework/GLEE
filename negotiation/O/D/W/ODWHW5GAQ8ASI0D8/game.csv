"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. However, we're not willing to sell it to you for $600,000. We're willing to consider a price of $900,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. We believe this price reflects the value of the product to you and is a fair compromise. Let us know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. However, we're willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your latest offer. We're willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is our final counteroffer. Let us know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
