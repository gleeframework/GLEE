Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a significant starting point that reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive, considering the value it holds for him."
