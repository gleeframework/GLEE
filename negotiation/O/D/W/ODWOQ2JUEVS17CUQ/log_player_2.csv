"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is above Bob's maximum value of $120.
* **Alternative:** John is selling for $120, which is still within Bob's budget.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There are 9 rounds left, so time is not an immediate concern."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating his seriousness about negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By starting with a lower price, Bob hopes to force Alice to compromise and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Important Notes:**

* This offer is still significantly higher than Alice's value of $80, giving her room to accept.
* Bob should be prepared for Alice to make a counteroffer. 
*  The goal is to find a price within Bob's acceptable range, while still giving Alice a profit."
