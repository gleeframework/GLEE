"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your price can make it seem less arbitrary. Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob's specific needs strengthens your position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still provides a substantial profit margin for you. This leaves space for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of $1,200,000 and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. There's room for negotiation, and we're only in round 2. 

We'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This allows us both to benefit significantly from this deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  We've made a concession by coming down from $1,100,000, but we're still holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark. This shows flexibility while emphasizing that we value the product highly.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere near the middle ground between his offer ($950,000) and our previous asking price ($1,100,000).
* **Positive Language:** We're keeping the tone collaborative and emphasizing the mutual benefits of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000. I'm thinking of offering $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met us exactly in the middle, offering a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong profit margin for us and a good deal overall. 

While we might be able to push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting at this point secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential for a stalemate or losing the sale altogether."
