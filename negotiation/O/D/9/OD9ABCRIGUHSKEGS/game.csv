"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but based on my assessment, I am not willing to pay $2000000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to my valuation of $1500000? I look forward to your response.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your valuation. While I'm willing to negotiate, a price of $1500000 is below my minimum acceptable threshold.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This takes into account the value you've identified and allows me to achieve a fair return.  Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1750000 is slightly above my valuation for the product. Could we possibly meet at $1600000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
