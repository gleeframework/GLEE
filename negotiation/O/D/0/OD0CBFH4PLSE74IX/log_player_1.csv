{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation and still get a good price.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show some flexibility and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $130. How about $127? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, $127 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for more.  I'm also concerned that Bob might get frustrated and walk away if I keep rejecting his offers."
