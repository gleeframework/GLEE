Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but reasonable:** Starting at $950,000 is a high price but still leaves room for Bob to potentially find it a good deal compared to its worth to him ($800,000).
* **Time pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and offering a price that Bob might find attractive enough to accept."
