"Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows us both to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
