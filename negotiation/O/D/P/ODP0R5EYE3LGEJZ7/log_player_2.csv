"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting price is too high. Since your maximum value for the product is $100 and John will sell it to you at that price, there's no reason to accept anything over $100. You should counteroffer with a much lower price to see if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John since you'll pay $100 either way."
