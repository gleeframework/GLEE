"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we do $90? That's a fair bit closer to your asking price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $90 is still a bit low for me.  Could you do $105? That's only a little bit more than you were offering.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and do $97.50? That seems like a fair compromise.",97.5,Bob,6,
