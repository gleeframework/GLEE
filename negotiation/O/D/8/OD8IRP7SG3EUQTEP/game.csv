"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still a significant profit for you, and I'd be able to stay within my spending limit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's a significant profit for you while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I won't go any lower.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
