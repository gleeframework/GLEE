"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to acquire the product at a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob needs to start lower than Alice's initial offer but not too low that it feels insulting.  $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,050,000 leaves room for Alice to counteroffer without losing too much.  It also signals Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product. 
* **Messaging:**  The message is polite but firm, acknowledging Alice's offer while highlighting Bob's desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to acquire the product at a lower price, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1080000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $1,080,000 is a decent compromise.
* **Time is Money:**  While there might be room for further negotiation, accepting the offer now saves time and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further.
* **John's Price:**  $1,080,000 is still significantly less than buying from John, making it a worthwhile deal."
