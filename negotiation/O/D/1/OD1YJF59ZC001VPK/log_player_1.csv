Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but still allows me to potentially make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I will counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly higher than what I could get from John. While I would have preferred more, it's a good deal and worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
