Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified.
* **Time Pressure:**  By suggesting you'll list the product publicly, you create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price, which encourages Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high. 
 
**Important:**  It's crucial to remember you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000.  You can always adjust your price down in subsequent messages if Bob rejects the initial offer."
