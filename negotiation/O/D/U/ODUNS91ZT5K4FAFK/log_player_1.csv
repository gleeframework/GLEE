"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  If he rejects, we'll see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can close the deal closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, hoping to meet him halfway.  This shows good faith while still staying within my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is still a very good profit.  It's important to be realistic and not risk losing a sale by being too stubborn."
