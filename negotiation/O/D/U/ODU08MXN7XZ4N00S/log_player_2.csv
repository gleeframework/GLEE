"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **Ambitious but believable:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. However, $900,000 is still a substantial amount, suggesting I'm a serious buyer.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's a good chance Alice will reject this offer, but it gives us space to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative in mind:** I haven't forgotten about John. If Alice is unwilling to budge significantly, I can always walk away and take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has met my price point. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John, as they both offer the same price now."
