Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downward if necessary. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counter-offers, it opens up negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiations with Bob."
