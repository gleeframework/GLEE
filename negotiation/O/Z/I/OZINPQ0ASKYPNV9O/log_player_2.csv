Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with. I'm ready to close this deal and see this product benefit your business. Let's meet in the middle at $1,360,000. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to move forward.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,360,000 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further,  the risk of her rejecting my offer and the possibility of needing to buy from John at a higher price make this offer a good deal.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept."
