"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for negotiation while staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and frames the price as fair, encouraging Bob to engage positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer by strategically countering. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is my fallback option, but I'm not ready to settle for that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product to your specific needs is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession ($25,000) than Bob's initial counteroffer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value proposition to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our initial offers and move the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,375,000 is closer to what I can do, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'd like to offer $1,350,000. This would allow us both to save some money and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but I believe I can still get a slightly better price from Bob.  While his offer is reasonable, I'm willing to push for a bit more in the next round or two. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,360,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with. I'm ready to close this deal and see this product benefit your business. Let's meet in the middle at $1,360,000. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to move forward."", 
""product_price"": 1360000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Closing:** By stating my willingness to close the deal, I'm adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer offers a clear compromise point, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Final Push:** This is my final push for a higher price. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider accepting his previous offer in the next round to avoid risking the deal altogether."
