Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. My starting price is $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,250 is closer to his target, he's still over his ideal price point and can likely negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $9,100.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice's final offer of $9,100 is tempting, Bob is still slightly over his budget. He has already reached a point where he is likely to get stuck in a negotiation loop with Alice.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his maximum price point and avoids further negotiation."
