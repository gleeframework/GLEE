Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my minimum price, hoping to influence Bob's perception of its worth."
