Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $90?  That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
