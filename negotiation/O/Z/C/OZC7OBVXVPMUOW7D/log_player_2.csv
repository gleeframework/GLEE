"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his desired price, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to push for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a good compromise for both of us.  It allows you to make a profit and me to get a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 5

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still committed to saving money. Even though Alice's offer is closer to his budget, there's still room for negotiation. He can try to push for a lower price in the next round.  Buying from John is still a more expensive option, so Bob should keep trying to negotiate with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, and while Alice's offer is getting closer to his target, he's still not satisfied. He can make one more counteroffer to try and push for a lower price.  Buying from John is still a more expensive option, so Bob should keep trying to negotiate with Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round of negotiations with Alice.  While Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous one, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  There's no guarantee that Bob can negotiate a better price in the final round, and he only has one more counteroffer available.  Considering the limited time and the risk of not reaching an agreement, it's more sensible for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000. This ensures he gets the product and avoids further uncertainty."
