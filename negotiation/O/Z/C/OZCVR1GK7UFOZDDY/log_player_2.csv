Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? This would be a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?
