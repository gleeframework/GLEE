{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise. However, it's not too high to immediately deter him. It also includes a positive and encouraging message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $14000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $14,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $15500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15250.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's more than what I'd get from John. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
