"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $10,000. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move forward. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
