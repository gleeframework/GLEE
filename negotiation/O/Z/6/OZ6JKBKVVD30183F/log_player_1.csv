"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and even Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a sense of his willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to anchor the price in Bob's mind at a high point, even if he intends to negotiate down.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and suggests that this is just an opening position, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value ($1,200,000) but still significantly below my minimum ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while still encouraging him to move upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's worth to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The new price aims to move the negotiation closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a significant gain for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price given my limited budget. I hope you will reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,400,000, which is only $100,000 less than my guaranteed sale to John. While I could try to push for more, the risk of Bob walking away and losing that $100,000 difference is too high. It's a strong offer and a good deal overall."
