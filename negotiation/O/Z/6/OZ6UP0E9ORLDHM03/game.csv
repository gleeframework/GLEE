"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  This product has the potential to be incredibly valuable, as we've discussed. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but I have budgetary constraints to consider.  Could you possibly do $1,075,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to make a deal.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000. This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
