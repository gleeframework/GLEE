# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in paying $100 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $80 to Alice.
* **Alice's Offer:** $100
