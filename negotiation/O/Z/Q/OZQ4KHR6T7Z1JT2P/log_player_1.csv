Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging interest:**  A high initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob truly is. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost much. If he counters, you know he's seriously considering it.
* **Profit maximization:** While $20,000 might seem steep, remember your goal is to maximize profit.  Even if Bob negotiates you down, you're still likely to get a better price than John's guaranteed offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower your asking price, but you can't raise it once an offer is made."
