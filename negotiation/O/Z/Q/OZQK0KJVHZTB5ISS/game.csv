"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $22000. It's a premium product, and I believe it's worth every penny.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is premium, but $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $19500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $19500 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $21000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but $21000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $20250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",20250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $20250 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $21500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",21500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $21500 is still a bit too high. I'm offering $20750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",20750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $22000? It's a price I'm willing to accept, and it's still a great deal for you.",22000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to go above $20000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",20000.0,Bob,10,
