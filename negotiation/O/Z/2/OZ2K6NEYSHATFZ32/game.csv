"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm ready to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm paying a significant premium over John's offer, and you're getting closer to your desired price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
