"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Rejecting Alice's offer makes sense here. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is better than Alice's $14,000 offer."
