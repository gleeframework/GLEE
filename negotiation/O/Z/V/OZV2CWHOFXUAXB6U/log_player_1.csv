Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing we have John as a backup.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting high allows Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Psychological pricing:** $14,000 seems more appealing than a round $15,000 and is still significantly above Bob's perceived value.

**It's important to note:** This strategy aims high. There's a chance Bob outright rejects the offer. However, it gives us the best chance to maximize profit before resorting to the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
