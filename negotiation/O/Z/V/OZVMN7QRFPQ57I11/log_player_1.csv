Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Target:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we don't want to limit ourselves to that. Aiming higher initially leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,500,000, there's space for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the initial price too high. This makes it more likely for us to reach a mutually agreeable price that's still above our minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as an ""investment,"" subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob might reject this initial offer outright. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, we can afford to start high and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
