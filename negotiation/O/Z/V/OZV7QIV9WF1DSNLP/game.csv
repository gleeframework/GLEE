"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which is worth $1200000 to you, at a price of $1250000. This is a great deal, as you'll be getting it for a small premium above its value to you. However, if you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1200000, so it's a win-win situation for both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
