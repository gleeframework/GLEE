"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob in the next few rounds."

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not comfortable selling at this price.  I believe I can push him a bit further and secure a better deal. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price of $1,250,000 in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are close! I can tell we're both motivated to make this happen.  I can offer $1,198,437. Let's get this deal closed!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my target price, it's getting very close. I've already gone through a significant number of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to push for a higher price.  At this point, selling to Bob for $1,198,437 is the best option compared to selling to John for $1,000,000 or risking another round of negotiations with Bob and potentially a worse outcome."
