Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  I'm eager to work with you, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
