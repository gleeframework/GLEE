"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  I'm eager to work with you, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I see the value you place on the product, but $1,000,000 falls quite a bit short of my expectations.  How about we meet in the middle - would you be willing to consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this point. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? I believe this price is fair given the value of the product to both of us. ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
