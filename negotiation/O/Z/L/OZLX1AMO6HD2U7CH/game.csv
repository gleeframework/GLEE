"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'm willing to start with a competitive offer of $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $750000. Would you be willing to meet me at $775000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $825000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
