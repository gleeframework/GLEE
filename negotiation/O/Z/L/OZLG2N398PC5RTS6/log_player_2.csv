You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $80, and her offer is $100. You can do better.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or you can buy the product from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $80, and her offer is $92.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or you can buy the product from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $88. That's a fair price, and it's closer to my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer you $90, which is the best I can do. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $90 is still above your budget of $80. At this point, it's better to buy from John. You've already negotiated quite a bit with Alice, and it seems unlikely she'll drop her price further.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
