Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows the product's worth to her ($1,500,000) and John's guaranteed purchase price. She starts high to maximize potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still go down slightly while remaining above her minimum.
* **Value justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind. 
* **Open-ended question:**  ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially reveal more about his position.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the safety net of selling to John at her desired price."
