"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $8,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,000? That's the price I'm willing to pay, and it's the price I was originally considering when I first saw the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
