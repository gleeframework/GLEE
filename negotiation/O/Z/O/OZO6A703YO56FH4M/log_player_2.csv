"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if we can get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This tactic leaves us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message is polite and expresses continued interest, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Not Too Low:**  While we're aiming low, $65 isn't offensively low considering Alice values the product at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but $82.50 is still closer to her desired price than ours. We have room to push back further before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can get her closer to $70 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice. How about we settle on $72? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 72
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not drastically. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** $72 is closer to a true middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's counter-offer, making it a reasonable proposal. 
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward and proposes a specific price, encouraging Alice to respond in kind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up yet, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $77.50. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but $77.50 is still a bit too high.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $75 before accepting defeat and going with John.  We're getting into the later rounds, so Alice might be more willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This offer directly proposes splitting the difference between our previous offer ($72) and her counter-offer ($77.50). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and a desire to close the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're getting into the later rounds, so phrasing like ""drive a hard bargain"" and ""willing to meet you halfway"" subtly imply that time is a factor, potentially motivating Alice to agree. 
* **Final Offer (Almost):**  While not explicitly our ""final offer,"" $75 is a price point we're comfortable with. If Alice rejects this, we'll likely go with John in the next round unless she makes a significant move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $75 yet. I'll offer you the product for $78. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. While $78 isn't our ideal, it's only $3 more than our target and significantly less than John's $100 offer.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the final rounds. If we keep pushing, we risk Alice becoming less flexible, and we might have to settle for John's offer anyway. 
* **Minimize Risk:** Accepting now guarantees we get the product at a reasonable price. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of not reaching a deal at all."
