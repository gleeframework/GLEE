"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
