"I understand that $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your time, but we're just too far apart on price. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but $12,250 is more than I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $11,250 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",11250.0,Bob,6,,
