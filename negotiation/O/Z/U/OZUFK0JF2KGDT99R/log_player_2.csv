"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than both your maximum and Alice's value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $10,500 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's value ($10,000) but well below my maximum and her initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** I don't want to go too low too quickly and risk offending Alice or making her think I'm not serious. 
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counteroffer will help me understand Alice's flexibility and how aggressively I need to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No Progress:** Alice has simply returned to her initial offer of $12,000. This shows she might not be very flexible. 
* **Time Constraint:** While we have rounds to go, it's important to make progress and not get stuck haggling over a small difference for too long.
* **Alternative:**  John's offer of $15,000 is still on the table, and getting closer to $12,000 isn't worth the risk of exceeding my budget if Alice is stubborn."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** By increasing my offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Slow Progression:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $500, showing Alice that I'm not willing to budge too quickly towards her price. 
* **Strategic Position:** This puts the price closer to the middle ground while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Movement:** Alice is barely budging on her price, only dropping it by $250. This suggests she's trying to hold firm around the $12,000 mark.
* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and Alice doesn't seem willing to make significant concessions.  
* **Alternative:** The longer this drags on, the less appealing Alice's offer becomes compared to John's fixed $15,000.  It's time to signal I'm serious about walking away if she doesn't move closer to my range."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your time, but we're just too far apart on price. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but $12,250 is more than I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $11,250 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer. 
* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing my previous offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but not significantly. 
* **Ultimatum:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have John's offer as a backup.  This adds pressure for her to make a real decision.
* **Time:**  We're running out of rounds, and this offer strikes a balance between trying to get a good deal and not risking an impasse."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My final offer is $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is stuck at $12,500, and I've been clear about my $11,250 limit.  We're unlikely to bridge this gap.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has labeled her offer as ""final,"" signaling she's not willing to negotiate further. 
* **Time Wasted:** Continuing the negotiation will likely result in a stalemate and wasted rounds, putting me in a weaker position as the deadline approaches.
* **John's Price:** While John's price is higher ($15,000), it's fixed and guarantees I can get the product. Accepting defeat now is better than risking a much higher cost if the negotiations with Alice completely fail."
