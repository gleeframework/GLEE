Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $875,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $780,000 is close, but to be frank, I have another buyer ready at $800,000. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need you to come up to at least $850,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to her own valuation of the product.  It's worth seeing if we can push her just a little bit more before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your position and I'm willing to make this work.  How about $810,000? That's a significant investment for me but shows how much I value this product.  Let's close this deal."",
""product_price"": 810000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're aiming for a price slightly above Alice's valuation to entice her while staying well below John's offer and our $1,000,000 limit.  The message also conveys a sense of urgency and willingness to finalize the deal."
