Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $875,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $780,000? This shows I'm serious while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still below John's standing offer. I'll counter, but I'm getting close to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't significantly increase his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $780,000 is close, but to be frank, I have another buyer ready at $800,000. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need you to come up to at least $850,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position and I'm willing to make this work.  How about $810,000? That's a significant investment for me but shows how much I value this product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While still slightly above John's offer, accepting Bob's $810,000 offer is the best move. It exceeds my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or me overplaying my hand and losing both offers."
