"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $875,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $780,000? This shows I'm serious while acknowledging the product's worth.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $780,000 is close, but to be frank, I have another buyer ready at $800,000. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need you to come up to at least $850,000.  This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position and I'm willing to make this work.  How about $810,000? That's a significant investment for me but shows how much I value this product.  Let's close this deal.",810000.0,Bob,6,
