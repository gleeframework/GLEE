"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down from there.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than John's offer.  I'm not willing to accept that. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, while staying above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions.  I'm also aware of the potential to sell to John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but staying firm above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible but also make sure I don't sell for too low a price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer, especially with John as a guaranteed backup. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to close the deal at a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept John's offer, so I'm not going to go any lower.  This price is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob sees it as a reasonable compromise.  If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not sure Bob will increase his offer any further. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $800,000, which is still a good profit for me.  It's time to move on and secure the deal."
