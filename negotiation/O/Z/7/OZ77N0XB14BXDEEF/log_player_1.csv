Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial discount compared to John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the time sensitivity and exclusivity of the offer, potentially influencing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Outcome Considerations:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, we achieve a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at the guaranteed price."
