"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since we know the product's value to her is significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest while clearly stating our price limit. 

This strategy aims to move the negotiation closer to a price point favorable to us while keeping the door open for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives you a good price, and allows me to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. She came down by $10, indicating a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Room for More:**  We're still significantly above her value ($120) and our target price. There's room for further negotiation.

We'll continue to counter-offer, aiming to guide the price closer to our ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  How about we meet halfway at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're proposing a classic negotiation tactic â€“ meeting in the middle of the current price range ($100 - $130). 
* **Framing as Fair:**  Presenting $115 as a ""fair compromise"" makes it more appealing to Alice and positions it as a win-win solution.

This approach aims to find an agreement quickly while staying within a reasonable budget."
