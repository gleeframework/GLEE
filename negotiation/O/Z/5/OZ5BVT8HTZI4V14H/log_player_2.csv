"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an initial offer of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more at this point.  Rejecting gives Bob the chance to counteroffer and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to his target, it's still more than he'd pay John. He has more room to negotiate down, and he should try to get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  How about we split the difference again and go with $875,000?  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  He's getting closer to his goal price, but $920,000 is still too high. He has more room to negotiate and should keep pushing for a lower price.  He should also remember that he has the option to buy from John for $800,000 at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. While I understand your need to make a profit, I'm not willing to go above $875,000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the alternative option I have. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your target price, but I'm not willing to go below $920,000 as we previously discussed. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $875,000. I'm counteroffering at $950,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has shown a strong unwillingness to budge below $920,000, and the negotiations have been going on for a while.  Bob has clearly outlined his desired price point and has made several compromises, yet Alice hasn't come close to meeting him there.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the sure thing of buying from John."
