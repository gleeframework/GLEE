"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97?  That's a fair compromise.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you think $97 is a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway once, and I think I deserve a bit more for my product. I'm willing to offer you the product for $102. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",102.0,Alice,5,
