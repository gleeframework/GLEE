"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm making a fair profit. How about we meet at $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $9500 to $9000 and now to $9000 was too low for me. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $9250?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8200.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $9000 was too low, $9250 was too low, and $9000 was too low, so I will offer $9000 + 250 = $9250 was too low, so I will offer $9250 - 50 = $9200?",9200.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you a discount of $300 from the previous offer, which would put the price at $8900. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",8900.0,Alice,9,

"I'm sorry, but I think we're getting too close to the price I'm willing to pay. I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I think I'll go talk to John and see what he's willing to offer.",0.0,Bob,10,
