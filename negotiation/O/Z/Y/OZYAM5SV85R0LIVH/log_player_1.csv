Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. If Bob rejects it, we can negotiate further. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm prepared to negotiate further.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm willing to lower my price to $17,500. This is still a good profit for me and shows I'm open to negotiation. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my initial asking price, and it's worth the risk of missing out on a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
