"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  I think $1,050,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get. I'll counter again, hoping to get a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant amount of money for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's value for the product. I'm hoping he sees it the same way and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $900,000 is getting closer to John's offer, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to make a final attempt to meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm dropping my price to $975,000.  This is a good compromise, and I hope Bob sees it as such. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer barely exceeding John's, it's time to cut my losses.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John for $800,000 is the best course of action at this point."
