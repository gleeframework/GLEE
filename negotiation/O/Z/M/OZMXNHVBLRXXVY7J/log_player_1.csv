Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and also allows for a fair margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
