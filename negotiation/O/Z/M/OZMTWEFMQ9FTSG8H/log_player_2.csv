"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's value ($100) to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Engaging:** I want to maintain a positive tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $120 is still a significant markup from Alice's value. There's room to negotiate further and try to get a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Alice came down to $120. Offering $110 splits the difference and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Asserting Fairness:**  By framing $110 as a ""fair price,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around that number. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** It's still important to be polite and appreciative to increase the chances of a successful outcome."
