"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $1200000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
