"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a strong starting point and allows for potential negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than the $1,500,000 I could get from John, so I'm aiming for a better deal.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'm still confident the product is worth more to Bob, and I have several rounds to negotiate. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above what I could get from John. I'm aiming for a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and  a good deal considering the time spent on negotiation.  I'm also aware that I only have 10 rounds to close a deal, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds. Additionally, if I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away, and I might end up having to sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's a calculated risk, but for now, I'm taking the $1,400,000."
