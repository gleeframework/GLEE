"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a positive tone and express continued interest in the product.
* **Anchoring:** We're aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. This initial lowball offer gives us room to negotiate upwards while still likely staying below our $100 maximum.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By leaving a significant gap between our offer and Alice's, we encourage her to propose a counter-offer, hopefully moving closer to a price we both find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $75. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better, we're still aiming lower. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows for further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $75 is closer, but I'm hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly.  How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

Here's our strategy:

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Alice's compromise, showing we're participating in good faith.
* **Gradual Increase:** We move our offer up slightly, demonstrating willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Reasoning:** We reiterate our budget concerns, subtly reminding Alice we have other options.
* **Target Price:** $70 is a good target for this stage. It's a significant saving from the initial offer while still leaving some room for a final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $72.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and $72.50 is a reasonable price. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to settle for John's $100 price."
