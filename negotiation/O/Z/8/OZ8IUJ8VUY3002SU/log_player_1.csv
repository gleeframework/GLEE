Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation before reaching Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000).
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  A high initial offer gives me space to come down in subsequent counteroffers, showing flexibility and potentially encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm setting a psychological anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offer might be closer to my desired range than if I had started lower.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John. This knowledge gives me leverage to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches my absolute minimum and leaves no room for negotiation. While I could accept and close the deal, I believe there's still a chance to secure a better price. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a middle ground between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. It seems we both see the value in this product, but our valuations differ. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This recognizes its worth while offering you a significant saving compared to your perceived value."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise. It's exactly halfway between my initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counter-offer ($1,200,000). 
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes that this price represents a substantial discount for Bob compared to what he believes the product is worth.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not drastically reducing my price. I'm signaling that I believe in the value of my product and am seeking a fair deal. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I'm still aware of my alternative with John, giving me the confidence to walk away if Bob remains unwilling to move significantly from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Compromise:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant improvement from his initial $1,200,000. It's closer to my minimum but still provides a $50,000 profit margin. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gains are shrinking. I risk pushing Bob away entirely, leaving me with John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now puts the cash in my hand sooner, allowing me to potentially reinvest it. Prolonged negotiations delay this benefit. 

Overall, while I could aim for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at $1,250,000 represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal in a timely manner."
