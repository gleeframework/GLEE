Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a good compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob, but I'm not willing to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore that possibility before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise and demonstrates my willingness to work with Bob. I believe it's a good offer for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  The risk of continuing negotiations and possibly reaching an impasse is too high, especially with a guaranteed buyer like John offering my minimum acceptable price.  I'm better off selling to John now and ensuring my profit margin is secure."
