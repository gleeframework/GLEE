"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a deal closer to his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a strong opening move, likely to prompt Alice to consider lowering her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. He's willing to pay $1,000,000, and this offer is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to try to secure a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected a price of $1,100,000, so he's looking to get closer to his maximum budget of $1,000,000. A counteroffer of $1,075,000 shows willingness to negotiate but still pushes for a lower price. This approach aims to find a middle ground acceptable to both parties."
