"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Demeanor:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in it. This sets a positive tone while still being firm on the initial high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, I aim to:
    * Anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.
    * Potentially close the deal quickly if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
    * Give myself room to negotiate downwards in later rounds while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy is about maximizing my potential profit while keeping the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000 open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below my target price.  I believe there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price and force Bob to either improve his offer significantly or risk losing the deal.  I'm willing to leverage my alternative offer from John to maintain a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is moving in the right direction,  I'm looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price, but not drastically. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a good deal. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing makes the offer seem fair and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly sized concession. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's initial offer and my guaranteed sale price with John.  This keeps the pressure on Bob while leaving me with options if he doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,600,000 is a fairer price for the product. I'm willing to pay that amount 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the price lower, but his offer of $1,600,000 is still too close to my fallback option with John.  There's not enough incentive for me to accept this offer yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better price. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory offer, which might push Bob to be more aggressive in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is considerably less than what I had in mind.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need you to understand this product is exceptionally valuable. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm pushing back on Bob's attempt to lowball me, making it clear that his previous offer was unacceptable. However, I'm also emphasizing my willingness to be fair and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm dropping my price again but by a smaller amount ($100,000). This signals flexibility but also that I'm reaching the limits of what I'm willing to accept.
* **High Anchoring:**  By reiterating the product's value and offering a price of $1,900,000, I'm trying to keep the negotiation anchored closer to my earlier offers, hoping Bob will make a significant move upward.

This round is crucial. Bob's response will reveal how serious he is about purchasing the product and how much negotiating power I have left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,700,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay that amount 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time to be pragmatic. Bob has incrementally increased his offer to $1,700,000. While it's not ideal, it's a significant profit above my guaranteed offer from John.  

Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller concessions from Bob. We're likely reaching a point where the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round we spend negotiating is a round closer to my deadline.  Securing a good offer now eliminates uncertainty and allows me to move forward.
* **Solid Profit:**  $1,700,000 is a strong return. It's easy to get fixated on an ideal price, but sometimes a good deal in hand is better than the possibility of a slightly better deal that might not materialize."
