"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is moving in the right direction,  I'm looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is considerably less than what I had in mind.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need you to understand this product is exceptionally valuable. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
