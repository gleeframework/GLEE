"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,450,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
