"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This gives us both a fair price.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to drop to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we revisit the $12,500 price point, and I'll throw in a 1-year warranty, which normally costs $500? This way, you'll get the full value of the product, and I'll get the price I'm looking for.",12500.0,Bob,6,
