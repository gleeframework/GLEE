"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and show that I'm open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids further potential losses."
