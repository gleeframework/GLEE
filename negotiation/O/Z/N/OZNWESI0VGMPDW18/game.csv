"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $825,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a revised price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
