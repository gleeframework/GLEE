"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $825,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a revised price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000, but it's a significant improvement from the previous offer.  It's closer to Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely or ending up with a worse outcome.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
