{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on my understanding of its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing it further.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation,  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I know it holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1400000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  his offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. At this point, it's more profitable to sell to John for $1,500,000."
