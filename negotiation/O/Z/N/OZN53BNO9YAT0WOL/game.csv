"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1750000.  This is a fair price considering the value I know it holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1400000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
