Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be even more valuable than Bob thinks.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, giving you a strong position. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to engage further.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  If he outright rejects the price, you can gauge his seriousness and potentially lower it slightly. However, never go below your $1,500,000 minimum as you have John as a secure alternative."
