"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer, but it allows me to explore the potential value Bob sees in the product. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate from this starting point. If not, I can always fall back on the $800,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a fair offer and the guaranteed value from John, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. There's no harm in pushing for a slightly higher offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. While I was aiming for a higher price, it's closer to my minimum threshold and securing the sale is important.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that may lead to a lower price or the potential of Bob backing out."
