,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is unfortunately below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll save us both some time.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
