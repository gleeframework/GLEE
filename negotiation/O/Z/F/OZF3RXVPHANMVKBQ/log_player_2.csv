(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $12,000. There's no chance I'll accept it.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price. This lets Alice know I'm serious about buying the product but won't go higher. If she rejects this, I'll likely go to John."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of finding a price we can both agree on. I'm not ready to buy from John just yet, as I still have rounds left to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  This is still a significant discount from her last offer, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. It's tempting to accept, but I'm determined to save as much as possible.  I'll continue to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a better price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I still have several rounds left to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to meet her halfway. If she rejects this offer, I'll be close to my limit and may have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too high. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if we can find a middle ground.  I have a few more rounds to try, and I'm not yet ready to give up on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. It's a significant compromise from Alice's offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. If she rejects this, I will need to seriously consider buying from John, as I'm running out of negotiating room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my maximum price, but I'm only one round away from having to buy from John. I'm not willing to risk another round with Alice, as it's unlikely she'll drop her price further. Buying from John ensures I get the product for my maximum budget and avoids the risk of missing out on the product altogether."
