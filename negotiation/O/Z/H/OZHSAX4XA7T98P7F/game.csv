"Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a significant discount on its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects my desire for a fair deal while acknowledging the value it holds for you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we try $1,150,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go much higher than that.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,190,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
