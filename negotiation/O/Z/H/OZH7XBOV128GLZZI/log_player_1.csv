{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product and aren't afraid to ask for a fair price.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still worth pushing for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my ideal price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,225,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,225,000. How about we meet in the middle again, at $1,212,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,212,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,212,500 is very close to my ideal price. While I could potentially continue negotiating and maybe get a bit more, the risk of losing the deal to Bob or having to sell to John for a much lower price is too high.  This is a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it."
