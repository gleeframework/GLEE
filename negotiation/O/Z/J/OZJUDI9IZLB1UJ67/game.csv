"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $900,000, which is a fair price considering its potential worth. I know you're a shrewd businessman, so I'm confident we can reach an agreement. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I truly believe this product is perfect for your company.",900000.0,Alice,1,
