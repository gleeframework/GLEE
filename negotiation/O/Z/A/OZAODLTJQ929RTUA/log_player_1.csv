Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is more than fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. We don't *have* to go below that price. 

**Why this is better than offering $1,500,000 directly:**

* Bob might be suspicious if you offer it at his exact perceived value.
* There's no room for negotiation, which is a natural part of the buying process."
