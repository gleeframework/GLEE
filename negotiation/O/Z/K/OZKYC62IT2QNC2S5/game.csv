"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $1,000,000? That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value our negotiation and appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go to $975,000. This price offers you a significant advantage, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
