Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and includes the price for clarity.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By not going too high, I'm inviting Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation. 
* **Knowing My Floor:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I won't accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Even though it's closer to my floor, I still have room to negotiate with Bob, potentially getting a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Selling to John is always an option, but I want to try to maximize my profit with Bob.

I'll counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $1,400,000? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not conceding too much. I'm aiming for a compromise that keeps the price within the negotiation range. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth while also emphasizing that I'm open to compromise. 
* **Maintaining my bottom line:** I'm still well above my minimum price, making sure I get a fair return for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  Would you consider $1,350,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might back out entirely, or his counter-offers might drop below my minimum.
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate could take a lot of time and effort, and I could potentially lose the sale to John if I stall too long.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, even if it's not the highest possible price."
