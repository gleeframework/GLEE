"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-end product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm looking for $25000 for it. Would you be interested in making an offer?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18000 is still above my budget. Would you consider $10000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $14000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12000? I believe this price is reasonable for both of us, and it's the most I can offer at this point.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept $12000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. I'm offering $11000.  This is a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,9,
