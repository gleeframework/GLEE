"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-end product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm looking for $25000 for it. Would you be interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $25,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first, but if that fails, he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $25,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still significantly higher than his ideal price. Since he can secure the same product from John for $8,000, it's more logical to continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,000 is still above my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $14000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to his ideal price, he can still get the same product from John for $8,000. With a few more rounds of negotiation, Bob might be able to get Alice to drop her price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,000? I believe this price is reasonable for both of us, and it's the most I can offer at this point."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept $12000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still too high for him. He has a secure alternative with John for $8,000. He can continue negotiating with Alice in the hopes of getting a better deal, but if it doesn't work out, he has a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. I'm offering $11,000.  This is a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. He has already spent several rounds trying to negotiate with Alice, and it seems unlikely that she will come down to a price he's willing to pay.  With only one round left, it's more practical to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
