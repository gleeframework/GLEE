Considering my valuation and budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with a fair transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While $750,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $850,000, which is a fair middle ground considering our valuations.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
