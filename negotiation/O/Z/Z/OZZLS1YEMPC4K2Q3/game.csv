"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. Can you consider a price of $112? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,4,
