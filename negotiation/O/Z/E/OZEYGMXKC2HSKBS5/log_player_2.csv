"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $12,000 is still a significant amount. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You want to save as much money as possible, and you have 10 rounds to do so. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If the negotiation fails, you can always get the product from John, but it's not the ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:**  A significant drop from Alice's initial offer shows your intent to negotiate seriously.
* **Reasonable but not too low:**  $10,000 is still a good profit for Alice, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While $11,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. 
* **Room for further compromise:**  There's still room for negotiation, and you're only in Round 3.  There's no need to rush into an agreement yet.
* **Buying from John is still a backup:** You have time to continue negotiating and see if you can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying below Alice's last offer.
* **Testing the waters:**  By increasing the offer by a small amount, you can gauge Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to meet you halfway.
* **Staying within your budget:**  $10,500 is still well within your budget, allowing you to potentially close the deal without going too high."

* **Alice has met your counteroffer.** This means she's willing to compromise and come down to a price you're comfortable with. 
* **You're saving $4,500.**  Accepting the offer saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John.
* **Time is a factor.**  While there are still more rounds, you don't want to risk losing the deal by being overly ambitious."
