"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a starting price of $1500000. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800000 is a starting point, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1200000.  This gives us both some room to negotiate, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still a significant distance from my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for me, while also being within a reasonable range for your budget. I'm open to further negotiation, but this is my final offer before considering other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
