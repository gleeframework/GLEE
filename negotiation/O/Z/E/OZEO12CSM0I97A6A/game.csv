,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $60. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price considering its value.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $85. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stick to my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
