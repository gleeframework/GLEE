Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal for something worth over a million to me.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the high value I place on the product to make the price seem more justifiable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is positive and inviting, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit. 
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* **Negotiations Stall:** If negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is interested, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Not Worth Risking:** Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a sure thing, but I'm willing to see if I can do better with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $875,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint Offer:**  The $875,000 price is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, indicating a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both of us, making it more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Excellent! We have a deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or make another counteroffer.
* **Negotiations Stall:** If we can't reach an agreement, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000, so how about $862,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  Even though Bob has come up to $862,500, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential to Improve:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price this low just yet. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll likely offer a price slightly above his current offer, but still below my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $862,500 is still a bit low for me. How about $868,750? This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 868750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm only going down a small amount, signaling that I'm still holding firm on my desired price range.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both of us, making it more appealing. I'm suggesting that this offer represents a fair compromise and a good opportunity for both parties.
* **Finality:** I'm hinting that this might be my final offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Fantastic! We have a deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to seriously consider my options.  His offer is closer to my acceptable range, but selling to John is still a guaranteed profit.  I'll weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate against the security of the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $868,750 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous ones, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price or prolonging the process. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a secure and profitable outcome.

**Decision:**  I've reached a point where the potential gains from continued negotiation with Bob don't outweigh the certainty and profitability of selling to John."
