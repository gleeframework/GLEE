Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $120 but leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It's also important to be friendly and positive, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum price of $120, and it's likely that I can't get a better price.  Selling to John would only yield $120.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit."
