Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob's $10,000 valuation leaves room for negotiation.
* **Create Urgency:** Offering a ""first chance"" can encourage Bob to act quickly before he loses the opportunity.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,500 is the initial offer, there might be space to negotiate slightly downward if Bob hesitates but still seems interested. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice cannot reveal John's guaranteed $12,000 offer to influence Bob's decision."
