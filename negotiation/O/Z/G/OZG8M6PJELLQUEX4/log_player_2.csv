"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still aiming to pay closer to $6,000. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $6,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go below $8,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $7,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $7,000. This is a good price and significantly lower than her initial offer.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and waiting could risk losing the deal."
