"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference and I'll accept $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $925,000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $925,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about $940,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $920,000. Can you consider that?",920000.0,Bob,6,
