Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'd be willing to offer you $1,300,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
