Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's significantly less than its value to you, and it's a good profit for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below Bob's value, but still gives me a decent profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I can always fall back to John's offer of $10,000 if necessary."
