{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident I can get at least my minimum of $12,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $16,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,500 is a good deal and higher than what I'd get from John."
