"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount considering the product's value. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
