# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for the best value possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could continue to negotiate, Alice's offer is very close to his ideal price and a much better deal than buying from John."
