Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would bring significant value to your operations, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This offer stands only for a limited time."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, Alice needs to aim for a price higher than that to maximize her profit from Bob.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) makes it a tempting deal. A price of $1,190,000 gives Bob a potential $10,000 in perceived value.
* **Urgency:** By adding a time constraint (""limited time""), Alice encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out on what he might perceive as a good deal."
