"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,600,000? This is a fair price considering the value I know you'll get out of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,500,000.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,550,000?  This gives us both a good deal and ensures I can meet my minimum price.  Let's make this happen!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
