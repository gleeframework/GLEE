Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before I resort to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,600,000? This is a fair price considering the value I know you'll get out of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more before resorting to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,500,000.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,550,000?  This gives us both a good deal and ensures I can meet my minimum price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,450,000 is a more reasonable price for me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are becoming unproductive.  John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I'm getting the best deal possible."
