{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's much too early to accept Alice's offer. You have a lot of room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save a lot of money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 200000}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $200,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point considering my maximum budget is $800,000.  I'm aiming to see how strongly Alice is committed to this price and potentially start a negotiation that will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and continue trying to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $250,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product.  Hopefully, Alice will see it as a good deal and accept it."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her last offer with a counteroffer of $300,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a successful deal in the next few rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has gone back to her original offer. While it's tempting to consider, I want to see if I can still push for a better deal.  I'll reject her offer and see if she's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 325000}
```

I'm going to raise my counteroffer slightly to $325,000.  This is a small step up from my previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's price.  I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to overpay."

Alice's offer is getting higher, and we're running out of time.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000."
