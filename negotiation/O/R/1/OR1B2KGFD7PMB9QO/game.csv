"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $600,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's below your perceived value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $750,000. It shows you're serious about this. However, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  Would you consider $900,000? It's a compromise that lets me move closer to what I need, and you'd still be getting a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,5,
