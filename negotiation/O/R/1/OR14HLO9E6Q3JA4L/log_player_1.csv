"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and makes the negotiation feel less adversarial.
* **Focus on benefits:**  I emphasize that it's a ""great deal"" for both of us, highlighting potential benefits to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which is a good backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize that $10,500 is still a ""good deal"" for Bob.
* **Maintain my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,750? That's a significant step towards your price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, there's still some wiggle room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a good fallback:** If I can't reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making a real effort to find common ground.  While $9,750 is getting closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate by reducing my price again.
* **Highlighting progress:**  I emphasize that Bob's offer is getting closer, showing I'm taking his concerns seriously.
* **Fair compromise:**  I propose a price that is still above my minimum but acknowledges Bob's budget constraints.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers?  Would you be willing to sell for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** There's very little room for further negotiation.  Bob has already made several concessions.
* **Risk of losing a sale:** If I reject this offer, I risk losing the sale to Bob and having to sell to John for $12,000.
* **Quick close:**  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and minimize the risk of further negotiation."
