"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm happy to hear you're interested. While $12000 is definitely closer to where I'd like to be, I'd be willing to come down to $13500. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit on the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its unique value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $13500. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
