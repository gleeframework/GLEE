Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a strong opening offer, leaving some room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 as possible, but leaving a buffer in case of counteroffers."

While Bob's offer is close to my initial offer, I believe I can still get a slightly better price.  I will counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Bob's offer is close to my desired price and it's clear that we're not far apart in our valuation.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or even having to sell to John for a lower price."
