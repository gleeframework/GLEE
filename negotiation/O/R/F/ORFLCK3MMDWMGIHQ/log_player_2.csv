"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product from John for significantly less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,500? This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,500 is still too high for Bob, who is only willing to pay $8,000.  It's better to keep negotiating with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,500 is still above my budget.  I'm serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's make this simpler: $13,000, and we have a deal.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While he could keep negotiating with Alice, she's indicating that $13,000 is her bottom line. That's still too high for Bob, who is determined to pay no more than $8,000.  He's better off buying from John to get the product at his desired price point."
