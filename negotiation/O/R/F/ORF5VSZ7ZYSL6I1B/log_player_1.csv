Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  It also reflects the fact that I know the product is worth more to him than to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is more than John's offer, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, and we've been going back and forth without much movement.  At this point, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  This ensures a quick sale and guarantees me a profit."
