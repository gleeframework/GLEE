"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price, $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also demonstrating the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm willing to risk a rejection in hopes of securing a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this shows my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,700,000. It's a good price and I'm happy to close the deal."
