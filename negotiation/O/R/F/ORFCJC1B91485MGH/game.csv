How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This price reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to pay $950000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and stays within my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
