Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your portfolio. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a friendly and optimistic tone can help build rapport with Bob. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the product's potential benefits for Bob can make him more interested in buying. 

This offer is a starting point. I'll need to adjust based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1500000 is way above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair price. 

I'll counter with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer. This will demonstrate flexibility while still aiming for a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000). 
* **Maintaining a fair price:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, so it's a good deal for me.
* **Expressing flexibility:**  My message highlights that I'm open to negotiation and want to find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Encouraging a response:**  Ending with a question prompts Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to pay $950000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and stays within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a good return on my product.  
* **Risk of continued negotiation:**  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, as he may not be willing to budge much higher.  There's also the risk of a long and drawn-out negotiation process.

I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John. I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future if I need to."
