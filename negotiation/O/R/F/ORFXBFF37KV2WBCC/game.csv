"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would still represent a significant value for you and would allow me to secure a fair price for my product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
