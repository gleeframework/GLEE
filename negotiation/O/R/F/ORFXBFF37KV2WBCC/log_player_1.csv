{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing, as it's still below the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to secure a price that reflects the true value of the product.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would still represent a significant value for you and would allow me to secure a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
