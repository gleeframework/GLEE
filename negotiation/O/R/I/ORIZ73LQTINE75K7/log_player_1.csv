"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a little. I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, I believe I can get a better price from Bob with more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm running out of rounds, so I'm willing to take a small hit to close the deal with Bob, rather than risk losing out and having to settle with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell to John for $10,000.  I'm running out of time and there is little chance Bob will increase his offer further. While I'd prefer to make more money, I'm happy to get my minimum price and avoid further risk."
