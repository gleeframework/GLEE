"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,500,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000

Since you have a guaranteed alternative at the same price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. By rejecting, you can potentially negotiate a better price with John or explore other options."
