"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how Alice responds and understand her bottom line. This leaves us with room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to her bottom line, but $85 is still too high. We should continue negotiating and aim for a price closer to $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 might be pushing it a little. How about $78? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

We are moving closer to a price point that could be agreeable for both parties. We acknowledge Alice's position while still aiming for a price that benefits us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me. $78 is still a bit low.  How about $82? It's only $4 more than your last offer, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could potentially push for a slightly lower price, $82 is a reasonable compromise.  Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and we're still getting a good deal compared to John's price of $100. It's best to accept now and avoid the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
