"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point and lets me see how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  There are still 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $175. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $165. While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, this is a good compromise. I'm getting more than my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
