Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Lower than your minimum:** This ensures you still profit while leaving room for potential counteroffers. 
* **A clear offer:** It leaves no room for ambiguity and sets the stage for a straightforward negotiation. 

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, you encourage him to engage in a negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer. This strategy increases your chances of getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range through further negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
