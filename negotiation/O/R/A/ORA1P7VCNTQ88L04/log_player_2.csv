"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This remarkable item holds significant value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you is even greater. I am offering it to you at a special price tailored to reflect its importance to both of us.

Considering the immense value this product could bring to you, I propose a transaction price of $900,000. This offer represents a substantial discount compared to its intrinsic value and provides you with a unique chance to secure a valuable asset at a highly favorable rate.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and financial considerations. I am eager to discuss further details and explore the possibility of making this transaction a reality.

Best regards,
Alice
