"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation below your $10,000 maximum. By rejecting the offer, you signal that the price is unacceptable and open the door for a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer that aligns with Alice's product valuation sets a strong anchoring point for the negotiation.  It's a significant drop from her initial offer but still within a reasonable range for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved towards your price, $8,750 is still a significant amount above her own valuation.  There's likely room for further negotiation. A rejection here keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer, but $8,750 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $8,250?"", 
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're moving in smaller increments now, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation. Offering $8,250 keeps the negotiation active and gives Alice something to consider."
