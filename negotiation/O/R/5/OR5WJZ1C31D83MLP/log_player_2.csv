"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable item for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit by overvaluing the product based on your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This might make her propose a lower price. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $1,200,000, which is your upper limit anyway."
