"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire a truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a fruitful negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high for my budget. I need to negotiate a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay  $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while allowing for some profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair value in my eyes, I understand you have a different perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This represents a significant compromise from my initial ask. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  While she's moved closer to my counteroffer, it's still above my budget.  I'll counter again to try and get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your compromise, $1,100,000 is still beyond my limit.  Let's try $950,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
