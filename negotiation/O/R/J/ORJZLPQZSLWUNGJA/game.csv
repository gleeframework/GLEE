"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay  $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while allowing for some profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair value in my eyes, I understand you have a different perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This represents a significant compromise from my initial ask.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your compromise, $1,100,000 is still beyond my limit.  Let's try $950,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
