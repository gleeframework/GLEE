"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value we both see in this opportunity.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I know the product holds.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1150000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to offer $1050000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not budging from that price. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
