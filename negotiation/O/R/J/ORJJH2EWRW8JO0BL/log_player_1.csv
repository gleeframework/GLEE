# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value we both see in this opportunity.
