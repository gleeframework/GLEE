"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true worth to me, and offers you a good return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also have to make sure I get a fair price for something that's worth significantly more to me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,112,500? This price gives us both a solid return on our investment and allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think we can do better than $1,112,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,112,500, which would be $1,093,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it.",1093750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,093,750 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,103,125?  This is a reasonable compromise, and we can finally finalize the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1103125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,103,125, which would be $1,089,062.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it.",1089062.5,Bob,6,
