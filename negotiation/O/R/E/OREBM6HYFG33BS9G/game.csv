"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to make an effort to get this product. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,500 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by reducing the price from $9,000 to $8,500 and now to $8,000 is not possible for me. How about we meet at $8,250? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be totally transparent, my budget for this is quite tight, and $8,250 is a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $7,750? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I've already reduced the price by $1,250 from the original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,250 and $7,750, which would be $8,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,7,
