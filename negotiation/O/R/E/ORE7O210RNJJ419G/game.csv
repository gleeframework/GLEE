"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  I think it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $90? It's still a great price for you, and a fair deal for me. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $87.50 is still a little low for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating. Let's split the difference and go with $88.50.  How does that sound?",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $88.50 is still a bit too high. How about we go to $86.25? I'm really interested in buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",86.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $87.00?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",87.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $86.00? I'm willing to make a final concession to get the deal done.",86.0,Bob,8,
