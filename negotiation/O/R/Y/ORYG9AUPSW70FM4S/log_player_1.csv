Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $10,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get significantly more from Bob.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
