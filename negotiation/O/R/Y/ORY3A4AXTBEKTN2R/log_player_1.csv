Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate him coming up to $8,750, it's still not close enough to my desired price point. I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 as a final compromise.
