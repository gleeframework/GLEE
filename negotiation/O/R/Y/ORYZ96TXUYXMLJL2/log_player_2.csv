{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still not ideal.**  While $950,000 is less than $1,200,000, Bob can likely do better.
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of negotiating further with Alice or finding a better deal elsewhere."
