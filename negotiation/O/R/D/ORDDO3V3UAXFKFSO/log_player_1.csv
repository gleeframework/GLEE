"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  Selling to John right now guarantees me $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's important to remember that while I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.  At this point, accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum I'm comfortable with.  It's also important to note that selling to John would result in the same price. However, I believe that a direct sale to Bob would be more beneficial as it can potentially lead to a longer-term relationship."
