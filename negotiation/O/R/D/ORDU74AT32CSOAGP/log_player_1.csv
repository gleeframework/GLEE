Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit. 
* **Anchoring:**  By suggesting $120, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he negotiates down, it's less likely he'll go as low as $80.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
