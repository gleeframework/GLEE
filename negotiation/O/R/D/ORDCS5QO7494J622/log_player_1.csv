"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm ready to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than $80, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to go down to $105 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than $80, I'm confident that I can still get closer to my desired price of $110 or $120. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $110. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to go down to $105 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is not my ideal price, I've reached the point where the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is not worth it. If I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away entirely. It's also likely that we'll keep going back and forth, which will take up valuable time. Selling to John for $80 is my fallback option, but I'd rather get the slightly higher price from Bob."
