"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it might be slightly above what I'm comfortable with. Could we aim for $10500? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring such a unique item.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $11200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's uniqueness and quality.",11200.0,Alice,5,
