Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant amount for Bob, but still lower than the value he places on the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Avoiding the fallback option:**  While John is a guaranteed $8,000, there's a chance I can get closer to the product's worth to me ($12,000) if I negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price of $8,000, I believe I can still do better. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price, potentially getting closer to the $10,000 I initially proposed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $9,750 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Signal of flexibility:**  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining value:**  This price still leaves me a significant margin over my minimum selling price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the target:** Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my desired price point, only $400 away from my initial offer of $10,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could try to squeeze out another few hundred dollars, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with the lower offer from John. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  The time spent negotiating further may not be worth the potential gain of a few hundred dollars. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
