Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We're willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price point closer to $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's make this work. How about we settle at $1,825,000? This offer reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your position."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,650,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly jumped down in his offer, indicating he's getting impatient.  While $1,650,000 is tempting, we're still losing a considerable amount compared to John's offer. We'll hold firm for now, signaling that we're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront – that price point is too low for me to consider.  The value this product offers is substantial, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment.  I'm willing to accept $1,750,000 - that's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the point where further negotiation with Bob might not be beneficial.  By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and give Bob a chance to make a strong final counter-offer. This price also keeps us comfortably above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,725,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed to negotiating, but his increments are getting smaller. Accepting $1,725,000 is a good deal – it's a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with no guarantee of a better outcome."
