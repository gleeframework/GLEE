"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $12000 to me, and I know you're in the market for something like this. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great deal for both of us, so let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $12000. ",12500.0,Alice,1,
