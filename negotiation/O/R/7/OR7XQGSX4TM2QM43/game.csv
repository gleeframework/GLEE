"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves a good profit margin for you. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I understand if it's not the right fit for you at this time. Just let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
