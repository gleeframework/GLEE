"I understand you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I need to get closer to my target price.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not getting close enough to my target price.

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $11,400. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",11400.0,Bob,10,
