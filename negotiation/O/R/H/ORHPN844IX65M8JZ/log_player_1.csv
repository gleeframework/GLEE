Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, a price reflecting its true worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above $800,000 (his perceived value).
* **Strong Language:**  Using confident language emphasizes the product's value and encourages Bob to seriously consider the offer.

**Why not ask for the full $1,000,000?**

While tempting, it leaves no room for negotiation and could make Bob immediately walk away. Aiming slightly lower increases the chance of securing a deal with Bob at a price still significantly higher than his perceived value."
