Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so this gives me a chance to see if he's interested and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's a more reasonable compromise than Bob's offer of $8,000.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to give away the product for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to justify continuing the negotiation. John is willing to pay $10,000, which is a better deal for me. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale and avoid risking further negotiation with Bob."
