Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it quickly and avoid any potential bidding wars."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting a limited-time offer and potential competition can encourage Bob to act quickly.

This offer aims to secure a significant profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
