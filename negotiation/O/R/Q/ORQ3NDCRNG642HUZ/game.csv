"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price given the value of the product to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,600. Would that be agreeable to you?",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  While $10,600 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my ideal price.  Would you consider $10,800? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,
