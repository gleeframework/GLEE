"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1200000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the best I can do at this point. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we try $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $1,400,000. I'm confident the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to hold firm on this price. What's your next move?",1400000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm sensing some resistance on your end.  While I value the product, $1,400,000 is pushing my absolute limit. To be completely transparent, I can get this for $1,500,000 from another seller.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. That's my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I understand you've got other options, but I'm not willing to let this deal slip away. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, which is still below the product's true value to you. I'm confident we can make this work. What's your next move?",1450000.0,Alice,7,,
