Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly and open message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" and emphasizing the product's value subtly pushes Bob towards accepting a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've earned a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  I'll always have John as a backup buyer to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  While $85 is close to my minimum of $80, I still have room for improvement. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejection allows me to continue negotiating with Bob. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John right now would net me $80, but I'm hoping to earn more. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'll need to consider how much I want to push the negotiation and what kind of compromise I'm willing to make."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $92.50.  This still allows me to make a fair profit, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Profit:**  $92.50 is still a good profit for me, but it's also closer to Bob's offer, increasing the chances of acceptance.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, making it more likely that Bob will see the offer as a positive outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer carefully and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering your offer, I would like to propose $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  $90 is very close to my desired price of $92.50.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $80. 
* **Time Factor:**  It's unclear how much time I have to negotiate, and prolonging the process might not be worthwhile.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the Offer:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This guarantees a good profit and avoids any further negotiation risks."
