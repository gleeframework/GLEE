Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, Alice knows it's worth $15,000 to her (and she has a guaranteed buyer at that price). It makes sense to start high to test Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price (""exclusive opportunity"", ""value"") can make it seem more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, even if it's unlikely he'll reach Alice's minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything, as she can sell to John at her desired price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's essential to consider the potential impact on the relationship with Bob. A very high initial offer might deter him from future interactions."
