"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its field. I believe it could greatly benefit your business operations. Considering its value and the impact it can have, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a significant amount for me.  I believe this price reflects the product's value while allowing us to come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while reflecting the value we place on the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,500.  I truly believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while allowing us both to benefit from the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $9,500 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me while providing you with a competitive price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility.  How about we settle on $9,000?  This would be a good compromise and allow us to finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
