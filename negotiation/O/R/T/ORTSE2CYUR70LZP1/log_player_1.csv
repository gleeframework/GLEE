Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, but she also has a guaranteed sale at that price from John. This allows her to start with a significantly higher offer.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price leaves space for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still likely secure a price well above her minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This assumes Alice doesn't have deep insights into Bob's financial situation or negotiation style. More information could lead to a different approach.
* **Relationship:** If Alice wants to maintain a positive long-term relationship with Bob (even if he doesn't buy this time), a less aggressive starting point might be preferred."
