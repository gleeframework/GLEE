Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a profitable deal.
* **Value for Bob:** I'm acknowledging the product's value to Bob, suggesting he can gain significant value at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, using ""let me know if you're interested"" to encourage a response and further discussions. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will tell me if he's serious about buying.
* **Maximize Potential:**  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I can assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** The threat of selling to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Leverage:**  The threat of selling to John for $1,500,000 is my leverage in this negotiation.

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential benefit he'll gain.
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm using positive language (""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"") to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still above Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate but not underselling the product.
* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is serious about closing the deal or if he's simply trying to lowball me.
* **Set the Stage for Agreement:** By showing flexibility, I'm creating an environment where a mutually agreeable price is more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would still like to explore a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come back with a higher offer. I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could take time, and I might miss out on other opportunities. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice considering the potential risks and my own need for a quick sale."
