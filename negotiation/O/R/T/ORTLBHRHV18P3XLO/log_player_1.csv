"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10000. This aligns closely with your asking price and would allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate.  While I could potentially get a higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffers or me running out of rounds is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum desired price."
