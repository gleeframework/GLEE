``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000, even though it's lower than John's price.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price from Alice. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  This gives you the opportunity to push for a price closer to your target."

* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.** This keeps the door open for finding a more mutually beneficial price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $890,000. This price reflects a compromise that acknowledges your financial constraints while still providing a reasonable profit for us. I believe this could be a satisfactory solution for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $890,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **There's a significant savings compared to John.**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $310,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation may not yield a significant improvement.**  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price."
