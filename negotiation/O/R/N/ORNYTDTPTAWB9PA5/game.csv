"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a significant premium for you, considering your value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of this, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $900,000. This price reflects a compromise that maintains a high value for you, while also ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope we can find a solution that satisfies both parties.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget constraints. This offer represents a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
