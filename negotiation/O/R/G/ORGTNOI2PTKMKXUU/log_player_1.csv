Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to capture some of the surplus. 
* **Leaving Room:** $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and suggests a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for counteroffer:** I can still make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price and potentially reach a mutually agreeable deal. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $15,000 gives me confidence to continue negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great price for a product worth more. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Still above minimum:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm not selling at a loss.
* **Positive tone:** The message is positive and encourages further negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to make the price more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $10,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point and below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential to close the gap:** I can likely negotiate a better deal with a counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Having John's offer of $15,000 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,250. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Still above minimum:** $10,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm not losing money on the deal. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that the proposed price is fair for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm getting a bit worried that if we don't meet soon, I might have to consider buying from John for $8,000. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is better:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and might not lead to a significantly better price.  

Given that John is a guaranteed buyer offering a much higher price, it's more efficient and profitable to sell to John."
