"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great price for a product worth more. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm getting a bit worried that if we don't meet soon, I might have to consider buying from John for $8,000. Can you meet me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
