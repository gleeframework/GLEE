"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120.
* Alice is offering it for $100, which is a good price, but you can potentially do better.
* You have no information about how much Alice is willing to lower her price, so rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to explore the possibility of getting it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming to split the difference between my value ($120) and Alice's offer ($100). 
* This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save $10.
* I'm not pushing too hard in the first counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to my value, but is still below my maximum. 
*  At $110, I'm saving $10 compared to buying from John.
*  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting again and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
