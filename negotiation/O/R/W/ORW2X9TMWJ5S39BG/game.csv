"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
