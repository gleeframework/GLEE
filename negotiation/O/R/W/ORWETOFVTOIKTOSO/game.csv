"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and benefits to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle of $800,000 and $900,000, which would be $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your movement on the price. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $875,000, and we have a deal?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $875,000. How about we meet at $850,000 again, but this time I'll throw in some additional concessions on the deal?",850000.0,Bob,6,
