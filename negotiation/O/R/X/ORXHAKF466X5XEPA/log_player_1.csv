Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product and if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial price of $100. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that this price is attractive enough for him to accept, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum of $80, and it's closer to my desired price of $90. I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
