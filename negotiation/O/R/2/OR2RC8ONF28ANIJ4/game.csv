"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $11,000. Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully, we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $10,750. I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
