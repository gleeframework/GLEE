"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $100, and her offer is $120. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $90 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105? It's still a good price for you, and it gives us both a bit of room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $95 is closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay that amount. Let me know what you decide. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is your maximum budget and is the same price you could get from John.  There's no benefit to further negotiation as you're already at your limit.  It's a good deal for both of you."
