"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $90 at this time. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105? It's still a good price for you, and it gives us both a bit of room to work with.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $95 is closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay that amount. Let me know what you decide.",100.0,Alice,5,
