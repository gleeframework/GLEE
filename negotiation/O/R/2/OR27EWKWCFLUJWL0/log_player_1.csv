Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a backup buyer, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate further, and John provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I believe that's a fair deal considering the quality of the product."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate by moving down from your initial price. 
* **Aim High, but Reasonable:** $130 is still above your minimum, but closer to a potential agreement point. It allows for some further negotiation if needed. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the product's quality reinforces its value and justifies the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $110 is only $10 less than your safety net price with John. 
* **Avoid Risk:** Further negotiation could lead Bob to walk away, leaving you to sell to John at $120 anyway.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations for a relatively small gain."
