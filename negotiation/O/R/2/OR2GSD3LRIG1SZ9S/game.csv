"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly exceptional and worth every penny. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $15,000 for it. This offer includes not only the product itself but also a comprehensive support package to ensure you get the most out of it. I believe this is a fair deal given the product's worth and the benefits it offers. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  Given the value you've outlined, I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to secure a valuable item within my financial constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
