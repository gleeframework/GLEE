"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  Given the value you've outlined, I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to secure a valuable item within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
