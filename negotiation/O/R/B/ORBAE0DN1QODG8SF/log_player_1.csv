Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm sticking to my offer of $130. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

It's clear Bob is anchored at $130 and unlikely to budge significantly. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $150 offer."
