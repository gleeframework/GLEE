""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:** We have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **The Offer:** By offering the product at $14,000, we give Bob a potential savings of $2,000 compared to John's offer. This creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept while still securing a significant profit for us."
