"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I think the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a deal for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",11200.0,Alice,5,
