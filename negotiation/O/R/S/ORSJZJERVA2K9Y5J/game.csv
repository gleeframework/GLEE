"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe you'll find it valuable as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $850000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $875000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $875000. I'm willing to go up to $860000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. What do you think?",860000.0,Bob,4,
