Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  My starting price is $900,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  The product's value is significantly higher, and I need to recoup some of my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting this offer ensures I reach my target price, and I'm not risking losing the sale by trying to push for more."
