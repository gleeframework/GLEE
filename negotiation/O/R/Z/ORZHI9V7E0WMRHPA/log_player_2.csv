{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  $200 is far beyond my $80 limit. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also setting a clear limit.  $60 is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still staying well below Alice's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position that I'm not willing to pay a high price. $70 is closer to my limit, and I hope this will encourage Alice to come down further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my limit. I'm not willing to pay more than $80 for this product, so I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but also that I'm approaching my limit.  $75 is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's getting closer to my limit, I'm determined to get the best price possible. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm getting very close to my limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows a strong commitment to buying the product but also demonstrates I won't go over my $80 limit.  If Alice rejects this, I'll be ready to move to John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $162. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $162

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my limit. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't think she's willing to go lower.  It's more cost-effective to buy the product from John for $80 at this point. I've saved some money compared to Alice's offer, and I've avoided further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
