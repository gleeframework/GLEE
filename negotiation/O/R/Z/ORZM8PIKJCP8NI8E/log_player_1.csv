Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but gives him room to negotiate. I'm also leaving the door open to a counteroffer, as it's likely he won't accept the first offer. I'm confident in my ability to negotiate with him to reach a price that is mutually beneficial."
