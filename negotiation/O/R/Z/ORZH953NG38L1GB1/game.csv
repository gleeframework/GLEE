"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to go up to $12,500. If we can agree on that price, I'm ready to make the purchase.  ",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,250. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750.  This is a fair compromise given our both making concessions. Let me know your final decision.",12750.0,Bob,6,
