"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While $9,000 is better than $9,500, there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a lower price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle on $8,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a good price.  I'm willing to come down slightly more, but $8,750 is too low for me.  Would you consider $8,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Attractive:** $8,900 is significantly lower than John's price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** This is the 5th round of negotiation, and going further could lead to more back and forth without a guarantee of a better deal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might get frustrated and walk away from the negotiation.
* **Saving Money:** $8,900 is still a decent saving compared to both John's price and Alice's initial offer. 

By accepting this offer, Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or needing to negotiate further."
