Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below John's guaranteed purchase creates a sense of urgency and implies value exceeding Bob's initial perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message is firm, the slightly higher starting point allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his initial valuation, maximizing Alice's profit."
