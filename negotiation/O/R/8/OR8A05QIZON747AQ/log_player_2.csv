"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high, even for a high-quality item.  It's better to try and negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000. Let's make this happen, I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still closer to my goal of getting it for $10,000.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate further and close the gap even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and still represents a good value for you. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I think this is the lowest price I can offer and still make it worth my while to sell the product to you. Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. I'm willing to make one last concession to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  If I keep rejecting her offers, I risk running out of time and having to buy from Alice at a price higher than I want.  It's better to buy from John now and get the product at my desired price."
