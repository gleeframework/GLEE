"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between Alice's value of $80 and my maximum price of $100. This seems like a fair starting point for further negotiation, as it gives Alice some profit while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is getting closer to my maximum price of $100.  While there's still room for negotiation, I'm concerned that further rounds might lead to a price I'm not comfortable with, or it could drag out the process.  Buying from John for $100 guarantees I get the product at a price I'm willing to pay without the risk of further haggling."
