"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  This is his maximum price, so he should offer that to Alice. There is no reason to offer more, as he's already willing to buy for that price.  This also sets the negotiation starting point.  While Alice may not accept in this round, it establishes the price Bob is willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to inch closer to his target price, but not risk losing the deal entirely.  Offering $1,050,000 shows that he's willing to pay more than his minimum, but still has a limit.  This hopefully encourages Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for $1,080,000, which is within his budget and only slightly higher than John's offer.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he risks losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice in this round."
