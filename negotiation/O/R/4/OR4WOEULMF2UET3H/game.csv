"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $975,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $850,000. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're still a bit under my initial target, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"This is getting closer to what I had in mind, Alice. How about we settle at $910,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $910,000. I can meet you at $920,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,7,
