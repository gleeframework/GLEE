"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do better than that! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $11,800",11800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,800. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than $11,500 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $12,200?",12200.0,Alice,5,
