"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
