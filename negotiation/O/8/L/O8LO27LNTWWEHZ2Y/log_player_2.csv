# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his maximum value.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's price."
