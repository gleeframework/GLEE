**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to me ($800,000). I'm trying to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I can still do better. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a slightly lower price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $720,000 is only $80,000 less than the product's value to me.  At this point, further negotiation might take too much time, and I risk losing the deal to another buyer.  While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer is still a good value for me."
