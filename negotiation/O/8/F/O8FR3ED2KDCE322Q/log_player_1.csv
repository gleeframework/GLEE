Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful to you."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.

Offering the product at $119 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Incentive:** Bob gets the product for $19 less than its value to him ($100 value - $119 price = -$19 gain).
* **Alice's Profit:** Alice makes a profit of $19  ($119 price - $100 value = $19 profit), which is better than selling to John for $120. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
