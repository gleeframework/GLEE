"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm intrigued by the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your desired price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,120,000.
