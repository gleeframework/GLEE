"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $20,000. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a great value.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget.  I'm interested, but I can only consider a price closer to $5,000.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I can do $10,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $8,000, my absolute final offer.  It's a good price for the product, and I'm ready to make the deal happen today if you're agreeable.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,7,
