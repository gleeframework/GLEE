Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $750,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.
