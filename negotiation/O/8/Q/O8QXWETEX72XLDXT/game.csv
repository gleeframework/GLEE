"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $925,000. I really think this is a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $925,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a great price for the product, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,6,
