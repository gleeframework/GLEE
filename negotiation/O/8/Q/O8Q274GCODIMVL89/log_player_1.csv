Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11,900, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price considering you'd be saving on time and effort finding another buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900

While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, and he's indicated it's his final offer. Accepting avoids the risk of him walking away and having to settle for John's offer."
