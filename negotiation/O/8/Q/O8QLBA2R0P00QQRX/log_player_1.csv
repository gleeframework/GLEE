Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's still not my ideal price, it's a good profit and a significant increase from his previous offers.  It's getting late in the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely.  Accepting the offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of ending up with John's minimum price."
