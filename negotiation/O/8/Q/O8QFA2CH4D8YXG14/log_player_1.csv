Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value, aiming to establish a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think it's a great deal for both of us! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,250? This is still a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's safer and more efficient to sell to John for $10,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further back-and-forth negotiations."
