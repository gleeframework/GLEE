# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1200000 to $1300000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.
