"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1200000 to $1300000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1300000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This would allow me to cover my costs and still make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Given my current budget, I am comfortable with a price closer to $1250000. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. I look forward to your consideration of this counteroffer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
