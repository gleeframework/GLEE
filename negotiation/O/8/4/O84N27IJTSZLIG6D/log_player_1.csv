Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,100,000. I believe it presents significant value for you, and this offer stands as a testament to my commitment to our potential partnership."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting with a price closer to her own valuation ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates the perception of a discount while still aiming for a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a secure alternative with John, allowing her to confidently hold a firm stance in negotiations with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
