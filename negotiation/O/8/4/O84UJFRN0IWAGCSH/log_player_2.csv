**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $750,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for a potential compromise. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show Alice you're serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's important to weigh the potential savings against the risk of losing the opportunity.  At this point, accepting the offer and saving $75,000 seems like the best course of action."
