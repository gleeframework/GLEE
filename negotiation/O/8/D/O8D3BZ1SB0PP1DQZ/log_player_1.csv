Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This offer is a bit aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's above Bob's value, but below your minimum acceptable price, so it's a starting point to see if we can find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise - it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This counteroffer is my final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. It's just slightly lower than my previous offer and represents the maximum price I'm willing to go down to before potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I'm better off selling the product to John for my desired price.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result."
