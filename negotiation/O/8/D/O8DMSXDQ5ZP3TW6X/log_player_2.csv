Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still over Bob's budget.  It's time to try to negotiate further."

I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to the mark, the product's inherent value necessitates a higher price. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
