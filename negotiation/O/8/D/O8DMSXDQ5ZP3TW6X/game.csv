"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product but can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum price, but I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can realistically afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which reflects a fair compromise considering the value I see and my budget limitations. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to the mark, the product's inherent value necessitates a higher price. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a fair agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
