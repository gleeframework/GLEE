``` 

It's always good to try and negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she's truly interested in selling, she'll likely counter with something closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $850,000 is still a bit too high. Let's see if we can squeeze out a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm offering a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and my last one. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate without giving away too much."
