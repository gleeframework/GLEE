{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is just too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop the price to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,250. This is a very fair price considering its value. Let me know your final decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. She's consistently meeting in the middle, and her offers reflect that.  It's time to cut negotiations and buy from John for the guaranteed $8,000 price."
