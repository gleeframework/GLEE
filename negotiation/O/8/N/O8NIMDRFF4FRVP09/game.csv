"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is just too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop the price to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if you're interested!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,250. This is a very fair price considering its value. Let me know your final decision!",8250.0,Alice,5,
