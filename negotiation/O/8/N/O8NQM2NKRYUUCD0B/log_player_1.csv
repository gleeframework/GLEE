Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale of $150 with John. Therefore, she starts with a price closer to her guaranteed amount.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, giving Alice the opportunity to still make a profit above her minimum. 
* **Creating a Sense of Value:** By framing the price as ""special,"" Alice tries to entice Bob into thinking he's getting a better deal than he actually is.

This strategy allows Alice to maximize her potential earnings. If Bob accepts, she makes a significant profit. If Bob rejects the offer, she can still sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
