"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring the possibility of getting closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $11,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal attractive for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $11,500 is still outside your budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and push for a price closer to your limit. You still have several rounds to work with, and there's potential to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $11,250? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to go below $11,750. This is getting close to your budget, but there's a risk that the negotiations will drag on for several more rounds.  It's unlikely that Alice will drop to $11,000 in the remaining rounds, and buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price. It's better to secure the product now than to risk losing the opportunity to a lower price that may not materialize."
