"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $11,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal attractive for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $11,250? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let's make this deal happen!",11750.0,Alice,5,
