"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I can offer you a compromise at $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll make one more compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $13500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $13500, and you're still trying to get a better deal. I'm starting to think we're at an impasse. However, I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",13200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we've been negotiating for a while, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13200. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
