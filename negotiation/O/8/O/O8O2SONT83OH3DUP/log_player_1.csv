Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's incredibly valuable, but I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. This is a fantastic deal, as it's worth significantly more to the right buyer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's an opportunity to sell it to Bob for a slightly lower price and still make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""to the right buyer,"" I subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring the sale doesn't fall through, leading to a deal with John."
