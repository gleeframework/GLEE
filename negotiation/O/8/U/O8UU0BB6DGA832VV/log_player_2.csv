"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be a huge asset to your business.  I've priced it competitively at $1,200,000, reflecting its value and potential.  Let's discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000). 
* There's room for negotiation and potentially a much better deal.
* It's too early to buy from John, as we haven't even explored Alice's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, reflecting a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover my investment in this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
*  The price is still above the product's worth to Alice, which indicates there's potential for further compromise. 
* Buying from John is still too expensive compared to the potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair midpoint between our current positions.  This offer reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  $1,000,000 is closer, but still leaves a small gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This compromise demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now very close to a deal.
* While there's still room for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal entirely by rejecting the offer is high. 
* Accepting the offer at $1,050,000 saves a significant amount compared to buying from John at $1,500,000."
