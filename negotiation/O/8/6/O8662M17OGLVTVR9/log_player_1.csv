Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for the possibility of a quicker sale and still nets a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $1,150,000 offer is:
    * Substantially above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room to negotiate if needed.
    * Still attractive compared to your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A faster sale to Bob might be preferable, even with a slightly lower profit, as it avoids potential delays with John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" are common negotiation tactics to encourage a quicker decision."
