"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,500. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I believe the product is still worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my desired price point and is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
