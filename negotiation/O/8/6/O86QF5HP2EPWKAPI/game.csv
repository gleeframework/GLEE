"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it holds immense value for the right person. I'm asking for $1500000. This is a fair price considering the potential it offers, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to achieve a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a win-win scenario.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000 again, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
