"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $600,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a significant investment. To make this work, I could go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that's agreeable.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value the product will bring to your business.
