"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering your initial offer of $900000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the market value. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1025000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll propose $997500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the market value. I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",997500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $997500. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1015000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally meet in the middle. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
