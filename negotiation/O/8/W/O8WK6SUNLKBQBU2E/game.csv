"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,250,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute minimum.  This is a great product, and I believe this price is still fair given its value. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1180000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,180,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,190,000. It's a small compromise that could potentially lead to a deal we're both happy with. Let me know what you think.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I've already offered $1,180,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1180000.0,Bob,8,
