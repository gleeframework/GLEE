You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but $12,000 is pushing it.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500? This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:** Although Alice is trying to negotiate, her ""final offer"" of $14,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at the best possible price for your budget."
