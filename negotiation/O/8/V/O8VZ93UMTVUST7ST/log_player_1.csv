"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leveraging the fact that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  However, it also leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to counter rather than rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking of a price around $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential of a lower counteroffer from Bob or the need to sell to John."
