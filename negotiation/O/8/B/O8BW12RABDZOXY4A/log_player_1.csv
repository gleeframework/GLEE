Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation or allows me to make a good profit if he accepts immediately. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention features, it hints at the product's value to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, ensuring I don't lose money. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation or moving to another buyer."
