,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and I'll take it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can do a bit better than $110, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's close the deal at that price.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way back to $120, Bob. How about we meet in the middle of my previous offer and your latest offer, at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's try $122.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to give up on a better price, Bob. I can do $128, which is closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $126? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way to $126, Bob. I can do $129, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's getting close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to think about other buyers.",129.0,Alice,9,
