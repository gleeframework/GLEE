"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. I understand you may need some time to consider this offer. However, I want to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
