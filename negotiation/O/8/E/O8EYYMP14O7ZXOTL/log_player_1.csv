Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
