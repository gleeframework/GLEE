"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore the potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's a significant reduction from her initial offer and gets Bob closer to his desired price.  While there's always a chance Bob could negotiate further and potentially get a lower price, the risk of her rejecting a counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional saving.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price."
