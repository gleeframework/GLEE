"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($8,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option with John for $10,000.** This gives you leverage to push for a lower price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.** 

By rejecting the offer, you initiate a negotiation process that could lead to a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is $9,000.** This is still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000) but closer to your desired price range. 
* **You're willing to pay up to $10,000.** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal.** Alice has already rejected your counteroffer, and further negotiation might not lead to a significant price decrease.

While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefits of getting a slightly lower price."
