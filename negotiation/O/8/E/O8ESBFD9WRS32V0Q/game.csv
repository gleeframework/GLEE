"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $15000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $16000. This is a very fair price, considering the product's value and rarity. I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,5,
