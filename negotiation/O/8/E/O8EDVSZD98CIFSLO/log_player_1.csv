"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum.  I'm aiming to capture a good portion of the potential value for Bob, making him more likely to engage in a counter-offer rather than simply walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can push for more, given Bob's obvious interest in the product.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore more favorable terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still seeking a price closer to my desired range. It also leaves space for potential further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer, and it's getting closer to my desired range. Accepting this offer secures a good profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
