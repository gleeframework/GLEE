Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down more for this to make sense for me.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering I could go to John right now and get it for that price.

Bob is unwilling to budge above his valuation and is using John as leverage.  It's clear further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his final offer would be a substantial loss.  Selling to John ensures you receive the product's full value."
