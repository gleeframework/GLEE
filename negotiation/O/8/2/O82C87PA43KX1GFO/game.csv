"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000?  ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $975,000.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller.  ",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, so I'll offer the product to you for $1,012,500. This is my final offer.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
