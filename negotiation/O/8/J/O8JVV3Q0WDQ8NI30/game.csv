"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm thinking more in the $8,500 range.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
