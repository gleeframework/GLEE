"Thank you for your understanding, Bob. I've considered your offer and would like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1450000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,,
