"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a fairly aggressive price, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower my price in the following rounds, but I want to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $200 in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but still a decent price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $190,  it's getting late in the game.  $180 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by being too stubborn."
