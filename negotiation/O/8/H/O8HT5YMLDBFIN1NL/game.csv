"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,650,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,650,000 is a step in the right direction, I still feel that the product's value aligns more closely with my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable compromise while respecting the product's value.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
