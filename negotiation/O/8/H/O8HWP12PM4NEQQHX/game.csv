"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000?  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
