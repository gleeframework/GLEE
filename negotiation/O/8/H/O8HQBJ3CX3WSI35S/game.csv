"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering my budget and the value I'm willing to place on the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1800000. This price reflects the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1800000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
