Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being positive and encouraging in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.

I'm still not willing to sell for $8,750. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I believe that John will continue to be a viable option if I don't reach an acceptable price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and come down to $9,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm choosing to sell to John. While I'm close to a deal with Bob, it's not a price I'm happy with. John's offer of $12,000 is much closer to my minimum value and will allow me to earn a better profit."
