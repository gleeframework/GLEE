Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $11,250 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. That's a good price for a great product.  What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and it's not worth the risk of her sticking firmly to a price above $12,000. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
