"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle on this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise and will allow us both to close this deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
