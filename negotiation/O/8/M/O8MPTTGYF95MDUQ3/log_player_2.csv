"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $950,000. He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle on this.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate. While $900,000 is better than $950,000, he can still try to get a lower price. He's willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's still room for a counteroffer. Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
