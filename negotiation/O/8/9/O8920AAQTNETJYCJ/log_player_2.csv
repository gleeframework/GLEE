"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Although it's a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by counter-offering. He has room to negotiate since the product is worth more to him than to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial price is attractive, I'm looking to pay closer to what it's worth to me. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and a great starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I think this is a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves Bob with a profit margin.  There's no guarantee that Bob can negotiate further and get a lower price, so accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous option."
