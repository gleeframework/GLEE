"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a good starting point as it's well above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, especially considering Bob values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

I'm offering $13,800. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for him to come up.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him and lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,500 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing him altogether.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $12,000."
