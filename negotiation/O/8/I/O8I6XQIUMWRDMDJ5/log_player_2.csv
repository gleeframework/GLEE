{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He's aiming for a price that's closer to his maximum price ($15,000) while also leaving some room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer,  and it's still within the acceptable range for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price,  and it's  a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. He has 7 rounds left, so he can still play the game a little longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's beneficial to him. This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to potentially accept while still offering a decent saving for Bob compared to John's price."
