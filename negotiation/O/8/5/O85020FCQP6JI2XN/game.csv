"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
