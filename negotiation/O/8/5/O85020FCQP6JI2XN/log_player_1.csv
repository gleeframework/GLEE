Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $8,000, and $12,000 is a significant step in that direction.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially finding a price that benefits both parties.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the value of the product and are serious about a deal.

**Remember:** You can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, and you can always switch to John as a backup if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, you can still do better. You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's room for a higher price.  You will counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer more,  $9,500 is a significant improvement over selling to John. It's a good compromise and brings you closer to your goal. There's a good chance further negotiation won't lead to a higher price, so accepting is the best course of action."
