"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and it allows me to achieve a substantial return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price further."
