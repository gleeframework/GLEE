Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $14,999. It's a steal at this price and I know you'll be happy with it."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,999 is just below my guaranteed price. This might entice Bob to think he's getting a good deal while still earning me a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a high initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate, potentially still landing within a range above my $15,000 baseline."
