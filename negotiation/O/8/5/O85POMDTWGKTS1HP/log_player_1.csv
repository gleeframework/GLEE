Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). While this might seem risky, it's important to remember you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is open-ended and invites Bob to counter-offer. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you maximize your profit.
* **Bob negotiates:**  You have room to decrease the price, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Bob rejects:**  You move on to John, securing your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the risk that Bob might reject the initial offer."
