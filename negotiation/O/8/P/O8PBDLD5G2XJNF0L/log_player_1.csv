"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, but also establishes a clear expectation that I'm aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away a huge chunk of profit this early.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer the product at $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it also ensures I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'll reject this offer and see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit greater than what John would offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, we're very close to my target price.  It's likely that further negotiations will only result in smaller concessions, potentially taking us through all 10 rounds. Selling to John is always a possibility, but I'm not comfortable with the lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and brings the negotiation to a close."
