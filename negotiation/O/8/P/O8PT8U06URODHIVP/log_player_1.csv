Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 113}
```

I'm going to counter with $113. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give up too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of a lower final price or a lengthy negotiation process isn't worth it. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to guarantee a profit."
