Let's try and get a better price from Alice.  While $110 is a good deal, there's no harm in seeing if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a pretty good price, but I'm on a bit of a budget right now. Would you be willing to go down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're aiming low to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  Even if she doesn't go down to $90, there's room for negotiation to get closer to our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your situation, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, we can't match $90 due to our costs. How about we agree on $95? It's still a great deal, and it would allow us to cover our expenses while providing you with a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met us more than halfway! $95 is a great price and well within our budget. There's no need to push for a lower price and risk losing the deal."
