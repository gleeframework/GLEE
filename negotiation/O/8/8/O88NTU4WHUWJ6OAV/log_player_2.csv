"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great deal for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still above the $80 value Alice has for the product. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
