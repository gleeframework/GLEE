"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer was justified.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would represent a significant discount for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 again, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider it?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but to be frank, $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000, but that's my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I need to explore other options.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $875,000. Can you consider it?",875000.0,Bob,6,
