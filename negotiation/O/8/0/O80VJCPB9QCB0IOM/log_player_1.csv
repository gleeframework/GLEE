"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is better than our safety net (selling to John), but it's still significantly below what we believe the product is worth to him. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer was justified.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would represent a significant discount for you."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 again, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is sticking to his initial counter-offer. It's time to show him we're serious about getting a higher price and are not afraid to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but to be frank, $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000, but that's my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $875,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has moved closer to our desired range. Accepting his offer of $875,000 is a strong deal and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer altogether."
