I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this will encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to potentially find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price.  I'll try to get closer to my original asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. It's a compromise that's closer to my initial offer and hopefully still attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I will sell to John."
