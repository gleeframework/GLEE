"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm currently only able to spend $9,500 at this time. I'm confident this is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Would you be willing to consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. Considering its value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $1,500.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This is a fair price, considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's try to meet in the middle.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,625. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.
