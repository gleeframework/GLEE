Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $82. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $82 saves $18 compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
