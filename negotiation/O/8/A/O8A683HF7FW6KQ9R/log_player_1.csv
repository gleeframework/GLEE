Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and I can still likely settle at a price higher than John's offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 guarantees I won't go empty-handed. This allows me to be bolder with Bob."
