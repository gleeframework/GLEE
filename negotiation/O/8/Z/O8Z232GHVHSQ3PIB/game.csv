"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the value in this product and I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1100000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm still very interested in this product.  However, $1200000 is still stretching my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1200000, which is $1175000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product, $1175000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1160000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and a fair price for both of us.",1160000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1190000, which is the closest I can get to my minimum price of $1200000 without selling it to John for $1200000.",1190000.0,Alice,9,
