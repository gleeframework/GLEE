"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for what I can accept.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so I'll offer $2,050,000. Can you consider this?",2050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To show some flexibility on my end, I can come down to $2,075,000. I'm hoping this can bring us closer to a deal.",2075000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $2,050,000 again, but this time I'll throw in an additional consideration if you can meet me there. Can you consider this?",2050000.0,Bob,6,
