"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth to me while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a considerable profit margin for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
