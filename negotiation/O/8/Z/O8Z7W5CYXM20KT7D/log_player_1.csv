Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth to me while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
