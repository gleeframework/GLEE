"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to the value of the product as possible. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 undervalues the product significantly.  How about we settle at $10,500?  This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
