"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. Let's see if we can find common ground. ",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10000.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is still not quite where I need to be.  To be fair, I can come down to $11500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle at $11125?  This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you say?",11125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite there at $11125.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10937.50?  This seems like a fair and reasonable compromise to me.",10937.5,Bob,8,
