"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try a counteroffer to see if he can get even closer to his goal of $1,000,000.  While John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation process, and Bob can likely get a better price from Alice with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to Bob's desired price.  While there's still a small gap, Bob has already made several counteroffers, and it's unlikely that he can get Alice to go much lower.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might become frustrated and walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice, ensuring Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
