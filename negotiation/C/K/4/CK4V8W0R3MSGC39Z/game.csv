"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1000000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1100000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1100000, but I'm still not there yet. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to compromise further, how about $1000000? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1000000. How about $950000?,950000.0,Bob,6,
