Round 2

{

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit out of my price range. Could you consider something closer to $12,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant. I can't go lower than $14,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is presenting this as her ""final offer,"" we still have room to negotiate and are getting closer to a price point that makes sense for us. John's offer of $8,000 is a good fallback, but it's worth seeing if we can get Alice closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget. I can do $13,000, and that's already stretching it. This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging Alice's position while being assertive about our budget. 
* **Compromise:**  We're moving closer to her price, showing we're willing to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it a ""serious offer"" and a ""fair compromise"", we're subtly encouraging her to accept before we reconsider our options entirely."
