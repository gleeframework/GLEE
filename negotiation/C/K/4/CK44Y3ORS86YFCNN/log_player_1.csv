Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,750 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still not at a point where accepting his offer is better than selling to John.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to see us reach a deal. How about $8,250?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. To be honest, $8,250 is a little too high for me to make work. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7,800. If that's not doable, I completely understand, but I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's latest offer of $7,800 is close enough to my minimum that it's not worth risking the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer allows me to maximize my profit while avoiding the risk of Bob walking away."
