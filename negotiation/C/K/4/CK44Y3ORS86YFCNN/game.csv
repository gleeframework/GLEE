"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,750 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to see us reach a deal. How about $8,250?  That's my final offer.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. To be honest, $8,250 is a little too high for me to make work. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7,800. If that's not doable, I completely understand, but I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity.",7800.0,Bob,6,
