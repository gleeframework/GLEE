"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's much closer to my maximum price than hers. I need to negotiate down to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to move. It's closer to her value, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but not enough. She's still anchored on her initial high price. I'll keep negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,750 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm moving up slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  There's still room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to see us reach a deal. How about $8,250?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is tough. Alice says it's her final offer, but $8,250 is still a significant amount above her value. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get a better deal. It's a risk, but I think it's worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. To be honest, $8,250 is a little too high for me to make work. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7,800. If that's not doable, I completely understand, but I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
``` 

This message does a few things:

* **Acknowledges Alice's ""final offer""**:  This shows respect for her position and avoids seeming dismissive.
* **Expresses budget limitations honestly**: By framing it as a budget issue, I give a reason for my counter without directly devaluing the product. 
* **Shows willingness to compromise**:  Moving up to $7,800 demonstrates  flexibility.
* **Leaves an opening for Alice**: By saying ""If that's not doable..."",  I leave a path for her to counter if she's truly motivated to sell."
