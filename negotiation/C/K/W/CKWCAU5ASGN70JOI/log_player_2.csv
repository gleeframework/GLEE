"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it has the potential to be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
