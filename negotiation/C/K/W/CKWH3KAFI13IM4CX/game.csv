"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I have to decline your counteroffer of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10250. Can we meet in the middle?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10250. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we try $10750?",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. Can we try $10500 again?",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're running out of room to negotiate, but I'm still willing to try to find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to add a small concession: I'll throw in some extras that will add value to the product. How about we try $10500 with the extras included?",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
