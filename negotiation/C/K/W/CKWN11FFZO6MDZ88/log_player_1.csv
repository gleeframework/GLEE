"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I believe I can get a better offer from him or John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the value this product holds for you. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. This offer reflects a serious buyer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below my floor price of $1,000,000. John is a safe bet, and I have time to see if Bob will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $825,000. This price reflects the value you place on the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm trying to keep this purchase under $800,000. How about $780,000? This demonstrates my serious interest, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from him in the next round or if John is still interested in buying the product."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
