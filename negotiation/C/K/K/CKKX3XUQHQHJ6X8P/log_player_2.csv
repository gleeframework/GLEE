"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and negotiate a lower price.  Bob can then counteroffer with a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a better offer than the initial price, it's still not acceptable. Bob should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but  $1,350,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I need.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at a higher price point.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While they are getting closer, it's clear that Alice is firm on her price.  Given the risk of continuing the negotiation, Bob is better off buying from John at $1,000,000 to secure the product and stay within his budget."
