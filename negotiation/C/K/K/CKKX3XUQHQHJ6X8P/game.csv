"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects the true value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but  $1,350,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I need.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at a higher price point. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
