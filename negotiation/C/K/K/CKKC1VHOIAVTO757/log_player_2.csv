"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the price is higher than Alice's valuation, accepting Alice's offer at $14,000 is the best choice for Bob in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Saving money:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Within budget:** The offer is still within Bob's $15,000 limit. 
 
Even though Bob could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she would go lower. Accepting the current offer ensures Bob gets the product without the risk of having to pay more from John."
