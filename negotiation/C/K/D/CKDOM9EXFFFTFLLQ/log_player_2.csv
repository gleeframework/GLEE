"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money.  Buying from John immediately would be a waste of the opportunity to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation but also demonstrating Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 850000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price.  Buying from John at this point would be settling for a higher price than what Bob believes is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but by a smaller amount this time. This shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating and willing to meet halfway. However, he's not willing to concede too much, keeping the pressure on Alice to find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 875000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for 885000, which is the closest I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price and reflects a willingness to meet halfway.  While there's always the chance of getting an even better price, the risk of losing the deal by rejecting and going back and forth is too high.  Also, buying from John at this point would mean paying a significantly higher price."
