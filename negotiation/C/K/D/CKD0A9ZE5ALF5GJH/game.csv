"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective on the value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
