"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for this product. Please let me know if this is possible.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of my product and your financial limitations. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose $10,500 as a potential compromise. This would allow us to come closer to each other's positions without exceeding my budget. Please let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,4,
