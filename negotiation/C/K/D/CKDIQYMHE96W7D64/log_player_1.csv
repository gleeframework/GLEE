I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, but still leaves a profit margin for me. I'm hoping that Bob will be motivated to accept this offer, as it's a better deal for him than the $15,000 he could get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it still gives me a decent profit and is likely more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to get a higher price from Bob, his last offer of $10,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
