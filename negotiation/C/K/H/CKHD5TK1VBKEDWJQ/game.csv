"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to consider a price between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to consider a price between $1,150,000 and $1,200,000, but I can also consider a slightly lower price. How about $1,080,000?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  To make this happen, I can go up to $950,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,050,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
