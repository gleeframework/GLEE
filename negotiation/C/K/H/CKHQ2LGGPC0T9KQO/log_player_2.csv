{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly lower. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
While Alice's offer is getting closer to a price Bob is comfortable with, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's still room for improvement, and the goal is to save as much money as possible."

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's preferred price. Accepting this offer is a good strategy. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether and having to purchase from John at a significantly higher price."
