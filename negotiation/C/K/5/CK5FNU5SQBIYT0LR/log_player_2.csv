Given its high-quality features and unique benefits, we believe it's worth more than its face value of $10,000 to you. Considering its intrinsic value and the effort put into its creation, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer is exclusive to you and reflects our commitment to providing unparalleled value to our esteemed clients. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to enhance your experience with our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is compelling, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay $2,000 more than you have to. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to John and secure the better price."
