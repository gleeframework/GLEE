"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with an offer of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a good profit on this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to make a move.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go up to $1,025,000.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you $1,050,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
