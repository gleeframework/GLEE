Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the potential savings for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if needed.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, so if Bob rejects my offer, I have a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $13,000 is still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $13,500?  This would give you a great deal, and it would be closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not budge too much.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $13,500 is closer to my minimum price point than Bob's offer, but still leaves room for him to get a good deal.
* **Incentivizing Acceptance:**  I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob,  emphasizing that it's a good deal for him.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer allows for potential compromise and leaves the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my needs. I would like to counter your offer at $13,200 for the product. This price aligns more closely with what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $13,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  The negotiation seems to be reaching a stalemate. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and I'm not willing to drop below $15,000. 

**Conclusion:** It's best to take the guaranteed higher price from John and end the negotiation with Bob."
