"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum price point of $100. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's a starting point for negotiation. It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but only at a price that's within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $100 limit. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can reach a more favorable price. He can still buy from John for $100, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate a lower price, but he's also showing that he's willing to compromise. He's increased his offer to $120, which is closer to Alice's price, but still within his budget. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and that he's willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit further and sell the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's price point, but $140 is still above his $100 limit.  He should continue to negotiate. He can still buy from John for a better price, so he's not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $140.  How about we split the difference and I'll pay $130? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he's also trying to find a solution that is fair to both parties. By suggesting a compromise of $130, he is showing that he is willing to meet Alice halfway. He also reminds Alice that this is still a good deal for her, as it is above her minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows that Bob is a reasonable negotiator and that he is truly interested in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $135. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's only a limited number of rounds left.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $100, it's more beneficial to cut his losses and buy from John. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
