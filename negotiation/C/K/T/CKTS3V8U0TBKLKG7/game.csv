"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, but $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
