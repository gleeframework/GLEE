"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the $1,000,000 I counteroffered with, it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
