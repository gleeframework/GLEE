"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you and would allow me to sell the product without taking a loss.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $90.  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
