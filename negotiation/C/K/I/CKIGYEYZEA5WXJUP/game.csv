"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me.  This product offers a lot of value, and I could easily sell it for at least $15,000 elsewhere. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  While I could go to other buyers, I believe this product would be truly beneficial for you. How about we split the difference again and settle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'd be willing to go up to $14,000 if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
