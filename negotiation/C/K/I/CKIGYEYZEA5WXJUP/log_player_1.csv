Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me.  This product offers a lot of value, and I could easily sell it for at least $15,000 elsewhere. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $18,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  While I could go to other buyers, I believe this product would be truly beneficial for you. How about we split the difference again and settle at $15,500?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'd be willing to go up to $14,000 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $14,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk Bob walking away or continuing to lowball."
