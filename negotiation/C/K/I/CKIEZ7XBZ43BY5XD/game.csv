"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $11,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of your item while staying within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and settle at $12,000. This would be a fair price that respects the value of my product while ensuring I don't have to lower my price too much.",12000.0,Alice,5,
