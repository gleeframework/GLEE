{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the value Bob will get. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150, so there's no pressure to accept a low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John is a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to push for a higher price without being overly pressured."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $110? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm counteroffering at $110, which is a compromise between my initial offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit away from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John provides security:** Having John as a backup buyer allows me to take a risk and reject this offer, knowing I can always sell to him for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $95 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference again? $102.50 would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising again:** I'm splitting the difference between my last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($95), showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  $102.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Appealing to logic:** I'm using logic (""split the difference"") to make the offer seem more reasonable and fair.
* **Remaining open:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob still wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going above $95. I'd be happy to buy the product for $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is final:** Bob has made it clear he won't go above $95, and further negotiation is unlikely to change his mind.
* **John's offer is better:**  John is willing to pay $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and might not result in a better price. 

Selling to John is the most profitable and efficient option at this point."
