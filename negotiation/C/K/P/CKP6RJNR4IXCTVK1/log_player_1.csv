{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This gives you a good starting point while still allowing for a potentially mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob, so I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $92.50 is closer but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Would you do $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $88 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and closer to my desired price.  It's also a good indication that Bob is willing to negotiate further."
