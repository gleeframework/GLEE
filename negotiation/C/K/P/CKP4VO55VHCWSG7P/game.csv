"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1200000, which is the minimum I can sell it for?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to meet your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to pay up to $950000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to pay $950000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1150000? It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell below $1200000. I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'd like to make one final offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is as close to my target as I can get. It's a fair price, and I think it's worth considering.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet your target, but I'm still not willing to pay $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1100000, which is $1075000. Can you meet me at that price?",1075000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell below $1200000. I'm running out of room to maneuver, but I'm willing to make one final push. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000, which is just $50000 above your last offer. It's my last concession, and I hope you'll consider it.",1150000.0,Alice,9,
