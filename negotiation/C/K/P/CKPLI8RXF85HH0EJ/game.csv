"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This price reflects my maximum budget while still offering you a fair deal given my evaluation of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to purchase the product within my budget.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
