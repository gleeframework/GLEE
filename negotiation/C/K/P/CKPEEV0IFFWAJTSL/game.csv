"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I believe it's worth less than your initial offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $825000 for the product.  This reflects the value I've placed on it, and it's still a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $775000 is a fair price for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $790000. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $790000. I'm willing to go up to $795000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",795000.0,Bob,6,
