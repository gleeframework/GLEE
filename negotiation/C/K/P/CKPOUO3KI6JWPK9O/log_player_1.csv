"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer acknowledges potential for discussion, signaling flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on the product's worth.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to highlight the product's value and encourage a positive response.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the offer attractive enough to avoid an immediate rejection. We can adjust our approach based on his reaction in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. 

We know we have a backup option with John at $1,000,000, but it's too early to settle. We have room to negotiate and bridge the gap with Bob. By rejecting this offer and presenting a counteroffer, we can try to steer the negotiation towards a more mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal reflects. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price considers the immense value you'll gain from it.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** While we're adjusting our price, we're not drastically dropping to meet Bob's low offer. This emphasizes the product's value and signals we're serious about securing a fair price.
* **Smaller Concession:**  We reduce our price by $50,000, a smaller concession than Bob's, signaling willingness to negotiate but within reasonable limits.
* **Reiterating Value:** We remind Bob of the product's benefits to justify the price and steer his focus away from the initial low offer.

This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to our range while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches both our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  

* **Meeting Our Goal:** Accepting this offer ensures we achieve our goal of selling the product for at least $1,000,000. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation reaching an impasse.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now prevents potential delays and allows us to move forward. 

While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, it's not worth risking a no-deal situation.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
