Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage. However, it's generally good practice to start negotiations slightly below your ideal price to allow room for counter-offers.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're offering the product at a premium ($1,600,000) compared to what John is willing to pay.
* **Confident but Flexible:** You're framing the price as a starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming high. 
* **Highlighting Value:** You're emphasizing the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the price and appeal to Bob's potential interest.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Counter:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial price. You can then decide whether to negotiate down slightly or stick closer to your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, remember that exploring the market further could potentially yield even better offers."
