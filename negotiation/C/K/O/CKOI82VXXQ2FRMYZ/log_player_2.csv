Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $115, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll make a new offer: I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, but still a bit higher than your latest offer.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $125. It's better to buy from John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
