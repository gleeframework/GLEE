"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $11,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $12,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while not ideal, $12,500 is a reasonable price and saves me money compared to John's offer."
