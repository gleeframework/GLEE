"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has valuable features,  $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, however,  $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
