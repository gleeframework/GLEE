"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. 
* **John is a backup:**  You have a backup option in John, so you don't need to accept an unfavorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your budget:** $12,500 is still within your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  The counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her initial price and your target price. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There is still room for Alice to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal within budget:** $13,500 is still within your budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While you could try to counteroffer again, Alice has already shown she's willing to negotiate, and further haggling might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
