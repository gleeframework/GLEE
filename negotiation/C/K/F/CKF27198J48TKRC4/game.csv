,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This represents a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal,  I think we're very close.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,280,000. I hope this is a price that we can both agree on.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
