"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $1,200,000 is a good price for Bob, it's still too low for me. I have more rounds to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a good profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push a bit further.  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,280,000. I hope this is a price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, we're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than my minimum. John's offer guarantees me my desired price, and it's better than risking a counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower."
