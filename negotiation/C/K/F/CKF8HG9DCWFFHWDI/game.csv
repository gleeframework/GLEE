"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $12,000 to you, right?  I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 just isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,750? I'm willing to make a final compromise to get this deal done.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a very fair price considering the value of this product to you.  It's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,800 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,700? I'm willing to make one more compromise to get this deal done.",10700.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm going to come down to $10,750.  This is a good price for you, and it's as low as I'm willing to go.  If you don't accept this offer, I'm going to have to go with another buyer.",10750.0,Alice,9,
