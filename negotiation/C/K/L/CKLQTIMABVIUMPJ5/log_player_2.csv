"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value of $120. This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still potentially making a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit to $135. It's a really good deal for a product you'll get a lot of value from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be reasonable and show he's willing to compromise. He's met Alice halfway from his previous offer, but still keeps it below his maximum value.  This demonstrates a commitment to a deal while still leaving some room for negotiation."
