"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's significantly above my minimum. This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and also potentially force him to reveal his upper limit sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not all the way.  I'm hoping to show flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
