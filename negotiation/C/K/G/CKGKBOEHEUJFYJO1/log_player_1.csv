Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $175 offers a potential profit of $25 over your minimum acceptable price. This markup isn't so high that it's likely to scare Bob away without further negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always lower the price slightly. This demonstrates flexibility and might encourage him to accept a price closer to $150 if he's really interested."
