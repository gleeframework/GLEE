"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is well above your $800,000 minimum, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, increasing the likelihood of him accepting.
* **It sets a positive tone:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit, creating a more collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better price. How about $950000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to your desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  You have 8 rounds left and you can likely get a better deal if you counter.  Selling to John now would only net you $800,000, which is your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). It shows a willingness to compromise and helps keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes that the price is ""fair"" and a ""good value"" for Bob. This reinforces the idea that he's getting a good deal.
* **Staying firm:**  The offer is still significantly higher than your minimum price ($800,000), so you're not giving away too much."
