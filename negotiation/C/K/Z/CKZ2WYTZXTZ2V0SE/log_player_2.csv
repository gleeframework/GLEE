"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I believe you'd find it even more valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting her initial offer, you open the door for negotiation and potentially a lower price closer to her $12,000 valuation."
