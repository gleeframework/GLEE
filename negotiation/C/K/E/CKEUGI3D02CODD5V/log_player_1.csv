Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe  $1,150,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

We're still getting a decent amount above John's offer. It's worth pushing Bob a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum is $1,080,000. If that's agreeable to you, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

Bob has signaled that this is his final offer. Taking anything less than $1,080,000 is risky, and we're already well above John's offer. Time to close the deal!"
