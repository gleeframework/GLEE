You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can potentially get a better deal than $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is a good price. It's only $75,000 more than what John is selling it for.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation."
