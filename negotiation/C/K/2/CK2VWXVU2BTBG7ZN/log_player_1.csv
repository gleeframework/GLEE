{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $150, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It directly states the price and invites Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $100 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you can still try to negotiate for a higher price.  You know the product is worth $150 to him, so there's still room for compromise.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $100. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as that. How about $115? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $105. This brings the price closer to my budget while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $100 and allows you to sell the product without further negotiation. While you could try to push for a higher price, accepting his offer is the most efficient way to close the deal."
