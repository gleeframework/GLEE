"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on your offer. However,  $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $900,000? That would leave us both with a good profit margin and allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $875,000 is my absolute maximum. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
