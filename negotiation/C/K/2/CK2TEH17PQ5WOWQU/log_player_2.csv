"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand that it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
