Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin. 
*  It's a good starting point because: 
    * It's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving him a potential incentive to negotiate.
    * It leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* There's a good chance I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* I'm not willing to sell to John just yet because I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, but it's still above his initial offer of $900,000.
* This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to ensure a reasonable profit margin.
* I believe this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting, while still keeping me close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price.  
*  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, I risk losing the deal and having to accept John's offer for a lower profit margin.  
* This deal secures a good profit and finalizes the sale."
