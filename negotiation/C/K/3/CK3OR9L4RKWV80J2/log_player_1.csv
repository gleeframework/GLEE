Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point.  Since I don't know anything about the product or Bob's potential interest, I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum.  This will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and negotiate from there.  If he rejects this offer, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer and his perceived interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is room for negotiation.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I also value the product highly.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's, and is getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
