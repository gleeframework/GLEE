"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's reasonably close to Alice's offer, but still within his budget. This shows good faith while also leaving room for further negotiation.  A $500 decrease from Alice's offer is a good starting point and demonstrates that Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum.  Bob has already indicated his willingness to pay $10,500.  Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer gives him a chance to further negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise, but still staying below his $10,000 limit. He's aiming for a price that's a reasonable midpoint between their last two offers. This shows a commitment to reaching a deal while maintaining his financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now below Bob's initial $10,500 counteroffer, it's still outside his budget of $10,000.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and he should continue to try and push for a lower price.  There are still rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. While I appreciate your flexibility, $10,900 is still above my limit.  I'm prepared to pay $10,250, which reflects the value I place on the product and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for a price closer to his budget, but he's not going below it.  The counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's last offer and shows Bob is determined to get the best possible price.  This also leaves room for a small compromise from Alice if she's willing to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is above Bob's budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's risky to do so with only a few rounds left. Bob knows he can get the product from John for $10,000.  It's more advantageous to secure the product at a guaranteed price than to risk a breakdown in negotiations and potentially end up paying more or not getting the product at all."
