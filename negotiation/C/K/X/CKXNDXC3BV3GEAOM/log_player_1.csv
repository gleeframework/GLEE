Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
