Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value while proposing a price that suggests a win-win scenario. 

By positioning the offer strategically, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting and you avoid leaving too much money on the table."
