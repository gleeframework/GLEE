"I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
