I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and more than my minimum of $80.  I believe this will be a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to him. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $110. This is still a good price for Bob considering it's worth $150 to him.  I believe this is a fair compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly better than selling to John for $80. Although it's lower than my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm willing to accept it."
