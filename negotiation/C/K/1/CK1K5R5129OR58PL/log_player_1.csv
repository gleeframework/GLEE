Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a rare opportunity and I believe it will be highly valuable for your business. My asking price is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $800,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is fair considering its potential for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer and it's better than risking further rounds of negotiation."
