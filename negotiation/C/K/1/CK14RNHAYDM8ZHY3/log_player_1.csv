Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's time to take the deal and secure a profit."
