"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible deal while staying within his budget. He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the range that makes sense for him. He's also being polite and acknowledging Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you the product for $13,500.  This price still allows me to make a good profit, while also giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  It's closer to Bob's ideal price of $13,000 than Alice's initial offer of $14,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product and save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal, especially since there are only 7 rounds remaining."
