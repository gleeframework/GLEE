"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that? I'm confident this product is a great value, and I'm eager to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $11200. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,200 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's target price of $10,500.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge any more or even walk away from the deal.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
