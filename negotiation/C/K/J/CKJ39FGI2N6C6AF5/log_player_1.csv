Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation of $120. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100."
