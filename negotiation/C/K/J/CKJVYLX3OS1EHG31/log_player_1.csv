"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the product in a way that justifies the high price, even though I haven't revealed specifics yet.
* **Leaving Room:** The high starting point gives me space to come down in subsequent rounds if Bob rejects the offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a high final price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to maximize profit. I believe Bob might be willing to pay more than John, so I'm willing to negotiate for a few rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of accepting a loss. I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer, so I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the value of this product truly is substantial. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Hold Firm:** I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate by decreasing my price, but I'm still holding firm well above his offer and my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** My goal is to get Bob closer to the $1,500,000 mark (or even higher if possible), so I'm aiming for a price point that encourages him to counter again. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** As the rounds progress, I'll need to consider closing the gap more aggressively if necessary. However, I'm confident that with strategic negotiation, I can achieve a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I really need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly increased his offer and is now offering $1,400,000. This is a strong offer and very close to my guaranteed offer from John. 

* **Profitable:** Accepting this offer still gives me a significant profit.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or the negotiation dragging on, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome. 
* **Bird in Hand:**  While I might be able to push Bob slightly higher in further rounds, there's also the risk he walks away. Accepting a strong offer now is preferable to potentially ending up with a worse deal later."
