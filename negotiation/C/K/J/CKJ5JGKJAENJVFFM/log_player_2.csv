Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $8,800, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000.  You maximize your savings by going with John."
