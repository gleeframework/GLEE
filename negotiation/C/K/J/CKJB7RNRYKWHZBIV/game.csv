"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. Would you be willing to consider that price?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $140, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Would you be willing to consider that price?",140.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $142, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could make a decision.",142.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $142, which would be $136. Would you be willing to accept that price?",136.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $136, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $142, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of $142. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",142.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $142. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'll make one last offer: $138. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",138.0,Bob,10,
