Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $100, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially settle at a price closer to $100. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Starting high gives you more negotiating room, but be prepared to come down a bit if Bob rejects your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $85 is better than selling to John, you can likely do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  He's shown interest, and you've already established a price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, his offer of $87.50 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit for me, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
