# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another move. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll offer you a compromise at $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best possible outcome. Alice has revealed that the product is worth $800,000 to her and is unwilling to go any lower. Accepting this offer gets you the product for $200,000 less than your maximum and any further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result."
