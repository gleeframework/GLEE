"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another move. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll offer you a compromise at $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,5,
