"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potentials, but I'm not quite ready to meet that price.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, I'm still finding it difficult to justify going above $900,000.  Would you be open to that figure?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
