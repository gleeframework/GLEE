Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can still likely settle above John's offer. 
* **Justify the Price:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.

By offering the product at $1,350,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob, while still leaving a margin for negotiation. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has the security of John's $1,000,000 offer as a fallback."
