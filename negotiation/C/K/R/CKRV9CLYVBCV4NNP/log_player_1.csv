Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, as you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and could be attractive to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John's offer gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. I have a strong backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This offer still gets me closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000 while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** We've reached a point where our offers are very close, and further negotiation might take a lot of time and effort.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the full $1,500,000, which is a much safer and more profitable option.

**Conclusion:**  Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  selling to John is the most sensible decision given the current situation."
