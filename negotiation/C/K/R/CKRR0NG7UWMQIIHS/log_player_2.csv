(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. At this point, Alice's offer is getting too close to John's offer. You might be able to get a better deal from Alice in the next round, but you're not guaranteed to, and it's better to avoid the risk. You've already had a lot of rounds with Alice, so the chances of her coming down to a price you're happy with are slim. It's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
