"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, my original price is based on the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $750,000 is too low.  Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really think this is the maximum I can go.",825000.0,Bob,4,
