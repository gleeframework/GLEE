"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I think it will be very valuable for you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice with a lower price in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? It's a fantastic deal for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is a lower price than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. He can get the product for less from John, so he should try to negotiate with Alice further or go with John."
