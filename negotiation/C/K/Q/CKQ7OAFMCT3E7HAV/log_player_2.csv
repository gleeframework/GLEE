# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  You're better off rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice will come down closer to her value of $12,000. You can always buy from John for $15,000 as a last resort."
