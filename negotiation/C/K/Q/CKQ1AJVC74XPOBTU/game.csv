"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe would be a significant asset to your operations. I understand its worth to you is considerable, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while still providing you with a substantial return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
