"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think it's a great deal, especially since it's worth significantly more to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Even though you value the product at $120, Alice is selling it for $100. This is a better deal than paying John $120.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is lower than that."
