Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I think it's a great deal, especially since it's worth significantly more to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Avoid Extreme Anchoring:**  Going straight to $120 might scare Bob away.  $100 is a strong but not unreasonable starting point.
* **John as a Backup:** We know we have a guaranteed $80 from John, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
