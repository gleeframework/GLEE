"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the 'game-changer' potential, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
