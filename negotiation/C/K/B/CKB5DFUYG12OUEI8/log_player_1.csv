Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a bit more. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate before I have to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us. It's still above my minimum, and it leaves you with a good profit.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have 4 more rounds to try and get a better deal.  I'm hoping that with a few more counteroffers, I can convince Bob to come up to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $9,250 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference again and go with $9,625.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9625}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though it's getting close to my minimum, I have two more rounds to negotiate and I still believe I can get a better price. It's a risky strategy, but I'm going to keep pushing for a higher offer."

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and this is my last round. I'm not comfortable taking the risk of rejecting his offer and potentially walking away with nothing.  John's offer is less than what I hoped for, but it guarantees me at least $8,000, which is my minimum."
