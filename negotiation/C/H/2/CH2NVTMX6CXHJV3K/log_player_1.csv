Round 8
Bob's offer:

}

**Reasoning:**

While still below my ideal price, Bob is clearly anchored at $10,500 and is unlikely to budge much higher. The ""even larger bonus"" sweetens the deal, making the overall offer more appealing. It's better to accept a slightly lower price with a bonus than risk losing the sale entirely in the remaining rounds."
