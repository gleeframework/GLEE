"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the better strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a reasonable offer, close to Alice's valuation but still lower than her initial asking price. This gives Bob a good starting point and allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident in the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's in the middle of Bob's previous offer of $13,000 and Alice's initial offer of $14,000. This is a good deal for Bob as he saves $500 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures a deal and saves valuable time in further negotiation."
