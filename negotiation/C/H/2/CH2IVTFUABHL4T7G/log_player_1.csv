Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I feel that's a fair offer considering its value to me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my absolute limit. I'd be willing to stretch to $13,000. Let me know if that works for you - otherwise, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $13,000 offer.  While we could counter, it's risky. He might walk, and any successful negotiation would likely result in a price much closer to $13,000 than our $15,000 minimum. 

John offers a guaranteed $15,000. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
