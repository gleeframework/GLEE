Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000, showing you're not desperate to sell.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:**  This sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your target:** While it's above your minimum, it's still lower than what you'd like to get. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still a gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. This indicates that further negotiation could lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  While John is a backup, you want to see if you can get closer to your target price with Bob. 

Let's see if you can push for a better deal!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  You're showing you're not willing to settle for his initial counteroffer.
* **It's still below your original offer:** This signals that you're flexible and open to finding a middle ground. 
* **It leaves room for a potential deal:**  A further slight adjustment from either side could lead to a successful outcome.

This approach demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also protecting your interests. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting lower:**  He's now gone down to $12,000, which is getting closer to your minimum but still not ideal.
* **A small gap remains:**  You're only $500 apart. This suggests a potential for a final compromise.
* **Selling to John is a potential fallback:** You're not desperate to close the deal, so you can use John as a leverage point.

Let's see if you can close the deal with one last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:**  It's right in the middle of your desired price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaves room for a small concession:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to meet you halfway here.
* **Is still above your minimum:**  You're not accepting a price that's significantly lower than what you need.

This approach aims to close the deal while still ensuring you get a fair price. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  He's now dropped to $11,500, which is very close to your minimum and below what you'd like to get.
* **Negotiations are stalling:**  Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. Continuing to negotiate might just lead to further delays and lower offers.
* **John offers a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John ensures you get your minimum and avoids the risk of further haggling with Bob that might result in an even lower price. 

While it's unfortunate to not get closer to your target price, selling to John guarantees a sale and allows you to move on."
