"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this valuable product.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the product's true value, and it allows us to find a solution that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it still doesn't quite reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $1,550,000. This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
