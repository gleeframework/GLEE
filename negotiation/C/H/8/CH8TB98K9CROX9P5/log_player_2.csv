# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $18,000. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's deal."
