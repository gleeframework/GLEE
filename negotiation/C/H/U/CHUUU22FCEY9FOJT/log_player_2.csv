"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that I believe is fair to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1100000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than your maximum.  You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better financial choice."
