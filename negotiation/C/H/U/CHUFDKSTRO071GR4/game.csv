"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair valuation given the product's potential, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
