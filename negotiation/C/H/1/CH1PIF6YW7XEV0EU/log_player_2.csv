I'm confident this product will significantly benefit your operations.  Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting her offer is the most financially sound decision."
