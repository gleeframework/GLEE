While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,750,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price is still a $250,000 profit over what John is offering and a good amount over Bob's initial offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely. Bob might walk away, or the time spent might be better used securing other deals.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting shows flexibility and builds goodwill with Bob, potentially leading to future business."
