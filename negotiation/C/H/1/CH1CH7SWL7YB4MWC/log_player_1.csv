Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving some room for negotiation. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more than my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll try to get closer to my initial target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to  $135, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his proposed price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating, but at this point, it's likely that we're nearing the maximum price Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to secure a sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to no deal at all."
