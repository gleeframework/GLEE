While we're not quite at our ideal price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,260,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** This offer still provides a significant profit margin over our minimum and is considerably higher than John's offer.
* **Negotiation Trends:**  Bob is clearly interested and is incrementally increasing his offer. Holding out for more might backfire. 
* **Time Value:** We have limited rounds, and securing a good deal now outweighs the risk of walking away with nothing and settling for John's lower offer later."
