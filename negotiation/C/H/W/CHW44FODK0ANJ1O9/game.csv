"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $12000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8000. I'm thinking of a price between $10000 and $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8000. It's the absolute maximum I can pay right now. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
