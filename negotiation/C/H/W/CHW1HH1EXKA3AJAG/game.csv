"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,
