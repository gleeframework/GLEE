Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and the price is now within a reasonable range for Bob. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting the offer and making the price even higher. Additionally, there's a chance that Alice might decide to stop negotiating and sell the product to John. Accepting the offer at $9,750 is the best option to secure the product within Bob's budget and avoid potential risks."
