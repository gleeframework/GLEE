Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price and negotiate down if needed. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it implies that there's additional value Bob might not be aware of. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price."
