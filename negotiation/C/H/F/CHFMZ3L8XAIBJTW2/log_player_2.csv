"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* However, you know Alice values the product at $800,000. There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price by rejecting this initial offer. 
* Alice mentioning ""other interested parties"" might be a tactic to pressure you, but you have a backup option with John."
