"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum. This should incentivize Bob to negotiate without immediately rejecting the offer. I also added a friendly message to foster a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not desperate for a sale and believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $112 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $118.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 118.50} 
```"
