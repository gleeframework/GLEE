"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $112?",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $112 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $118.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal.",118.5,Alice,5,
