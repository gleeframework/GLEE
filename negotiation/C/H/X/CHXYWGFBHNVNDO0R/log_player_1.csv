Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than $12,000 but high enough that Bob sees it as a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is close to Alice's minimum, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. 

By offering the product just below her guaranteed sale price, Alice maximizes her chances of a profitable sale to Bob while still securing a good outcome if Bob declines."
