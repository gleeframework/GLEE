I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $7,500, I'm still holding out for a better price closer to my desired value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob's offer of $7,750 is closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  John is guaranteed to buy for $8,000, which is a safe and reliable choice."
