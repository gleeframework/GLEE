"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a decent price for both of us.",77.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a good price, but $77 still isn't quite right for me. I'm willing to go down to $82. It's a good deal for both of us, as we're getting closer to a compromise. Let me know what you think.",82.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That seems like a fair compromise.",80.0,Bob,6,
