Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My starting price is $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as $70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a decent price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $77 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a good price, but $77 still isn't quite right for me. I'm willing to go down to $82. It's a good deal for both of us, as we're getting closer to a compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from him.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
