"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider $750000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than 750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value of the product, $825000 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to accept $800000?  This would be a significant saving for me and still allow you a reasonable profit.",800000.0,Bob,4,
