Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I need to get as close to my minimum as possible. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're very close to your ideal price, and you only have five rounds left. If you reject this offer, you risk Alice raising the price again, or even deciding to stop negotiating. Additionally, you have the option of buying from John, but his price is higher than Alice's current offer.  It's best to accept the offer and close the deal."
