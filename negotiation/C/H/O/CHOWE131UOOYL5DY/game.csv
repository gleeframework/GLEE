"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in exploring a potential deal, but I'm only willing to go as high as $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
