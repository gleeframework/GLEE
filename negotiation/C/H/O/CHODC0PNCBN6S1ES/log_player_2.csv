Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,250.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than his ideal price. He has more room to negotiate and can likely get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, it's still higher than his ideal price.  He should keep negotiating to see if he can get it closer to his goal. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and he can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $9,750.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200, which is the closest I can get to your desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While he could continue negotiating with Alice, he's already reached a point where the price difference is small and the risk of continuing is high. There are only three rounds left, and Alice may not be willing to budge further. It's smarter to take the guaranteed deal with John and save himself the potential stress and time of continued negotiations."
