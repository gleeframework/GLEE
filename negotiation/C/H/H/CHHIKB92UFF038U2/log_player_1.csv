"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his valuation of the product, it's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. There's little incentive to continue negotiating, as he's unlikely to go higher. Selling to John guarantees a fair price without the risk of further haggling."
