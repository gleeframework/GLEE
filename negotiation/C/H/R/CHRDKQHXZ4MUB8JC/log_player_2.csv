It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a better deal."

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice has come down significantly and is now offering a price that is within my budget. It's a good deal for me, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
