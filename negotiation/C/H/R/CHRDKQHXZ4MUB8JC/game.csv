"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
