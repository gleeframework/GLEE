"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $825,000. This reflects the product's worth while respecting your financial needs. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and propose $800,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, as it reflects the product's value to me. If you're truly interested in acquiring this exceptional product, I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
