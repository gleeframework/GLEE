"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you made an offer. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to come down a little more?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. I think we're getting close, and I'm willing to make a concession to meet you in the middle. Let's meet at $825,000 and see if we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
