Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose $8,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $9,000 at this point, and I believe I can still convince Bob to come up to that price or at least get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for meeting me halfway at $8,750. I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'd like to propose $8,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob isn't going to budge much further.  I'm already losing money by accepting his offer, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John is the best option right now."
