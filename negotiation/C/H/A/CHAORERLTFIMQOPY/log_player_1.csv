I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm lowering my price to $10,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This is a good middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer, and will try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is my final offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as I'm already significantly below my initial price. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is very close to my desired price, but I don't have time to continue negotiating.  John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so I'll accept his offer."
