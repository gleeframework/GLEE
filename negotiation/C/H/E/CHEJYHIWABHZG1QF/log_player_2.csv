Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,200. I'm already losing money at this point. If you're not willing to meet me at $9,200, I think it's best for me to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not worth my while to continue negotiating at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

It seems like Alice is getting close to her limit. While you might be able to get the price a little lower in another round, there's a risk she'll walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting $9,200 guarantees you get the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer."
