"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth significantly more. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than Alice's minimum value ($1,200,000) but still within your maximum budget ($1,500,000). 
* However, you want to save as much money as possible.  
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $1,350,000? That still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $1,350,000, which is still below your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* This offer is closer to your ideal price of $1,300,000. 
* It's likely that further negotiation will result in a price that's closer to Alice's minimum value, which could potentially lead to a longer negotiation process. 
* Accepting the offer saves time and avoids the risk of Alice eventually walking away from the deal."
