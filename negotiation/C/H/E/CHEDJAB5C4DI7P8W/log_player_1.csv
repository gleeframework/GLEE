"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in it, and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1225000}"
