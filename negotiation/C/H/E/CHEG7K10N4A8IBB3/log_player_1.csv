Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum value of $12,000, I want to see if I can do slightly better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer.  I'm confident that I can get a price closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm saving money and you're getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my original asking price of $14,000 and is above my minimum of $12,000. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
