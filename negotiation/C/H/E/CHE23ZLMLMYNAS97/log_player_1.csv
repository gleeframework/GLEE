Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $200, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he immediately rejects it, we know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, it gives us a starting point for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, we have John as a backup buyer at $150. This means we're not pressured to accept any offer below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $120 is above his perceived value of $80, indicating he's willing to negotiate.
* **Below Our Minimum:** Accepting $120 would be a loss for us since our minimum is $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer gives us a chance to counter and work towards a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. I value this product at a higher price point due to its features and quality. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach often feels fairer to both parties in a negotiation. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Our Minimum:**  $170 is still a profitable price for us, allowing us to make a decent profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps us understand how much further Bob might be willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is above our absolute minimum of $150.
* **Close Enough:** While we could try to negotiate further, $140 is reasonably close to our target, and it's unlikely Bob will go much higher. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting this offer secures a profit and allows us to move on."
