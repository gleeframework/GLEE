**Reasoning:** 

Bob seems firmly anchored at $100.  While we might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of him, it's unlikely to be a significant increase.  The risk of him walking away and the time cost of further negotiation make accepting John's offer of $100 the most logical choice at this point."
