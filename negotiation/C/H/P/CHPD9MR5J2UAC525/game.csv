"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product and is within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $890,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
