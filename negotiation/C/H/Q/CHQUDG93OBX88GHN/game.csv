"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair price reflecting its true worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I see you're serious about this purchase. How about we settle at $1,450,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
