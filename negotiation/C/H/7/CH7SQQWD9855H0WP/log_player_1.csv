{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It's also friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, but it's still above my minimum. I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about $10,250? This still leaves a good profit margin for you, and it's closer to the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $10,250 is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the fact that I'm willing to pay a premium. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is close to my minimum and leaves a decent profit margin.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's time to finalize the deal and move on."
