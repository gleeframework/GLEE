"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I believe the product's value will be worth it to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $9,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
