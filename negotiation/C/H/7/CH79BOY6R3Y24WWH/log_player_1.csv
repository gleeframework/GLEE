Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value ($10,000), the message focuses on the potential benefits to encourage him to consider a price higher than his initial valuation. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you will sell to John without further interaction."
