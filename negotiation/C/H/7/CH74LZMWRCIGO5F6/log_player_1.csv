"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm not immediately selling at my minimum value. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a higher price in the next round.  I'm not ready to settle for that low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. This gives Bob a better deal than my initial price, but still ensures I make a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to maximize my profit and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's a further compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.  This price is still above my minimum, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the more appealing option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not entirely satisfied with the price.  I'm going to counter one more time to see if I can push for a better deal.  However, if this counteroffer fails, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $105, which is just above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will finally accept. If he rejects this, I'm selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum value. While I could keep negotiating, I'm running out of time.  It's a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John. I don't want to risk losing any more time and potentially ending up with nothing."
