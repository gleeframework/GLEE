Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes it seem like Bob is getting a deal. This increases the chances of him accepting the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, which could still land you a price above your minimum."
