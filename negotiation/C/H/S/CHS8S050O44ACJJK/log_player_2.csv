{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11125?  I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to be flexible.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10937.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $11031.25. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,031.25.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,031.25

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $11,031.25 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still a small gap, and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to keep trying with Alice before resorting to John."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $11007.81? That's a small step from my previous offer, and I'm sure we can agree on a price that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $11,007.81 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still a small gap, and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Bob has already made a counteroffer that is very close to this price, and Alice's counteroffer is very small.  It is likely that Bob can get Alice to come down a bit further, and is better to continue to negotiate."
