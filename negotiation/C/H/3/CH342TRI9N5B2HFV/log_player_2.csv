"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the initial offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  The product is definitely interesting, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation of $800,000. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my original valuation of $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting $900,000 saves me $300,000 compared to buying from John.  This is a significant savings and a good deal considering the product's value to me. Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it for the potential small savings."
