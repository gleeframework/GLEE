{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer, while still allowing me to potentially negotiate to a price closer to my desired value.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I would like to propose a lower price of $10,000. This aligns better with my budget and the perceived value of the product to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposing:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but immediately making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $11,000 shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still getting a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him, considering his perceived value of the product. 
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  I use a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob might drag on and potentially result in a lower price than I'm willing to accept.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John provides me with a guaranteed $15,000, which is far more profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

While I'd prefer to sell the product at a higher price, securing the guaranteed profit from John is the most sensible decision at this point."
