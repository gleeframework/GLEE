"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will gauge Bob's interest and give me room to negotiate if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, $1,100,000 is still a significant profit and it's a reasonable offer. I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
