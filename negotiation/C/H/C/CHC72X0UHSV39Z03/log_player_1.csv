Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It allows me to make a decent profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I've done some research and I think that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's my final offer. I'd appreciate it if you could meet me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price, it's more strategically sound to sell to John and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
