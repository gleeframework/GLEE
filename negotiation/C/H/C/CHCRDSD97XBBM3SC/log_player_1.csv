"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $50 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $50 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum.  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $50 is way too low. I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I can't go that low. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference closer to my budget, say $65?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $65 is still much lower than my minimum. I'm not going to give up on this negotiation yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about $85?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
