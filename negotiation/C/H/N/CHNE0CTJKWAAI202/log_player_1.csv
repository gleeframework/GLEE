Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than $80 from John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. How about $95? That's only $5 more than your offer, and it would be a good compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle again? I'd be willing to pay $92.50. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $92.50 is a good compromise and significantly higher than what I'd get from John. It's time to close the deal."
