"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, you want to save as much as possible. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's a significant gap between her asking price and your maximum.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  By rejecting, you initiate a negotiation process that could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see how much she's willing to come down.
* **Building momentum:** By making a counteroffer, you're actively engaging in the negotiation process and showing Alice your seriousness in purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While her offer is better than her initial $1,400,000, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Room for further negotiation.** You've already demonstrated your willingness to pay less than her original asking price, so there's still potential for further compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage.** By rejecting, you maintain pressure on Alice to come down to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Instead of a large jump, this offer is a smaller increase from your previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate but also a firm stance on your desired price.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** This offer aims to find the middle ground between Alice's current offer and your previous one. It suggests you're willing to meet halfway, encouraging Alice to reciprocate.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** This offer is still significantly lower than John's price, making it a more attractive deal for Alice compared to walking away and selling to John."
