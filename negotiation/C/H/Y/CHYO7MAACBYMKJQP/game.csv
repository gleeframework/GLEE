"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $9500? This is my top price, but I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $11000 is closer, I'm still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be able to make a good profit.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11200. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11200.0,Alice,5,
