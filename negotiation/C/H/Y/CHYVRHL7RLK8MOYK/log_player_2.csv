"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible.  He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and he wants to stay within his budget of $1,500,000. Offering $1,300,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for Alice to counter while still allowing Bob to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good price for Bob.  He's already rejected a lower offer and knows he could go to John for $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer at this point makes sense."
