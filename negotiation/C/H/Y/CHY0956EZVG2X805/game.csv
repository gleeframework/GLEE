"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,625? This is a fair price considering our respective positions.",11625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I appreciate that.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $11,900. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",11900.0,Alice,5,
