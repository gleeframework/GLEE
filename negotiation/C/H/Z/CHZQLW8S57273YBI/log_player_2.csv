You should still reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay $8,000 and there is still a gap between $10,500 and your target. It's worth attempting another counteroffer."

This counteroffer is a compromise, slightly higher than your previous offer but still below Alice's latest offer. It shows you are serious about buying the product but are still trying to get a good deal."

Alice has consistently rejected your counteroffers, and her final offer is still above your target of $8,000.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $8,000 to guarantee you get the product within your budget."
