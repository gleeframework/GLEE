"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum budget, so there's no benefit to accepting it. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it establishes a lower price point that Bob can build upon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement on her initial offer. This is a good compromise, and Bob is likely to save $500 by accepting compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will lead to further price decreases, but it's not worth the risk of losing the product to John or wasting time in further negotiation."
