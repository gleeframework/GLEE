"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000 yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer on this end, so I hope we can meet in the middle",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm afraid I've already decided to move on to another opportunity if we can't come to an agreement. I was willing to meet you at $950000, but I think I'll have to pass. Good luck finding another buyer!",950000.0,Bob,6,
