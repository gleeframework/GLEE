I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's attractive to Bob as it's well below the value he places on the product.  We'll see if he accepts or counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $500 less than my initial offer, and still above my minimum price.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the sale."
