Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we seem to be a bit far apart. Let's try to close this gap.  How about $15,000?  That's a firm offer, reflecting the true value of this product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $15,000. It's better to cut off negotiations and take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000."
