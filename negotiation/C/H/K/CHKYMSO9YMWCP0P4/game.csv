"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Perhaps we can meet somewhere in the middle - how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we seem to be a bit far apart. Let's try to close this gap.  How about $15,000?  That's a firm offer, reflecting the true value of this product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
