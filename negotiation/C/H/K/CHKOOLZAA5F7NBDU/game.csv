"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this price takes into account the value I'll get from the product, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $750,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. This product is going to bring you a substantial return, and I need to see that reflected in the final price.  My final offer is $800,000.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really struggling to justify the value of the product at $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Can we try $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
