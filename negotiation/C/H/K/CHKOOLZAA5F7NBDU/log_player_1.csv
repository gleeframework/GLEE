"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this price takes into account the value I'll get from the product, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000?"",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer, Bob's offer is still below my fallback option of selling to John. I'll try to negotiate one more time before conceding."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $750,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. This product is going to bring you a substantial return, and I need to see that reflected in the final price.  My final offer is $800,000.  Take it or leave it."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really struggling to justify the value of the product at $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Can we try $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I'd prefer $800,000, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his offer of $775,000 is better than risking a worse deal or settling for John's offer."
