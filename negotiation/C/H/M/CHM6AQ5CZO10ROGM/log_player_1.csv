Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're not eager to go as low as $80, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $95. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92.50 is close enough to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting his offer is the best course of action at this point."
