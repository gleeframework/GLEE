"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $160?  That's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $155?  That's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",155.0,Bob,4,
