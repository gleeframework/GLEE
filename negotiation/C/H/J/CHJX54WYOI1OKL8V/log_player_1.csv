Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially earn a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also conveys that you value the product highly.
* **Psychology:** A direct and confident approach can be effective in negotiations. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but always keep your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) in mind."
