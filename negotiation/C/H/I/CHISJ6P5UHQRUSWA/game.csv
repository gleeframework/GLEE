"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still giving you a decent profit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
