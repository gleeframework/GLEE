Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $13,250. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finally find a price that works for both of us.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is where it gets tricky. Let's analyze:

* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** She's made it clear that she's making concessions and needs to make a profit.
* **You have room to negotiate but risk losing the deal:** You could try for a slightly lower price, but Alice might walk away. 
* **John is a guaranteed win, but you miss a potential deal:** You'll save the most money, but you might have gotten the product for even less with Alice.

**Decision:**

It's a judgment call, but since you're aiming for the absolute lowest price, the safest option is to go with John.

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While there's a chance Alice might go lower, it's getting riskier. Buying from John guarantees you the best possible price you've determined is acceptable."
