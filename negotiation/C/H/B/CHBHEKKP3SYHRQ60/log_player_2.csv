Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price of $10,000, and you have 3 rounds left.** It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your price point.  
* **The ""premium service package"" is a tactic to make the offer seem more appealing.** However, it's not clear if you actually need or want the service. It's best to focus on the product price itself. 
* **John's offer is always there, but you're still closer to getting a good deal from Alice.** It's worth seeing if you can get her down further."

Round 8
