"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to highlight the value of the product and create a sense of urgency. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to show I'm open to negotiation and potentially find a mutually beneficial price. 

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. If I don't get a satisfactory offer, I can always choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** While $900,000 is closer, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.
* **I'm not desperate.** I have the option of selling to John for my target price, giving me leverage in the negotiation. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and gauge how willing he is to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to push the price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind the limited rounds and my fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This signals a willingness to compromise while maintaining my leverage.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, reinforcing the potential benefits of the deal for him.
* **Urgency:**  I'm stating that this is a ""significant concession"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I'll need to decide if I want to make another concession or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my counteroffer, I'm not yet desperate enough to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired target.
* **I'm confident in my fallback option.** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage to continue negotiating. 
* **There's still potential for a better deal.** I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer, especially considering he's already shown some willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'll need to consider the limited rounds remaining and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's current offer of $920,000. This shows a commitment to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price and emphasize the benefits for both parties.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""Let's close this deal!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide if I'm willing to make another concession or if it's time to sell to John. The remaining rounds and my minimum acceptable price will guide my next decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $915,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds remaining, the negotiation is reaching a critical point. 
* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $915,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I'm not confident I can get him to move much higher.
* **John is a Safe Bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure my desired price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to reach a mutually acceptable price."
