{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, it's always best to try and get the highest possible price.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. We need to offer a price that's attractive to him but also profitable for us.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering a price of $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him.
    * We make a $150,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:** Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing delays that could lead us to miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
