"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $9,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to negotiate. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He should try to get a lower price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to accept $8,750? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it seems like Alice is not willing to go much lower than $8,900.  Bob has already made a counteroffer that was closer to his target price, and Alice still rejected it.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially going through more rounds, Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees him the product at his target price, and saves him time and effort."
