"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for some room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of getting a good price. I'm curious to see Bob's reaction to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price, especially considering I started at $200. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $165 is close to my minimum and within a reasonable range for negotiation.  Given that I have already rejected his previous offer and we are already in round 4, it seems like the negotiation is reaching a good stopping point. Accepting this offer will ensure a sale and a decent profit."
