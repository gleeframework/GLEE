Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to take another risk and try to negotiate further. It seems that Alice is willing to meet me halfway, so I'm hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and Alice's offer is still too high for my comfort level.  While I'm tempted to try another round of negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer again and losing the chance to buy from John is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price."
