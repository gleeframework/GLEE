"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $15,200. I hope we can find a compromise.",15200.0,Bob,4,
