Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiations. 
* **Not Too High:**  I'm not starting at the maximum ($150) because I want to leave room for negotiation and avoid immediate rejection.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but I'm only able to go up to $120 for this product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for $150, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value this product at more than $120, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $130? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial price.
* **Fairness:** I'm presenting the new price as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter again if he's not satisfied with the price."
