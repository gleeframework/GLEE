"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, given its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. It signals your seriousness in buying the product while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was hoping we could meet at a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price that's more favorable to you.  There are still rounds remaining, and you may be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,500.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to meet Alice halfway while remaining within your budget.  It demonstrates your desire to close the deal but also your firmness in your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to ensure I get a good deal on this product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is still above your budget of $10,000.  While there are still rounds left, the negotiations seem to be stalling.  Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees you the product at a price you're comfortable with, rather than risking further negotiation with Alice that could end with you exceeding your budget."
