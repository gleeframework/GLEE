{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500, which is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** A high initial offer conveys confidence and seriousness. 

However, be prepared to negotiate further!  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a bit lower than our ideal price, it's still above his perceived value.  This means we have some room to negotiate upwards, potentially getting a better deal.  We're also confident that John is a reliable buyer, so we don't have to rush into a sale just to avoid losing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That seems like a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a good deal considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above Bob's value:**  $9,000 is closer to our target price than Bob's offer.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""good deal"" makes the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to our ideal price, but it's still below our minimum acceptable price.  We're willing to negotiate further and potentially get closer to $9,000.  We're also confident that John is a reliable buyer, so we're not pressured to sell immediately."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, but that's my final offer. This price still gives you a great value, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your needs."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Small concession:**  We're showing flexibility while still staying close to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterate value:** We're reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him."
