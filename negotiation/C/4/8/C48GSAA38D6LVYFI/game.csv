"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That seems like a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a good deal considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, but that's my final offer. This price still gives you a great value, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your needs.",8900.0,Alice,5,
