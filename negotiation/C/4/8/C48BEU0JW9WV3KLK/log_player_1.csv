Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) allows us to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It shows we're serious but open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, you could adjust the offer accordingly."
