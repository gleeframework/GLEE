"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe you'd find it highly beneficial. While I'm confident you'll appreciate the value, I have another offer on the table for $800,000, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and John offers the product for less. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
