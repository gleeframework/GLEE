"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1080000 is a bit too low for me, but $1065000 is a bit too low as well. How about we meet at $1075000? It's a small concession from my end, but I'm willing to make it to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
