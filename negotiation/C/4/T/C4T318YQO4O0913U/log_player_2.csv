"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, a price that I believe reflects its worth to you while also being fair to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, you can get the product for a much better price from John ($1,000,000).  You should prioritize saving money in this scenario."
