"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential"" of the product without revealing its exact worth to you. This helps justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $1,600,000, there's a significant gap between the asking price and both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's valuation ($1,000,000). This creates space for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below his own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to achieve a higher selling price. You're willing to risk continuing the negotiation to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,200,000 is below what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's true worth and my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a significant concession from your initial offer ($150,000 reduction) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to engage more seriously.
* **Holding Ground:** The counteroffer of $1,450,000 is still significantly above both your minimum and Bob's offer, providing room for further negotiation while aiming for a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's worth while emphasizing a desire for a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" This framing encourages Bob to see the negotiation as collaborative rather than adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Potential Upside:** While $1,300,000 is still below your desired outcome, you have six more rounds to potentially bridge the gap and secure a higher price. 
* **Calculated Risk:** You're willing to take a calculated risk by rejecting this offer.  There's a chance Bob might walk away, but the potential for a better deal outweighs accepting his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I'm aiming for a deal that works well for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting $1,375,000, you're splitting the difference between your last offer ($1,450,000) and his latest ($1,300,000). This signals fairness and a desire to compromise.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still targeting a price above your absolute minimum.
* **Closing Language:** The phrase ""shows my commitment to reaching an agreement"" subtly introduces the idea of finalizing the deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could continue negotiating, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll drastically change his position in the remaining rounds.
* **Acceptable Profit:** $1,250,000 is above your absolute minimum and represents a reasonable profit.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has opportunity costs. Accepting now secures the deal and allows you to move on to other potential opportunities. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing for more risks Bob walking away entirely, leaving you with John's offer of $1,200,000.  Accepting $1,250,000 is a safer bet at this stage."
