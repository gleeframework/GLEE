Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers tremendous value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, she wants to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, should he counter-offer. 
* **High but Potentially Acceptable:**  While $9,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000), it might be acceptable if the product offers unique benefits or solves a problem for Bob that justifies the extra cost."
