"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product Description].  This product is valued at over $1000000 to me, and I believe it has immense potential for you. I'm initially offering it for $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1400000 is still below my minimum threshold. To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, and I respect the value you see in this product. I am willing to increase my offer to $1425000. This is my final offer before I consider purchasing the product from another seller.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1425000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, and offer you the product for $1437500.  Let's make this deal happen.",1437500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed our previous discussions, and I'm willing to match your last offer of $1437500. This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe it's within my budget. I look forward to proceeding with the purchase.",1437500.0,Bob,6,
