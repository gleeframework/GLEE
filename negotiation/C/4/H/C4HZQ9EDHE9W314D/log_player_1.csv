Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is still significantly less than the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get closer to my goal."
