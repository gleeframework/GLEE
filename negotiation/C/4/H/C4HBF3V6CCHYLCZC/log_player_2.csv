"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to her, but she's offering it to me for $1,200,000, which is still $300,000 more than what I'm willing to pay. I'd rather buy it from John for $1,000,000.
