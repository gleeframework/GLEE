"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  It's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775,000? I think it's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $775,000 is still too far off. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. That's a great price for you, and it's still within my acceptable range.",800000.0,Alice,5,
