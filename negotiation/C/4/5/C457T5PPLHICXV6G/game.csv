"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can offer you a price of $13,500, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
