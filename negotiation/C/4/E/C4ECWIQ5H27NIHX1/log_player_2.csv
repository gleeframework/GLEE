"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value proposition, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($8,000) gives us more room to negotiate upward while staying well below our $10,000 limit. 
* **Polite and Justified:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer and explains our position without being confrontational. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our costs and the value we aim to provide, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved closer to our range, $9,500 is still above our ideal price. We have room to negotiate further, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, we need to signal that we're serious about a lower price without stalling the negotiation completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price ($8,750 is halfway between our previous offer and her last one) to show we're willing to compromise. 
* **Strong Justification:** Suggesting ""meeting in the middle"" frames our counter-offer as a fair compromise, encouraging Alice to do the same.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're still below our $10,000 walk-away point, giving us the flexibility to accept John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. After reviewing our costs and the value provided by the product, I am willing to agree on a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a $1,000 savings compared to John's offer.
* **Limited Time:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Continuing to push for a lower price might make Alice less willing to negotiate and risk losing the deal. 
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will go any lower, even if we reject this offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a worse outcome later."
