``` 
This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profit:** You're getting $500 more than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, showing he's serious. Holding out for more might make him walk away. 
* **Time:**  You're still in the early rounds, but dragging it out has risks. Secure the deal now.
