"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm starting at $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise,  and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work.  However, $950,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet halfway again - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe you'll be thrilled with the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I can tell we're getting closer to a deal. How about we land on $1,025,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
