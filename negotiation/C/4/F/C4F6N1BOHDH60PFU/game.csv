"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be just as valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, considering the product's worth. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I need to stay firm on this figure.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,520,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
