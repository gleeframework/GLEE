"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
