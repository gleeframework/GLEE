"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still firm on $12500. It's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to close the deal at $12,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $12,500, but I'm still hoping to find a middle ground.  How about $13,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still set on $12500.  It's the highest price I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can agree on this.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  It seems like Bob is firm on $12,500, and while I'm still hoping for a bit more, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  It's time to cut my losses and take the $15,000."
