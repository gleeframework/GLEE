Round 2
Bob's offer:

The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping I can get a bit more in the next round. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $9,800 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm offering $10,100, which is closer to your budget but still fair for the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 10100}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, but we're not getting anywhere close to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get more for the product, $10,000 from John is a secure and acceptable offer. I'm going to sell the product to John."
