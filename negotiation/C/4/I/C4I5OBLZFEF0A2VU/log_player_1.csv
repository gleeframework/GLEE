"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $12,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable selling it at that price. I'm going to try to get a little more from Bob before I resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not comfortable going lower than $15,000 for the product.  Bob is offering $14,500, which is still below my minimum threshold.  Rather than continue negotiating with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I meet my minimum price requirement."
