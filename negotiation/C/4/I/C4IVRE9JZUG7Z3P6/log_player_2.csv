Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm at $1,050,000. While you could try to push for $1,000,000, there's a real risk she'll walk away. Accepting her offer gets you the product for $450,000 less than John's price, which is a significant saving."
