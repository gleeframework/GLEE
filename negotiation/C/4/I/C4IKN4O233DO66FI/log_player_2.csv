Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go down to $100.  It's better to secure the product at your target price with John."
