Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again.  There's still a good chance of a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to settle for less than I can get."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
