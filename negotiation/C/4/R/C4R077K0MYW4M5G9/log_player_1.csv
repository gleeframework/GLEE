"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to be strategic, I cannot accept a price that undervalues my product. I will reject his offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept it.  If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John if he gets too low in his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not profitable enough. I'm confident that I can get a better price, so I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is a smaller drop than before, showing that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, it's still not where I need it to be. I'm willing to keep negotiating for a bit longer, as I believe we can still reach a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum price, so I'm making a smaller counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is my last offer before I start seriously considering John's offer.  I hope Bob realizes we're close to a deal and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting very close to my minimum, but they still fall short.  With only two rounds left, I need to act quickly to maximize my profit. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is above my minimum and ensures I don't risk losing out on a deal altogether."
