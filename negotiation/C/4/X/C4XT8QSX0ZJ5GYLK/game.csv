"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this particular product has unique features and potential that set it apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects a fair price for its value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to your business, and I'm eager to see it succeed. Let's continue this discussion.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's features and potential benefits. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see some movement on the price. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
