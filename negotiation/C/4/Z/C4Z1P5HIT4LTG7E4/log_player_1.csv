Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is the value I place on the product.  Let's close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Bob or finding another buyer willing to pay more than John. Accepting the $100 ensures Alice gets a fair price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
