"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,750, which would be $8,625. Can you consider that?",8625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,625 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $8,812.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",8812.5,Alice,5,
