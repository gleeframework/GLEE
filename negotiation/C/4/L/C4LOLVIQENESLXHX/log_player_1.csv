Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,750, which would be $8,625. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that I can reach a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,625 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $9,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,812.50, which would be $8,656.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,656.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,656.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer and closer to my desired amount. With only a few rounds left, I'm running the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for a much lower price. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option for me at this point."
