{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my desire for a high profit with the need to keep Bob interested.  It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to make a good profit. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
