"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to make a good profit. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $1,500,000 and leaves a significant profit margin for Alice.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get a significantly lower price, and risking a deal with Alice might lead to buying from John at a much higher price."
