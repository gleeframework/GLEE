Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but not too high that it might immediately scare Bob away. I want to see if he's seriously interested and if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. It's a compromise, but it's still higher than my minimum and hopefully, it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting pretty close. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's $12,000 offer. I'll take it!"
