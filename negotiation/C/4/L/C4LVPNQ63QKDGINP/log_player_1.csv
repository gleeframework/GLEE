{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially giving us a good middle ground.
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  This price is still significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000.
* **Building Rapport:**  Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Better Price:**  While John offers $15,000, there's a possibility that I can secure a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob. He's shown interest and acknowledged the product's value, making further negotiation worthwhile.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can present a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price reflects the product's worth while staying within a reasonable range for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $10,000 is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $10,000 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Reasoning and Appeal:**  I've provided a reason for my counteroffer (value of the product) and appealed to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Encouraging Further Negotiation:**  By using a question (""What do you think?""), I'm inviting Bob to continue the conversation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I still believe we can find a solution that suits both of us. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping it within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $9,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations might take more time and energy, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential benefit of a few extra hundred dollars is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's close to my minimum, minimizing potential losses and saving time and effort."
