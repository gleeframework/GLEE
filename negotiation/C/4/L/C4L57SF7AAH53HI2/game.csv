"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
