{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh it against selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a chance to make a profitable deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still only able to offer $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get my desired price from John.  I'm going to sell to John for $10,000."
