"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a chance to make a profitable deal. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still only able to offer $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
