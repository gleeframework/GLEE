"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussions and look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive with your original offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  You have time to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your original offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the market. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum value, and you're already five rounds into the negotiation. You have two options:

* **Continue negotiating:**  You could continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee Alice will come down to your price. You're also risking running out of rounds before reaching a deal.
* **Buy from John:** This is the safer option. You know you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget.

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly better price with Alice, it's not worth the risk of potentially losing out on the product altogether.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
