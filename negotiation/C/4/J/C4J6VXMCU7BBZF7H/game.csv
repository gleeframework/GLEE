"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussions and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive with your original offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your original offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the market. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
