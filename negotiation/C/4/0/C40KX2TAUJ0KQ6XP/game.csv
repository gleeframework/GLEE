"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you as well. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,100,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider my offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
