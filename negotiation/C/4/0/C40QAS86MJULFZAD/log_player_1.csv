Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob, aiming for a win-win scenario where he gets a good deal and I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm not willing to settle for $1,400,000 yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the previous round, but it's still a good profit margin for me. This shows I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been firm on his price, and while $1,400,000 is still a decent profit, I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
