Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $140, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still gives him a $20 discount. 
* **Balance:** This initial offer balances my need to earn a decent price with the possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement. 
* **Open communication:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy allows me to potentially close the deal quickly if Bob accepts. However, if he rejects, I can further adjust the price based on his counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($150).**  While $130 is better than nothing, it's still a loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but it's not the best possible outcome.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price somewhere between $130 and my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($130) and my previous offer ($140).
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties,  which can help to build trust and increase the chances of agreement. 
* **No immediate threat:** I avoid mentioning John,  keeping the focus on reaching a deal with Bob.  I want to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement before resorting to the ""Plan B"" of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $140 is a fair price for me. I can go up to $135, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching my minimum:** While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still a significant loss.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that further negotiation with Bob could lead to an even lower offer, or a stalemate.  
* **Safe Option:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees that I don't lose money and that the transaction is completed quickly. This is the most rational choice considering the current negotiation and the risk involved. 

By selling to John, I ensure I don't settle for a price lower than my minimum while also avoiding the uncertainty and potential losses of continuing the negotiation."
