"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  There are 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully get a better price."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her counteroffer of $1,080,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I've shown flexibility in my counteroffers, and there are still three rounds left.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not willing to buy from John at his high price yet."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not able to meet your price. I'm offering $1,060,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that is mutually beneficial. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is still too high for me.  We're down to the final round, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm also unwilling to risk losing the deal altogether.  Since John is willing to sell me the product for $1,500,000, I'll go ahead and buy it from him to ensure I get the product."
