"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $925,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's try $975,000. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up a bit. What if we settle on $950,000?  That's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
