Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $925,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his willingness to compromise, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my target price with continued negotiations, or I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's try $975,000. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up a bit. What if we settle on $950,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it seems like he's not willing to go higher than $950,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and saves me time and effort in further negotiations."
