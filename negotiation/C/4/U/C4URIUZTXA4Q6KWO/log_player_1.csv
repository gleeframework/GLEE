Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand, I'm proposing a price of $22,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers lined up."",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a high offer to Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.  Even if he negotiates down, you're more likely to land a price significantly higher than $15,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" adds a sense of scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. If you have the opportunity for multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers, the approach would be more nuanced."
