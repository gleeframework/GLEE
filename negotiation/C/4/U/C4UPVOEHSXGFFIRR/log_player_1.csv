Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $950,000 just yet.

This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
