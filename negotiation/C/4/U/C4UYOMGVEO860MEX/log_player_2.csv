"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We are starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $85 is still above our target. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you can't go as low as $70, Alice. How about we settle for $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

We're moving closer to Alice's likely bottom line while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $82, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we might get a slightly better deal with more rounds, $82 is a reasonable price and it's not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal."
