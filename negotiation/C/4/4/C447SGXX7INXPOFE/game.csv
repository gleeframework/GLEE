"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment of the product's value, I understand your budgetary constraints. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point balances both our interests.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,750,000.  I genuinely believe this price is fair, given the value of the product and my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
