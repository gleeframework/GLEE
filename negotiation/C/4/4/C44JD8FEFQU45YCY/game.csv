"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle on $760,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $810,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really tempting me. I'm willing to go a little higher, how about $780,000?  That's a significant investment for me.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to invest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell we both see the value in this deal. How about we split the difference and call it $800,000 even? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we've been dancing around the price for a while, Bob. I'm not willing to meet you at $800,000, but I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $815,000. That's my final offer.",815000.0,Alice,9,
