Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still reflects the significant value I believe this product holds."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. John guarantees the $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob."
