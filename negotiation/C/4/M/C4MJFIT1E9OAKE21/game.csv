"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $120 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $75? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. How about we split the difference again and settle at $97.5?  This feels like a fair compromise.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the compromise, $97.5 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we settle at $80? This would be my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
