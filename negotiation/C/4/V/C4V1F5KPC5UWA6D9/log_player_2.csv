"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should try to get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is trying to negotiate a price closer to his budget. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer but still leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Keeping it Open:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while making it clear that Bob wants a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but the product is worth significantly more to me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $10,000.
* **Negotiating space:**  Bob has room to negotiate further and try to bring the price down closer to his ideal.
* **John's offer:**  Buying from John for $10,000 is always an option, but Bob should continue trying to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I'm interested, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll have to consider purchasing from John."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing closer:**  This offer is a significant step closer to Bob's ideal price, showing he's serious about making a deal.
* **Final offer:** The message clearly indicates this is Bob's last offer. This creates pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale.
* **John's offer:** This subtly reminds Alice that Bob has another option, potentially increasing her motivation to accept."
