Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $60 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($60) puts pressure on her to negotiate. This establishes a lower price point for the product and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $50 is closer to my target, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 47}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $45 to $47. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range.  I'm hoping this small increase will entice Alice to accept, as it shows I'm serious about a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $55 is a good price, especially considering the negotiation history. It's lower than her initial offer, and I've already sent two counteroffers.  While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting at this point avoids risking further negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether.  It also keeps me from buying from John at a higher price."
