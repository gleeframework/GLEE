"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above the product's worth to you.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a lower counteroffer, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still above Alice's worth of $12,000, making it a reasonable offer for her to consider.  It's also a significant reduction from her initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is a good deal for me. It's still a little above the product's value to me, but it's much closer than her previous offer and significantly lower than John's price.  Continuing to negotiate could save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high at this point."
