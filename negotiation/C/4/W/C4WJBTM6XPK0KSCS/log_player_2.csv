"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price.  You have a backup option with John, so there's no rush to accept an offer above your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

Starting with a counteroffer of $7,500 is a good starting point. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. It leaves room for negotiation while showing that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but closer to your limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. You can always buy from John if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Since you have a guaranteed purchase option with John for $8,000, you can make a final counteroffer at that price.  This shows Alice that you're serious and willing to close the deal, but also sets your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is only $200 below your limit. It's very close to your desired price, but you've already had multiple rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk going any further.  It's better to buy from John at your limit to avoid the risk of further haggling and potential price increases."
