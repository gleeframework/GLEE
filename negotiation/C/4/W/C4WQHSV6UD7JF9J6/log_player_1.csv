"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is an aggressive opening, but it gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a price that's good for me. Since Bob is only willing to pay $800,000, he's likely to counteroffer. This will give me a better understanding of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than his initial willingness to pay, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as he's showing a willingness to compromise, and I might be able to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still keeps me well above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I can encourage Bob to come up with a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, as there are still rounds left and I believe I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,700,000. This is another compromise from my previous offer, but it keeps me in a strong position.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign that I'm serious about reaching a deal and will be willing to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm concerned that we are running out of rounds.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
