# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims it's a ""significant saving"" compared to a $1,200,000 market value, you know you can get it for $1,200,000 from John.  Don't fall for her sales tactics."
