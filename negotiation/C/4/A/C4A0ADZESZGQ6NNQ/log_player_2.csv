# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I don't want to accept right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000, considering my budget and the market value. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me some room to negotiate further while still leaving a good margin for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $750000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to go that low just yet. Given the unique value proposition of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects a significant discount, but still ensures I receive a fair return on my investment. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which reflects a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  This offer shows that I'm serious about closing the deal while still staying within my budget.  I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a fair compromise."
