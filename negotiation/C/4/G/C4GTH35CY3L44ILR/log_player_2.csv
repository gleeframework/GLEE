"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He wants to save as much money as possible and $10,000 is still too high.  He can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,500 is a better price than the initial $10,000, he can still try to get a lower price.  He should counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  Let's compromise again at $9250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
