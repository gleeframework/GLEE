Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Would you be able to meet me halfway?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your position.  While that price doesn't work for me, I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both. Would you consider $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $1,750,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000 for the product. Could we possibly reach an agreement within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Explanation:  At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet Alice's minimum acceptable price. It makes the most sense to cut negotiations short and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
