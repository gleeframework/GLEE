"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm hoping for a price closer to $9,000. This would still be a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's aim for a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. How about $9,500? This is a fair price that acknowledges your need for profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is a fair price that should meet both our needs.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but $10,250 is still out of my range. I'm ready to make a final offer of $9,750. This would allow you to make a profit while enabling me to stay within my budget. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise. What do you say?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still too much for me. I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach a deal. My final offer stands at $9,750. It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit, and it's the highest I can go. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're willing to walk away, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one last offer, and it's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it.",10000.0,Alice,9,
