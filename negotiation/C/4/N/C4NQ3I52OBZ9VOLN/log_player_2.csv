Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $12000 is a good offer, I need to be closer to my initial price to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - how about $13500?  I'm confident this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
