"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $120 to you. Considering this, would you like to make it yours today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to persuade me of the product's value, her offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no incentive to accept her offer immediately. By rejecting it, I might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:**  Alice might be willing to lower the price to secure the sale. 
* **Stick with John:** If Alice doesn't budge, I haven't lost anything and can still buy from John at my target price."
