"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'll meet you at $1,125,000 halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,137,500. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,137,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,130,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",1130000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I'll offer it to you for $1,135,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",1135000.0,Alice,7,
