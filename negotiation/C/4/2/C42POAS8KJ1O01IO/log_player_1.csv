Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value and what it's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
