This offer is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  It's a strong opening offer that demonstrates my belief in the product's value while leaving room for flexibility."

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe there is still room for negotiation.  I will counteroffer to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."

I'm willing to lower my price slightly from my initial offer, but I still believe this product is worth more than $12,000. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still striving for a price that reflects the product's value."

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous offer, and it's very close to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a price that's more than acceptable."
