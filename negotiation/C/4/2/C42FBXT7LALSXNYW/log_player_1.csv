Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and creates the perception of the product being highly valuable.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you (which could weaken your position), the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies it's worth a significant amount. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** By mentioning you'll list the product publicly, you indirectly signal to Bob that he's not your only option, adding a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price that's beneficial for both parties."
