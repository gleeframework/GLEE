Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **High but Justifiable:** The offer is high but justifiable given you know the product's worth to Bob is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price."
