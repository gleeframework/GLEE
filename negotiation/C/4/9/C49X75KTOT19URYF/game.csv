"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000.  This price allows both of us to walk away happy.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,550,000 is closer than before, I still can't justify spending that much. I would like to propose $1,500,000 as a compromise, which respects your valuation while keeping costs reasonable for me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
