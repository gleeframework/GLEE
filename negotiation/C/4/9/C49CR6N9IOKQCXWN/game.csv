"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product at a price of $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm sure you'll find it worthwhile. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite low considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can get that price from another interested buyer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
