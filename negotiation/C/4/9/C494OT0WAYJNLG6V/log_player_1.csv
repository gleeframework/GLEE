Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this accurately reflects its worth and potential for return. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both parties, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value,"" Alice aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a secure fallback option with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept an offer below her minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's potential interest at a price point above the minimum."
