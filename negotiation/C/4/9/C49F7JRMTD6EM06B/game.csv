"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
