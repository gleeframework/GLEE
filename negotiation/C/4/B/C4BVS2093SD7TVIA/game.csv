"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $1350000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at the moment.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1350000 is your highest offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
