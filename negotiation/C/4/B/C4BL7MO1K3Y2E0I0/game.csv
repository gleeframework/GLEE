"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,550,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,550,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,550,000, so I'll offer $1,425,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,425,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
