"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum and John's offer. It's important to demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate but not desperate. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However,  $850,000 falls quite short of what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are making a significant concession to signal willingness to negotiate, but still staying well above both Bob's initial offer and our reserve price. This keeps the pressure on Bob while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of your product, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant step towards your price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy. However, $950,000 is still less than John's guaranteed offer. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on Bob while allowing us to aim for a price closer to, or even above, $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find common ground.  To show I'm serious about making this work, I'll come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're now strategically positioning ourselves above John's offer. By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make his best move.  This approach aims to maximize our potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now presented his ""final offer,"" and it remains below John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him not increasing his offer further, or even walking away. Accepting John's offer secures the guaranteed $1,000,000 and avoids the potential for a less profitable outcome with Bob."
