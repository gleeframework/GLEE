"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $95? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $105 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $98. Let's finalize this deal and be done with it.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $98. I'll make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Alice,7,
