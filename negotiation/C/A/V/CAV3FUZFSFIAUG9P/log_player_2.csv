"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $95
* **Your Value:** $100
* **John's Price:** $100

You can get the product from John for the same price as Alice's offer, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
