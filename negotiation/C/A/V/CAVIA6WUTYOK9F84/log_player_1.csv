Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Maximizing Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows me (Alice) to potentially secure a higher profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob counters my initial offer, there's a chance to negotiate and still sell the product above my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Backup Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $10,000, ensuring I won't lose out if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits.
*  If I had additional information, I might adjust my strategy accordingly."
