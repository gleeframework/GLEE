"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for negotiation.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $14,250? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",14000.0,Bob,6,
