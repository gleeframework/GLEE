"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is closer to my initial offer and represents a significant savings for you.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $815000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
