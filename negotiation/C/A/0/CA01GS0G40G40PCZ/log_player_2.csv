{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can save $250,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is a guaranteed option, you have room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still being above her minimum desired price. This leaves room for further negotiation, while also showing Alice that you are serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher than your previous offer, it is still below her initial price, showing that she is willing to negotiate. You can potentially negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer. Buying from John at this point would cost you $225,000 more than Alice's current offer. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's a move towards her price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but it still offers a substantial saving compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her price, signaling that she's unlikely to budge much further.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are shrinking. Buying from John guarantees a price within your budget, and the time and effort spent on further negotiation may not be worth the potential savings."
