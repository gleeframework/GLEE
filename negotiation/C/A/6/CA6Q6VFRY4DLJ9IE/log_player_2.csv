"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made her final offer at $900,000. While this is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's a fair deal considering the product's value to Bob is $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer could lead to a stalemate or a higher price from John. Accepting the offer secures a valuable asset at a price that is still significantly lower than John's offer."
