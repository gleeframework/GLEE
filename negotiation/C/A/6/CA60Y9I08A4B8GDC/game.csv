"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
