"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but still aim for a price that's closer to my desired value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if Bob continues to refuse, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm lowering my price to my minimum, hoping this will finally convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John, as I'm not willing to go lower."
