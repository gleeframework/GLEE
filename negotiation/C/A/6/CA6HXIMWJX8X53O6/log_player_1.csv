"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a fair price.  My initial offer is $120."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets the expectation that you're willing to work with Bob to find a price that's fair for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm a bit tight on budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80 from John, we can likely do better. We'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little above that price point. How about $110? It's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's above our minimum of $80 and not too far from our desired price. Accepting his offer ensures we make a profit and close the deal."
