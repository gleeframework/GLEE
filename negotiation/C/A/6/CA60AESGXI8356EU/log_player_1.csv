"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly higher than my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential""  aims to frame the product as highly desirable and worth a premium price.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the investment potential can make the offer more appealing. 

This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option of John's offer as a strong backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to find a deal that works for both of us, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have John's offer as a safety net.  I'll use the next round to counter and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can drop to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Budget but Reiterate Value:** I want to show Bob I understand his position but also emphasize that my price is tied to the product's inherent worth. 
* **Significant Drop, But Still Strong:**  Reducing the price by $300,000 is a substantial move designed to encourage Bob while still staying well above both his budget and my minimum.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  Framing the negotiation as a win-win situation helps foster a more collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a considerable investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly increased his offer, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, $1,200,000 is still $300,000 less than what John is offering. It's worth continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds to see if I can bridge the gap further. I'll aim for a counteroffer that encourages Bob to move closer to the $1,500,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I value that. While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, we're still apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true value of this unique product and my desire to strike a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress, But Stand Firm:** I want to recognize Bob's improved offer, showing him I'm engaged, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to drop below a certain point.
* **Strategic Concession:** Lowering my price by $250,000 is another significant move.  This signals flexibility on my part but keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to my range.
* **Reiterate Value and Fairness:**  By reiterating the product's value and my desire for a fair deal, I'm subtly reminding Bob that $1,200,000 is likely underselling the product's potential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better offer. 

Here's why accepting now makes sense:

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,400,000 is a substantial amount and represents a good return on the product, even if it's slightly less than John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I receive the payment sooner.  Delaying for a potentially small increase with Bob has an opportunity cost.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a chance that negotiations could break down, leaving me to go back to John (who might not be available indefinitely).  Accepting a strong offer now minimizes this risk.

Overall, while I believe the product is worth more, taking the $1,400,000 offer from Bob at this point strikes a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
