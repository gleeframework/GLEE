"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $95 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
