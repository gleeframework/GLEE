"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $95 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
