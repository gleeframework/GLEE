"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows some room for negotiation.  It's important to be friendly and encouraging while also starting with a strong offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me. I can come down a bit more, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about $95? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made the same offer again, and I'm running out of rounds. While $90 is still less than my ideal price, it's close enough and allows me to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer is the best option in this scenario."
