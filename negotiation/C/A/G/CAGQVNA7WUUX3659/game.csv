"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $9,000 is a good starting point,  it's a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
