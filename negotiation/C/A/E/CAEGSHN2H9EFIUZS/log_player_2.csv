"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's highly likely that Alice is willing to sell for much lower than her initial offer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to explore a better price. Buying from John right now would be a huge waste of potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong negotiating tactic to show that I'm serious about a lower price and to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  I'm assuming a 50% discount is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm willing to pay $15,000 elsewhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, I'm still confident we can negotiate a better price.  There's still room to bargain, and I don't want to settle too quickly.  I'll counteroffer again to try to inch closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer by $500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a favorable price. This incremental approach maintains momentum in the negotiation without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $4,200, which is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  It's time to accept the offer, securing a good deal and ensuring I get the product."
