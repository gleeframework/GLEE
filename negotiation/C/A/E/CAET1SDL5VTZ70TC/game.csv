"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as you'd still make a good profit, and I'd get a great deal.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer the product for $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This would allow you to get a good price for your product and would be a great deal for me.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still trying to get a fair price for my product. While I appreciate your offer, $875,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiations.",890000.0,Alice,5,
