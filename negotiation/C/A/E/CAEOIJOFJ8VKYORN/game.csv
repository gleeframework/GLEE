"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe my initial offer is closer to the true worth of this product considering its long-term benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
