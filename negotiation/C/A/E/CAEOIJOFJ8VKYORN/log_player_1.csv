"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe my initial offer is closer to the true worth of this product considering its long-term benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still in a position where we would be losing money compared to John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will reach $15,000 in the remaining rounds, and it makes more financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer."
