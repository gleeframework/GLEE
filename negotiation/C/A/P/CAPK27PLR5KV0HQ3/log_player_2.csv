"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and can try to get a price closer to our target.  Buying from John right away would be settling for our maximum price without even trying to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:** We're starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Polite & Direct:** The message is friendly while clearly stating our price target. This avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.
* **Leaving Room:** We've left a significant gap between our offer and Alice's asking price, signaling that we're willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $8,500 is still above our $8,000 maximum budget.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. We've made progress, and there's a good chance we can get closer to our target price with another counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:** We can always fall back on buying from John at $8,000 if the negotiations don't go our way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $7,000?  I think that would be a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious but staying well below her current price to encourage further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  We're providing a brief reason (""a bit of a stretch"") to reinforce our position without being overly aggressive.
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:**  Our goal is to gradually move towards a price point somewhere between our initial offer and her last counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Budget:** Alice has met our maximum budget of $8,000.
* **No Guarantee of Lower:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, especially since she called this her ""final offer.""
* **Equal to John:**  We could get the same price from John, so there's no benefit to delaying further. 

We've successfully negotiated a price that meets our budget!"
