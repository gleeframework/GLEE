Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to negotiate.
