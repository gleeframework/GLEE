"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price seems a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $800,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest,  $720,000 is where I would need to be to make this work.  Does that seem feasible to you?",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
