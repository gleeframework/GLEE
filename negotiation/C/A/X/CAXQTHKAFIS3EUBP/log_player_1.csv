Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you can still come down slightly while staying above your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the ""value"" aims to frame the price as justified, even if Bob perceives the worth as lower. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value.
* **Single Offer:** You only get one shot with Bob.  A very high offer might scare him off without a chance to negotiate."
