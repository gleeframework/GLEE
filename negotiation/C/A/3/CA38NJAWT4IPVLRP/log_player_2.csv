Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While there's always a chance she might go lower, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John at $800,000 is too high.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
