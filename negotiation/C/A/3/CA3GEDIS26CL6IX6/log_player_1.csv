"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point considering the product's value to both of us. I'm confident that I can get a higher price if Bob rejects, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with $92.50. This is a compromise, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that still allows me to profit comfortably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I could do $88, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $88 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not sure if he's willing to go any higher. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $88 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a small concession from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. It's also a price that's still profitable for me, but closer to Bob's offer. This should hopefully encourage him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  I could meet you halfway at $89, but that's really the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm still a little disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my ideal price, $89 is a solid offer and only $1 less than my minimum. With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
