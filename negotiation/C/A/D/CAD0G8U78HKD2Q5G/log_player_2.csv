"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $140, which is less than the $150 John is asking.
* **The product is worth it to you:** You value the product at $150, and Alice's offer is within your budget. 

It's better to accept Alice's offer and save $10 compared to buying from John."
