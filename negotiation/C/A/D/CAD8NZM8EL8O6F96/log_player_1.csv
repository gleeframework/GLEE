"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential value.  While $950,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm rejecting his offer to keep the negotiation going and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum desired price.  I believe this price point is reasonable and gives Bob an incentive to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $875,000. This is a significant concession, showing a genuine willingness to compromise.  However, it still leaves room for profit and is above my minimum desired price. I believe this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already gone through several rounds and I'm running out of time. To guarantee a sale and ensure I don't lose out on any profit, I'm going to sell the product to John."
