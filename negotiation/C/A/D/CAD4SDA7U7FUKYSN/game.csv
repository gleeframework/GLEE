"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,500,000 is simply too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value finding common ground,  $900,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to move down to $1,300,000. I believe this adjustment demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
