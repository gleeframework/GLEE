"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup and not a good deal for Bob.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value finding common ground,  $900,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to move down to $1,300,000. I believe this adjustment demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum value. He should counteroffer again to try and get closer to his target price."
