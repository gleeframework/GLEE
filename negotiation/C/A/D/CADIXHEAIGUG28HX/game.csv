"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low. My final offer is $14,000.  This is a great price for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I could do $13,000, but that's really the most I can offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
