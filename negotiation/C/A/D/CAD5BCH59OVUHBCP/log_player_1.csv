Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth without being too pushy.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""what do you think?""  invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in a dialogue.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price. You can gradually lower it, but never go below your $12,000 minimum as you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
