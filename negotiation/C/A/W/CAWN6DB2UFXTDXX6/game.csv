"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a good compromise. Let's try to make this deal work.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,900?  It's a small adjustment that could help us close this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
