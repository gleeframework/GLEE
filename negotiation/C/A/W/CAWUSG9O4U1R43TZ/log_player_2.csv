"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the minimum she's willing to accept.  It's still too high for Bob, who has a maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth negotiating to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, as it gives you a healthy profit margin while also allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth, while also being a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what Bob is comfortable paying. Bob should continue negotiating and see if he can get the price down further.  There are still many rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her minimum price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept as it's a lower price than John's offer, Bob still has room to negotiate.  Since he only has 5 rounds left, it's important to try and get the price down further.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a serious offer and reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price, as we're both getting closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has three rounds left.  While Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price, it's closer to his budget than John's offer.  It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and there's a risk that if Bob rejects the offer, he may be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  By accepting, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a higher cost."
