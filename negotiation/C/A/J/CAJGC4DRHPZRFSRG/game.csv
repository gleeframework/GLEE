"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,300,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to secure a fair price for the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and my minimum acceptable value. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've done some research and found out that the market value for this product is closer to $1,200,000. Considering this, I'd like to propose $1,300,000 as a fair price. I hope this proposal will be more in line with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
