Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really find useful. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $140 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), so there's room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you can still potentially increase the price, or lower it a bit if necessary. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible without risking him rejecting your offer altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best move in this scenario:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is still higher than your minimum selling price of $120. 
* **It's a quick sale:**  You avoid the potential for further negotiations that could take longer and might lead to a lower price or even a stalemate.
* **It secures a profit:** While it's not the highest possible price, it guarantees you a profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for $120. 

Even though you could try to counteroffer for a higher price, it's likely that Bob will either refuse or come back with a lower offer.  Accepting his offer is the most pragmatic choice to secure a good deal in a timely manner."
