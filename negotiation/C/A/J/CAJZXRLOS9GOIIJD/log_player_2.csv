# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $8,000."
