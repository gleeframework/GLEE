"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $10000. I am willing to offer $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $9750.  This would be a fair compromise and ensure both of us get a good deal. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective and appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $9600 for the product. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9600.0,Bob,4,
