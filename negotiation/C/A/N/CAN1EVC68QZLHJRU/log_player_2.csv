"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower counteroffer. This leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately commit to a high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $700,000, I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value ($800,000) while staying well below my maximum budget. 
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a chance Alice might accept this offer outright. If not, there's still room to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice has moved towards my initial offer, but $875,000 is still a significant amount above her perceived value of the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding a Rushed Decision:** While Alice wants to ""meet in the middle"", a more gradual approach might yield a better outcome.  I don't want to accept a price I might regret later.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having the option to buy from John at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably, I have a fallback option."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of a drastic jump, I'm increasing my offer by $75,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $775,000 is a price point that is hopefully attractive enough for Alice to consider seriously while remaining significantly below my maximum and John's offer.
* **Projecting Fairness:**  By framing the offer as mutually beneficial, I'm hoping to create a more collaborative tone in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $775,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, and $825,000 is a reasonable price considering her perceived value of $800,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, and there's a risk that Alice could walk away from the deal.
* **Saving Compared to John:** Accepting this offer saves $175,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving. 

At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are likely outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
