"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return you'll see.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $775,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
