I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for some negotiation room. I'm confident that Bob will reject this initial offer, which will give me an opportunity to assess his interest and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob has shown a willingness to pay only my minimum price, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge further.  John is offering my minimum, and it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
