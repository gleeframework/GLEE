Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

It's far too expensive.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's start with this and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering the immense potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's keep working on this."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to continue the negotiation, but  $1,300,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you $1,100,000? This is a fair price, and I believe it allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, splitting the difference is a common tactic to find a fair agreement.  Let's do that, but from my previous offer. I'd be willing to accept $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
