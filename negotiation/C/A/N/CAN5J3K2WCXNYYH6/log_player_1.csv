Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's start with this and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering the immense potential this product holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to continue the negotiation, but  $1,300,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you $1,100,000? This is a fair price, and I believe it allows us to both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, we're still in early rounds of negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to go above his initial offer. Holding firm for another round is a strategic move to potentially secure an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, splitting the difference is a common tactic to find a fair agreement.  Let's do that, but from my previous offer. I'd be willing to accept $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,200,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we go with $1,150,000? This is a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer and is now at $1,150,000.  While we might be able to squeeze out a little more, it's getting riskier. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or time running out."
