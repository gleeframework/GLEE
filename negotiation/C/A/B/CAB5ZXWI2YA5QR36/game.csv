"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 was a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Would you be open to discussing $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the conversation! I can see that we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. I think that's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal quickly, how about we settle at $12,000? It's a win-win for both of us!",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to hold firm on this price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to continue discussing, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",12500.0,Alice,7,
