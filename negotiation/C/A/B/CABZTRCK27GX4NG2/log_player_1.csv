Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation.  We'll aim to nudge Bob closer to our desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for your specific needs, is substantial.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial price. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,380,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000.

We are getting close, but Bob is moving slowly. We need to increase the pressure a bit to move the price closer to $1,400,000."

Bob didn't respond to the pressure tactic and is too far from our near-final offer.  We need to signal we're serious about walking away to push the price up or take John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've tried to be flexible, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  I'm willing to consider $1,385,000, but this is absolutely my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I have another buyer ready at a lower price, and I'll need to move forward with them."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,378,000. I hope this offer will allow us to conclude our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,378,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  He's unlikely to move much higher, and while it's less than we hoped for, $1,378,000 is still a good price, considerably more than John's $1,200,000 offer.  It's better to secure a solid deal now than risk pushing Bob away in pursuit of a potentially unattainable figure."
