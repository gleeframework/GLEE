"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by many of our customers. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it today? I'm open to discussing different pricing options to ensure you feel satisfied with your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is quite high. While she expresses flexibility, there's a good chance you can get a better price by:

* **Negotiating:**  Rejecting her first offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to your budget.
* **Going with John:** Your fallback option of buying from John for $100 is still better than paying $95."
