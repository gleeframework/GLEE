Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm asking for $1,190,000, reflecting its true worth and potential. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed backup offer at $1,200,000, Alice should aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product slightly below John's price allows room for Bob to counter-offer. This keeps the door open for a deal while still prioritizing a high sale price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message uses positive language to highlight the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to the high price."
