"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $9,000 for the product?  I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'll meet you at $9,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
