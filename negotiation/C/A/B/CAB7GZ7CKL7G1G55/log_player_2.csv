"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $9,500 is better than John's price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $9,000 for the product?  I think that's a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'll meet you at $9,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, and Alice's offer of $9,250 is significantly lower.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the difference is only $250.  
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, he runs the risk of Alice raising the price again or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure a good deal while minimizing potential risk."
