Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob. Rejecting and counter-offering allows for the possibility of getting closer to the $12,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate but not give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close enough to my desired price range and significantly higher than selling to John. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
