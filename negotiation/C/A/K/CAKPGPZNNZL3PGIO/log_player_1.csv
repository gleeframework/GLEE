Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
