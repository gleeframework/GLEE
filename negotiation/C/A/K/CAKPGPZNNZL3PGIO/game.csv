"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me.",160.0,Alice,3,
