Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your latest offer, how about we settle on $113? This is slightly above your offer but still within my comfort zone. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $113 is getting close to my limit, but it's still outside of my comfort zone.  I've been negotiating with Alice for several rounds, and while she's been willing to compromise, she's not willing to meet my desired price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $100. This guarantees that I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
