"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $14,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more to you than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more. How about $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
