"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'd be happy to accept $1,250,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
