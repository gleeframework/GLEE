Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum value of $120, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, making the deal attractive to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate further, potentially raising the price closer to $150. 

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with maintaining the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum value of $120, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves you with very little profit.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your negotiating position:** By rejecting, you signal that you're not willing to settle for a low price and are prepared to continue negotiating.
* **Potentially increase the price:**  You can now make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.

**Next steps:**

You should make a counteroffer that is higher than $110 but lower than your original $140.  For example, you could offer $125, explaining that it's a fair compromise that still allows you to make a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is exactly your minimum acceptable price, meaning you would make no profit but wouldn't lose any money either.  Since this is your minimum value, accepting his offer is the most logical choice:

* **No profit, but no loss:** You avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection, which could lead to selling to John for the same price but with more time and effort invested.
* **Swift and easy transaction:** Accepting allows you to close the deal quickly and move on to other opportunities.

While further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, there's no guarantee of success.  Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most risk-averse and efficient option."
