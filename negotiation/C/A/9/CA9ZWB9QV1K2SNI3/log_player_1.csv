Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $170. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't possible in a real negotiation:**  In a real-world scenario, I wouldn't know Bob values the product at $100. My goal is to aim for the highest price possible without pushing him away.
* **Starting high:**  $170 is a strong opening, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting above my minimum, I signal I'm open to negotiation, which might make Bob more comfortable countering.
* **Justification:** My message implies the product's value, making a higher price more palatable.

**Important Note:** If I get the sense that Bob is very price-sensitive or there's no room for negotiation, I might adjust my approach in a follow-up."
