"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $120 offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go even higher in the next round. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not in a huge hurry to close this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102} 
```

I'm going to counter with $102. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to accept. I'm still very close to my minimum price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $98 is tempting, I'm still holding out for my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I've already gotten pretty close to that, and I think I can get Bob to agree to it in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $100. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe Bob is likely to accept it. I've already rejected a couple of offers close to this price, so I'm hoping he realizes that I'm serious about getting at least $100."
