(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached the end of our negotiation with Alice. It's clear that she's not willing to go lower than $750,000. While this is a decent price, it's still a significant amount of money, and we've already spent several rounds trying to get a better deal. It's better to buy from John at this point and avoid the risk of going through another round with Alice and potentially losing time and the opportunity to secure the product altogether."
