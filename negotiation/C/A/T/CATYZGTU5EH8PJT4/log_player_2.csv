"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $120. I think you'll find it's a steal at this value! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer gives more room for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it shows you're serious about buying but need a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is quite low for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay. There's room to negotiate further down towards your $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price considering the value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**  This counter-offer moves closer to Alice's price while still leaving some room for negotiation before hitting your $80 limit. By framing it as a ""fair price"" that considers both sides, it might encourage Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I can't go lower than $85. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has given you her final offer, and it's still above your maximum budget.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, which aligns with your goal of saving money. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the sure deal with John."
