Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth while also offering you a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Deal:** While I could start higher, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. $11,500 is a strong starting point that balances profit with the need to secure the sale.
* **Backup Option:**  I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so I won't accept anything less than that."
