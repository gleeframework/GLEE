"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1000000 is a bit outside my budget at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, given its unique features. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the unique features it offers. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $875000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $800000 for this unique product.  I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $900000. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I believe this is a fair price. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $890000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $890000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $850000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,6,
