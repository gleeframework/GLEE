"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we settle on $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,100,000. I'm confident we can both be happy with that deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by going from $1,100,000 to $1,150,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a personalized setup service. How about we stick with $1,150,000 and I'll add these extras to the deal?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
