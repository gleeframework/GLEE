"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save $1,500 by going with John."
