"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your valuation of $10000, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. Considering your initial valuation of $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. I'm offering a new price of $11000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your new offer. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9500. I'm willing to make a new offer that's closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a new price of $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between our previous offers, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
