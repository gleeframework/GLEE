"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $90. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm happy to take my business elsewhere.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $102.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $96.25?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",96.25,Bob,6,
