"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 seems a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met my maximum price, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate a better price. Accepting the offer now guarantees I get the product."
