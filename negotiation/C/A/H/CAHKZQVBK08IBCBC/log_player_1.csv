Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,800,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
