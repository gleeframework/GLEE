"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point represents a fair and reasonable offer for both of us.
