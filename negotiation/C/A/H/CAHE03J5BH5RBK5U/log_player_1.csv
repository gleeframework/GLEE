"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value, but leaving some room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about selling but also open to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a significant margin for myself.  I'm hoping that this compromise will encourage Bob to move further towards my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is stubborn and hasn't moved from his previous offer.  While I'm tempted to take the $9,500, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll risk another round and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm dropping the price again, but only slightly. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position.  I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to move closer to my desired price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a small improvement, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I have four rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm making one final concession to try to get Bob to accept.  This is a very small difference from his last offer, and I'm hoping he'll see it as a sign of good faith.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid risking further losses in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been stubbornly refusing to budge further.  It's getting very close to the end of our negotiation, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer than John's.  It's time to cut my losses and accept the sure thing with John."
