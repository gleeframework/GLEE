"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $7,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm now offering it to you for $7,200.

"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100, but I need to make a small profit. I'm offering it to you for $7,150. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",7150.0,Alice,7,
