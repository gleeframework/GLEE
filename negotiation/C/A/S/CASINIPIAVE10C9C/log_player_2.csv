Alice's offer is closer to what I want, but I can still try to push for a lower price. It's worth negotiating further."

Alice's offer is a significant improvement and is within my acceptable price range. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the product to John outweighs the potential savings."
