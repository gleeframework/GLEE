Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 (to John).
* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible without going over, as that would make Bob reject the offer.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering a price of $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 

By starting high, but below Bob's perceived value, you increase your chances of securing the best possible price."
