"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I have 10 rounds, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'll try to get closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  My product is worth more than $9,000, and I'm still open to selling it to you.  Let's try $10,500.  That's a good compromise and gives you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $12,000, it's still a bit below it.  I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,250 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet at $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell at this price. I've already offered a compromise of $11,000 and I believe there is still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to try to get a better price with a counter-offer in the next round.  I still have 4 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,900.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds left, the chances of getting a higher offer from Bob are diminishing. Bob has consistently offered below my minimum price, and it seems unlikely he will reach my desired price.  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my minimum desired value and guarantees a sale.  It's a safer option than risking a rejection from Bob and having to start over with another potential buyer."
