"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in acquiring it, but I'm only able to offer $600000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to consider that?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $750000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product, and it's the most I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $750000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and my target price. How about we aim for $825000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
