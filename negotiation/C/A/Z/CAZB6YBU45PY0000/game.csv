"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but $13,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's worth and your budget constraints.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm firm at $14,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000, as it's still below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15500.0,Alice,5,
