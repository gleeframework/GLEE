"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always adjust downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my desired price. While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept and secure a good price rather than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for $12,000."
