"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your Value:** You value the product at $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **John's Price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $20 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, it's likely she wouldn't go lower than her $80 value."
