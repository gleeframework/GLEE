Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to him. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, which means going above $800,000.  However, you need to leave some ""room"" in the deal so Bob feels like he's getting a fair price and is motivated to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" can add perceived value.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting ""unique value and potential"" subtly justifies a higher price.
* **""Fair"" Price:**  By stating you believe it's a fair offer, you aim to anchor Bob's perception around that value. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The $75,000 markup allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could start higher and be prepared to negotiate more aggressively, or use other tactics depending on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style."
