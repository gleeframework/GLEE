"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. This is a great deal, considering its value and quality. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me, but $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about we meet in the middle at $150?  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $150. How about we try $175? This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $160.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",160.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we try $170? This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",170.0,Alice,5,
