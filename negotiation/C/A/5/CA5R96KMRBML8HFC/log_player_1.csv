"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it could benefit you greatly. I'm initially offering it for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer helps gauge Bob's seriousness. A quick acceptance might mean we could have gone higher. Strong resistance might suggest we need to adjust our strategy quickly. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our valuation and his own stated value of $1,000,000. Accepting this would leave a lot of money on the table. We have room to negotiate, and John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're coming down from our initial offer, but not drastically. This counter-offer still leans in our favor but shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:** By staying above $1,000,000, we reinforce the idea that this is a high-value product. We don't want to get drawn too far down by Bob's initial lowball offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** We have 10 rounds, so we can afford to be a bit more aggressive in the early stages.  We can adjust our strategy if Bob remains resistant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $900,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Bob's statement about a ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic to try and pressure us. It's still early in the negotiation, and we have leverage.
* **Slow Progress:** While Bob has moved up from his initial offer, the increments are small. We need to signal that we're serious about a higher price. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 means we don't have to settle for anything less. 

We'll reject Bob's offer, but our next counter-offer should signal a willingness to be more flexible to keep Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's real value.  Let's settle this right now -  $1,100,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer shows flexibility but sets a clear floor at a price significantly above John's offer.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** Phrases like ""settle this right now"" can sometimes nudge a negotiation towards a close, especially if Bob is genuinely interested.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate (Slightly):**  While this offer is presented as our best, we've left a little wiggle room in case Bob counters very close to $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's offer is only incrementally better, and he's using the ""final offer"" tactic again. This suggests he's unlikely to move significantly closer to our desired price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost.  Each round increases the risk of him walking away or us accepting a price too low. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **Bird in Hand:** The adage ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" applies. While we might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, it's not worth risking the $1,000,000 we can get from John right now."
