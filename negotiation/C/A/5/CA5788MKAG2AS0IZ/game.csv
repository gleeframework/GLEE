"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $22,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $19,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value of the product, $19,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm offering $15,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it gives you a chance to close the deal. ",15500.0,Bob,4,
