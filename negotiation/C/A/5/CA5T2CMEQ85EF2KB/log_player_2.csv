"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $100. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer slightly above Alice's value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation but signals I'm looking for a significant discount.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite and frame the counteroffer as reasonable.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I'm prepared to go up a little if Alice rejects this offer, but I want to see how she responds first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $92 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but $92 is still above my target. I believe there's room for further negotiation, so I'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Alice came down to $92, and my previous offer was $85. Offering $88 represents a compromise and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Sense of Urgency (Slight):** While I'm willing to continue negotiating, I want to gently nudge things along.  Suggesting a middle ground can signal I'm getting closer to my limit. 
* **Still Below Budget:** This offer keeps me well below my $120 maximum and provides a buffer for a potential final counter from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $90 for the product. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $90, which is only $10 above her value and a good price for me. 
* **Limited Time:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, and further haggling might not yield much better results. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential savings from pushing further are relatively small compared to the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation stalling."
