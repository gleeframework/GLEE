"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I can go up to $9,250. How about we try $8,800? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. $8,800 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $9,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while still being within my range. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
