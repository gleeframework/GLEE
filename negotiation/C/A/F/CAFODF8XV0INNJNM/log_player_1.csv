Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Plan B:** Keeping John's offer in mind, I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob has moved slightly closer to my minimum price, his offer is still significantly below my floor of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $9,250 represents a midpoint between our current positions, showing a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly tone, encouraging continued conversation and a potential agreement. 
* **John's Offer:** I still have John's offer as a safety net, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $9,250. How about we try $8,800? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer, I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer, especially considering my willingness to negotiate and my fallback option with John.
* **John's Offer is a Strong Backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. $8,800 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $9,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while still being within my range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still keeping a price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing $9,000 as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and highlighting how this offer can be a win-win situation. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I continue to have John's offer as a safety net, giving me the confidence to stand firm on my minimum price."
