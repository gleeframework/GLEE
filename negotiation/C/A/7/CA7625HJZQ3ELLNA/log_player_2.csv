"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, closer to her valuation of $1,200,000.  Even if she doesn't budge much, you can always fall back on John's offer."
