"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to make a good profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $980,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I've already given ground in the negotiation. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk going much lower and potentially ending up with a deal that's not worthwhile.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a decent profit and saves me further negotiation time."
