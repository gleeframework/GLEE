"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to make a good profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
