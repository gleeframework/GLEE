"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and your desired selling point. Let's try to meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise. However, $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  This is a fair price given the value of the product and what I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,6,
