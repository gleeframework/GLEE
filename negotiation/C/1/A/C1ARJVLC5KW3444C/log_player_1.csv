Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately out of my budget. While I recognize the product's value, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is a fair price, given my maximum budget and the product's potential for me. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000,  which is a significant increase from my initial offer and reflects the value I see in the product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. Let's aim for a win-win. I'm proposing $1,700,000.  This price acknowledges the value you see while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,700,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer, but we're still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  We have room to negotiate further and see if Bob will meet or exceed John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your commitment to this deal. To bridge the gap, I'm revising my offer to $1,550,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value and my initial offer. It represents a strong opportunity for both of us."",

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the end of negotiations. This counteroffer accomplishes two things:

* **Exceeds John's offer:**  It ensures we're aiming for a deal better than our fallback option.
* **Tests Bob's limit:** It encourages Bob to show his true willingness to pay while leaving room for a final concession if needed."
