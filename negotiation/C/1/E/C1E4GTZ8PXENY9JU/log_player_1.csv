Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and the significant benefits it offers, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this represents a fair price for both of us, considering its potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start the negotiation significantly higher. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, framing it around ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits""  might intrigue Bob and leave room for him to counter-offer.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Offering a price well above Bob's perceived value gives you space to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profit beyond your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  You don't know Bob's personality or how he negotiates.  He might be put off by a very high starting price. 
* **Relationship Building:**  If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important (for potential future deals), you might adjust your approach to be less aggressive."
