"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I appreciate your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,800,000 is a significant step away from where I see this product's potential. Could you consider $2,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
