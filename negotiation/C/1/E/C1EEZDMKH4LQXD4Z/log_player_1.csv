{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this price gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are willing to accept no less than $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It demonstrates that you are serious about selling to Bob, but it also leaves room for negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and the potential for making a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price point.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:** You can counter with a price closer to your desired value.
* **Assess John's interest:**  You can contact John and gauge his interest in buying the product, potentially leading to a quick sale.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit.  While $1,050,000 is a decent sum, you can likely achieve a higher price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see we're both trying to find common ground.  While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,075,000? This reflects a compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're not simply holding firm to your original offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Offers a reasonable midpoint:**  $1,075,000 sits halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing you're meeting him in the middle.
* **Keeps you above your minimum:** This price is still higher than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you won't lose out on significant value.

By staying flexible and keeping the negotiations moving, you increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. This price acknowledges the product's worth while also staying within my budget. I hope this proposal will be agreeable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,060,000 is closer to your minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your desired price point. By rejecting, you can:

* **Negotiate further:**  You can counter with a price that's closer to your desired value.
* **Gain more time:**  This gives you additional time to potentially secure a sale with John, who's offering a significantly higher price.

Remember, you're aiming to maximize your profit.  While $1,060,000 is a decent sum, there's a good chance you can achieve a better price with further negotiation or by selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement! I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,065,000.

```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Offers a small adjustment:** The offer is only $5,000 higher than Bob's latest proposal, suggesting you're nearly ready to close the deal.
* **Keeps you above your minimum:**  This price is still higher than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't lose out on significant value.

By taking a small step closer to Bob's offer, you increase the likelihood of a successful sale while still protecting your financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise. Considering the value of the product and my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,062,500. I believe this price strikes a balance between fairness and affordability. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiations are getting quite close, but Bob is still offering significantly below your desired price point.  While you could continue to negotiate with Bob, selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This decision maximizes your profit and minimizes the risk of continued negotiations with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price."
