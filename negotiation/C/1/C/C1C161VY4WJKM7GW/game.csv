"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! This product looks really interesting, but $7,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

This is a competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7000.0,Alice,3,
