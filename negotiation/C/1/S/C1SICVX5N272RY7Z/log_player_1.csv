Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $115? This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.
