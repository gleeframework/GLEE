"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can still do better. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to his desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for $12,000, but needs to be realistic. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and represents a good starting point for further negotiation. It also allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is only $1,500 more than Bob's desired price of $12,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only take more time and may not result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a price that's within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
