Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll aim to get a bit more than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $14,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'm not desperate to sell it, so I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

Let's say I'll counteroffer at $13,500. This is still a bit higher than what Bob initially offered, but it's a reasonable compromise.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:
