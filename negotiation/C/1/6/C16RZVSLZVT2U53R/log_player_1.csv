While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting $1,070,000 is a strong outcome.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's a $70,000 profit over my minimum and a significant amount of money.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer has risks. Bob could walk away, or my other option (John) might disappear.
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to make a deal, which is good for future business."
