"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product is valuable, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $925,000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
