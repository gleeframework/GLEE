Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? This would still allow you to get a great deal on the product, while also giving me a price that's fair for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.
