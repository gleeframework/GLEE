"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $950,000, which is very close to my ideal price. I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal. I've gotten a good price and don't want to risk losing out on the sale by continuing to negotiate."
