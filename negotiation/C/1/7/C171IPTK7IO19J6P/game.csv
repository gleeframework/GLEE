"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still represents a considerable discount from my initial asking price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  Let's try $950,000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
