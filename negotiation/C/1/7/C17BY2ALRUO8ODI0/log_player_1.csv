Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name].  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, using phrases like ""given its value"" subtly implies there are compelling reasons.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Indicating willingness to negotiate shows flexibility and can encourage Bob to engage in a dialogue rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Backup Option:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
