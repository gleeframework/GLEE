Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $10000? I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
