"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price of $100. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her value of $80.  This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high for my budget, but it's a step in the right direction. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. I still have several rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'm confident we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm serious about finding a deal, while still keeping my budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $89. Let's close this deal and you can start enjoying the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is within my budget and is getting close to my target price. At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product.  I've already spent several rounds negotiating and I risk losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
