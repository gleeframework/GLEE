Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While $850,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $875,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but only to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.  Let me know what you think.
