"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product, which I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is significantly lower than John's price ($1,500,000).** 
* Even though you might find a better deal elsewhere, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a substantial saving of $400,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Alice's offer in the hopes of finding a price closer to your $800,000 valuation carries a risk. You might end up having to buy from John at the higher price."
