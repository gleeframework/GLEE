Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also including a friendly message to make the interaction more positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That's a bit steep for me, would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me, as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate you showing interest. While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $75. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
``` 
I'm countering with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and acknowledging his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, thanks for countering Alice. I'm trying to keep my spending down on this, could we do $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $70 is still above my minimum of $80 and it seems like Bob is firm on that price. It's better to get a sale than risk further negotiation and potentially lose him as a buyer."
