```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. This is the best I can do for now.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a profit, and $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $13,000 is still outside of his budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further.  He can also factor in the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to me. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you $13,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  Bob has only 3 rounds left, and the negotiation seems to be getting stuck.  Given the risk of further negotiation delays and the certainty of getting the product from John for $8,000, Bob should choose to buy from John. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further potential delays or complications with Alice."
