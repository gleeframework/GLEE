Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You know John will buy the product for $150, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maximize Profit:** Your goal is to get as much as possible from Bob.  
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high offer of $170 gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Potential for Success:** While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he values it for other reasons (e.g., convenience, urgency). 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims high. Bob might reject this initial offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, you're not at risk of losing the sale entirely."
