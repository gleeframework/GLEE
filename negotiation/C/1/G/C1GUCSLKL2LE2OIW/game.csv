"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1200000.  Let's chat and see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1100000?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1100000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is just too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1025000?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $950000 to $1025000, which is $987500. Would you consider this price?",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close! $987500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down just a little further. How about $1000000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $985000. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",985000.0,Bob,8,
