"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still allows you a good profit margin, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,350,000, but it's still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,475,000. This would be a significant investment for you, and I'm sure it would be profitable.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1475000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my revised offer?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,425,000. This price still offers you a substantial gain, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
