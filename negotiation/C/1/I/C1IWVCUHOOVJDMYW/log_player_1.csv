{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation, considering Bob's perceived value of the product. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1,500,000 through negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe I can get closer to $1,200,000 or even higher.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my original offer of $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?  This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which is $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $1,050,000 is a decent offer considering Bob's counteroffers. It's above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and puts me closer to my target price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
