"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
