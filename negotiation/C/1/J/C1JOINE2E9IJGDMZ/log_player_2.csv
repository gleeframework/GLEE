"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you as you'd be making a profit, and it's the highest I can go at this time."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you and would allow me to make a decent profit.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still lower than her initial price of $1,400,000 and is within Bob's budget of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product and save $50,000 compared to buying from John. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject his offer again, and he may end up having to pay the full $1,200,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer provides a guaranteed savings for Bob."
