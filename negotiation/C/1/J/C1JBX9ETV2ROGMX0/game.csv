"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I understand the value you see in it, but I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we meet halfway at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's settle this now. How about $837,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",837500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",825000.0,Bob,6,
