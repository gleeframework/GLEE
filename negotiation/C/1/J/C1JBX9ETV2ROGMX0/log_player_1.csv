Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I understand the value you see in it, but I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we meet halfway at $850,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $825,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and willing to move on price. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has held firm at $825,000 for two rounds and explicitly stated it's his highest possible offer. While it's less than we hoped for, it's significantly more than John is offering. It's time to accept and close the deal.  Continuing to push risks losing the sale altogether."
