Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $140, it's not worth risking losing the sale and having to sell to John for $120. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a profit and avoid any further negotiation."
