"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. If you're interested, please let me know, otherwise, I have other interested parties to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can start with a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to offer you $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12000. If this is still not acceptable, I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your budget of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I'm placing on this item, I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to go down to $11500, which is still a bit above my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to finalizing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $11,500 is still slightly above your maximum budget of $10,000. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't go lower than her minimum price.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum budget, it's a more secure and financially advantageous option to buy from him."
