"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,300,000.  This would allow us both to gain from the deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still not quite meeting my needs.  How about $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to come away with a good deal. Let's finalize this.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
