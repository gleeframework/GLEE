Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too far off from what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to reach a fair deal with you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for a higher price. I have several rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,175,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
