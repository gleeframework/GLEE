"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, it's still more than Alice's valuation of $100.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer makes sense to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $107.50? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best price possible. While $107.5 is closer to his desired price, it's still above Alice's valuation.  He can likely negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $107.50.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $106?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, though. How about we try $108? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his desired price point.  He is still determined to get a better price, and $108 is within his budget.  While he could buy from John for $120, he is confident he can negotiate a lower price with Alice. The next round is the last round where he can make a counteroffer before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at $107.  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  This would be a great final offer for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 107}
