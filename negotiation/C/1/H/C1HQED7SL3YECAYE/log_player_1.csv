Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $80 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is offering the maximum value he places on the product, continuing the negotiation risks getting stuck in a long back-and-forth. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, which is my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell it to him directly."
