{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, allowing for potential negotiation while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to pay $9,000? This would allow both of us to come to a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,000 is a fair price. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum price, and I've already been through a round of counteroffers.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price, so that's the best course of action."
