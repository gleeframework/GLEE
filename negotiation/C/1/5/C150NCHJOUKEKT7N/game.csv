"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $150.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While it's a great product, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $150.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $130? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $150.",145.0,Alice,5,
