"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as much as possible.  This price is significantly higher than the product's worth to both of us, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about negotiating but still want to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more by continuing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a lower price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm offering $1,250,000.  This is getting very close to my bottom line, but I'm still hoping to squeeze a little more out of the deal.  I'm confident that Bob understands the value of the product and is willing to pay a fair price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more by continuing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a lower price yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

I'm offering $1,225,000.  This is a very small concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to persuade Bob.  I'm running out of time, but I'm still determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  I've reached a point where I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob.  I've already made several concessions, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John ensures that I get a fair price for the product, and I can move on to other business opportunities."
