"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to both Bob and Alice, there's no incentive for Bob to accept the offer in the first round. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $10,000 is a significant discount and a good starting point for negotiations. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from $10,000 to $11,000, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. This could be a good compromise point, but if Alice rejects it again, Bob will need to reassess his strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal of saving money. While $11,200 is still more than his initial counteroffer, it's significantly less than Alice's initial price and only $200 more than his last counteroffer.  With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on a potential deal altogether."
