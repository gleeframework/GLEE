Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, we've decided to adjust our position slightly. We are now willing to consider $875,000 as a fair price for the product. We hope this aligns more closely with your valuation and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's counteroffer is $875,000, which is still a better deal for you than buying from John for $1,000,000.  You can save $125,000 by accepting this offer.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John is not worth the potential savings."
