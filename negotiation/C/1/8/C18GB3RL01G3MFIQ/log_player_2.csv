"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than what John is offering. While it's a somewhat competitive offer, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer  ($1,050,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This counter-offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Time Consideration:** We have time for several rounds of negotiation, so starting lower allows us to potentially reach a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met our alternative price.  There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further if we're ultimately willing to buy at this price anyway."
