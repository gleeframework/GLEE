"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with her."

Alice's offer:

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is still above his budget and he has a guaranteed option to get the product for $10,000 from John.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get him a price he's willing to pay."
