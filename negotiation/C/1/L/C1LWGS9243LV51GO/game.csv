"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still not a viable price for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal. I'm confident this price will be beneficial for your business in the long run. Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm thinking of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
