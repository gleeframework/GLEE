Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The message doesn't sound like an ultimatum, allowing Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal above $1,000,000."
