"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for you to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement.  How about we settle right in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $762,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.  I'm confident this is the best deal we can make. What do you think?",762500.0,Alice,7,
