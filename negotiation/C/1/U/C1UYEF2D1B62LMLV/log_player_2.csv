"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. As you know, I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my price, but I need you to meet me at $800,000. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice is now firmly anchoring the price to her own value of the product and bringing in another buyer adds pressure. While continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, it's risky. Accepting at $800,000 guarantees Bob gets the product for significantly less than his maximum and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
