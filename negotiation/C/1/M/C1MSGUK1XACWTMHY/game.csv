"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth to you and the market value, I propose we set the price at $100. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring you get a fair deal while also compensating for the value the product holds for you personally. Let me know if this works for you!",100.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Given its worth to me, I'm willing to pay $85. This would give you a good profit margin, while still allowing me to afford the purchase. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
