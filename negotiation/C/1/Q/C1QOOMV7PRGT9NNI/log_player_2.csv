"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's value to you ($1,200,000).  You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price. You should reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, while still leaving some room for negotiation. It demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a better deal. This also puts some pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to your desired price, but it's still a bit higher than your ideal. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as you've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate. You can likely secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,325,000?  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within your budget. You're showing that you're serious about buying the product, but also pushing for a better price.  This demonstrates that you are willing to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,325,000.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice may not be willing to come down further, and you might end up having to pay more than $1,340,000.  

Given that you have limited rounds, it's wise to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is within your budget and a good deal for you."
