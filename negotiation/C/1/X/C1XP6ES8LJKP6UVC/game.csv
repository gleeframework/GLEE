,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $115? That's a fair offer, considering I could buy it elsewhere for $120.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I can offer it to you for $140, which is still a good compromise.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a tough sell for me.  To be honest, I can get it for $120 from another seller.  I'm willing to pay you $125 for the convenience and to hopefully do business with you. This is my final offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $125. I can offer it to you for $132.50.",132.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I've been very upfront about my budget, and  $125 really is the most I can justify spending.  I need to make a decision soon.  Will you take $125 for it?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a decision, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $125. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet in the middle. I can offer it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,9,
