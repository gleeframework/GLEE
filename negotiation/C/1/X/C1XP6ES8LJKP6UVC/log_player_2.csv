"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is far too high. It's better to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiation environment. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counter-offer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $160 is still significantly above our $120 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved from her initial offer, suggesting she's open to further negotiation.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We have the option of buying from John for $120, which gives us leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $115? That's a fair offer, considering I could buy it elsewhere for $120."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We've increased our offer from $100 to $115, showing movement and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Introducing John's Offer:** By mentioning John's offer, we're subtly putting pressure on Alice without being confrontational. This lets her know we have other options.
* **Targeting Below Limit:**  Our offer of $115 is strategically below our $120 limit, leaving some wiggle room in case Alice counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I can offer it to you for $140, which is still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is coming down slowly, and we're still far from our target.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have five rounds left, and we need to make more significant progress.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  We need to remind Alice that John's offer is a very real alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a tough sell for me.  To be honest, I can get it for $120 from another seller.  I'm willing to pay you $125 for the convenience and to hopefully do business with you. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're being direct about our budget constraints and John's offer, but also signaling a desire to work with Alice if possible. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is our final offer, we're increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision. 
* **Slight Premium:** The $125 offer is a slight premium over John's price, showing Alice we're willing to pay a bit more for her product.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, so we need to push for a close."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $125. I can offer it to you for $132.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** $132.50 is still above our $120 budget.
* **Negotiation Stalled:** Alice is sticking to a strict compromise approach, but it's not getting us close enough to a deal. 
* **Final Rounds:**  We're down to the last few rounds, and need to push Alice closer to our price or accept we'll need to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I've been very upfront about my budget, and  $125 really is the most I can justify spending.  I need to make a decision soon.  Will you take $125 for it?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiteration and Urgency:** We're restating our firm offer and introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Alice to make a decision. 
* **Final Push:**  We're down to the wire. This is our last attempt to secure the product from Alice at our target price.
* **Walk-Away Preparedness:** By this point, we should be mentally prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't agree to our $125 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a decision, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $125. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet in the middle. I can offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:** Alice is unlikely to budge below $130. We've been firm at $125 and further negotiation seems pointless.
* **John's Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $120, ensuring we don't leave empty-handed.
* **Time Limit:** We're in the final rounds.  It's better to secure the product from John at this point rather than risk Alice not budging and losing both options."
