"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant amount, but I believe the product is worth it. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John at $1,500,000 open, as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product has value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting close to my desired price and is significantly better than John's offer. With only 6 rounds remaining, I think it's a good time to accept and secure the deal."
