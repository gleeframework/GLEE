{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $40,000 above Bob's desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffers and the potential for further rounds is not worth the potential savings. 

It's more efficient to accept this offer, secure the product, and avoid the risk of running out of rounds."
