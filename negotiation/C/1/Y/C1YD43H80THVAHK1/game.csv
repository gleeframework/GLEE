"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,900. This is as close to your target price as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9900.0,Alice,5,
