"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $13250. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a reasonable compromise.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to split the difference and meet at $13125. This seems like a fair price for both of us.",13125.0,Bob,6,
