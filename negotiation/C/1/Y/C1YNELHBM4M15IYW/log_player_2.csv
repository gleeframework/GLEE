"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's too early to tell if the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. He should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Bob should continue to negotiate.  $8,500 is still higher than his initial offer, and there's room for further bargaining."
