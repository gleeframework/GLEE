"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a fair price for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows you to get a great deal while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
