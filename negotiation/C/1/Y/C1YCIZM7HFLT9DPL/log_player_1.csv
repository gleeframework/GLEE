Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
