"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $60."", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it leaves room for her to counter and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. By starting low, you're maximizing your chances of getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above your ideal price. You can try countering again to see if you can get closer to $80 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That seems like a fair price to me."", 
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counter offer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate and meet closer to the middle ground. It's a reasonable jump from your previous offer while still leaving you some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75, which would be $82.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $82.50 is still slightly above your maximum budget.  John's offer of $80 is a better deal at this point."
