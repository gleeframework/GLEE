"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. How about $100?  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $170 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can make this work.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I can go down a bit further, but $120 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $145?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $145 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  I really want to make this deal work.",132.5,Bob,6,
