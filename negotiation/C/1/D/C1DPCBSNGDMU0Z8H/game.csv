"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price to make this worthwhile. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product offers you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be open to that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $1,175,000? This offer is fair and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close! I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference at $1,162,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions.  Let's get this deal done.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
