# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $800,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?
