Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** This aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer without feeling pressured. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Counteroffers:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll analyze his offer and determine whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **Selling to John:** If the negotiations with Bob stall or fail, I'll  switch to John and finalize the sale for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $800,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a substantial profit margin.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob, highlighting that $800,000 is still a great deal for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussion by asking for his opinion.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response, considering his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Adjusting my strategy:** Based on Bob's response, I'll either accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or proceed with selling to John."
