``` 

This offer starts high, but is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. It leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully, Bob will accept. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if his counteroffer is worth considering, or if I should just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

While I am open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
