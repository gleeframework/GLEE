"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Let's call it $9,000. That's a fair price that's a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,5,
