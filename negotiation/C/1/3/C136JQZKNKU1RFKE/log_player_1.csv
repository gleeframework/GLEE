**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we're still significantly below our minimum and John's offer.  It's time to apply more pressure and signal we have other options."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but to be honest, we're still quite far apart. I have other interested parties, and to be fair to them, my absolute lowest price for this product is $900,000.  This is a final offer, take it or leave it."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strong Stance:** By presenting a ""final offer,"" we're creating a sense of urgency and showing Bob we're serious about the value we place on the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly reminds Bob that we have options and might walk away if he doesn't meet our demands.
* **Slight Concession:** Dropping to $900,000 is a small concession to show some flexibility, but it keeps us above Bob's highest offer and our guaranteed sale price with John. 

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a decision while still maintaining a strong position."
