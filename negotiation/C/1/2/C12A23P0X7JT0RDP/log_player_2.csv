"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I have room to negotiate down towards my $15,000 maximum, but it's unlikely Alice would accept an offer that low immediately.  It's better to counter-offer and see how much she's willing to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down $2,000, which is good progress. I'm still willing to negotiate further.  There's a decent chance I could get the price closer to $11,000 if I hold out a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,000.  Would you consider that?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
