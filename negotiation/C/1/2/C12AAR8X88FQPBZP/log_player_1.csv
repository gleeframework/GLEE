Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in this product but that's my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing negotiations.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm still hopeful I can secure a price closer to my desired $125. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this deal! I'm willing to come down a bit more to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again at $112.50. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer $115, Bob's offer of $112.50 is a fair compromise.  It's a significant improvement over his previous offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a good price for me and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for $100."
