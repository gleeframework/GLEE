,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in this product but that's my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal! I'm willing to come down a bit more to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",115.0,Alice,5,
