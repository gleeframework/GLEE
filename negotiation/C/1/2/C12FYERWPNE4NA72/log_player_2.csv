"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). This gives us some room to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and a good price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're still aiming for a better deal. We have enough rounds left to negotiate further without risking running out of time and being forced to buy from John at the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to move up a bit, how about $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are nudging our offer slightly upward to show Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're still holding firm below $9,000. This keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is definitely getting closer, and $9,000 is tempting. However, we're aiming to stay below $9,000 if possible. We'll push a bit further, but we need to be mindful of the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it: $8,800.  Let me know if we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 8800
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the point where we might have to settle for a price around $9,000.  This offer is a strong signal that we are very close to our maximum budget but want to give Alice one more chance to meet us closer to our target price. The ""final offer"" language adds pressure while keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $8,900. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met us almost in the middle. While we could push further, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better price without risking the deal altogether. Accepting at $8,900 secures a good discount compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
