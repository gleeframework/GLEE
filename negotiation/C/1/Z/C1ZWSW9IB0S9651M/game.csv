"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
