How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's very close to the middle ground. How about $1,025,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and at this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs."
