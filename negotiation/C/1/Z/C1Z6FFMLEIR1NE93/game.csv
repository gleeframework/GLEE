"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product. However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $5,000?  I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider selling the product to you for $6,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $5,500 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $6,200. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",6200.0,Alice,5,
