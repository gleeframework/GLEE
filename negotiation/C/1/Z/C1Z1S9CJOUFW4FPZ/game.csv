"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well.",825000.0,Alice,5,
