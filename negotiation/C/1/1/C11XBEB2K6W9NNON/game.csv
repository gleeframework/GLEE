"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's valuable, $22,000 is quite high for me. I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $18,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Could you consider $12,000? That feels like a fair offer to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $12,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $14,000 as a final offer. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
