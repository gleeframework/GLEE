Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product for and what it's worth to him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and move closer to a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what it can do for your business. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,080,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1080000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,080,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $990,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, I'm still better off aiming a bit higher. Selling to John is a tempting backup, but I think I can still get a better deal from Bob with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1040000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  While I see the value in the product, I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,010,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now offering a price that exceeds my minimum and provides a significant profit. While I could push for a bit more, there's always a risk that Bob walks away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good outcome."
