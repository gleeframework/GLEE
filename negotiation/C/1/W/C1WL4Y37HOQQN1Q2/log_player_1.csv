I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer of $11,000.  It's still a good profit for me, and I hope it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer is my best option to maximize my profits."
