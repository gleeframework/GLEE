"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000.  This gives you a significant advantage, and allows me to achieve a price well above my minimum.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
