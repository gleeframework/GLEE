Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

I'm still aiming to get closer to my bottom line. While Bob is moving in the right direction, I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the product's value.  To be candid, I need to make sure this is a profitable deal. Would you consider $1,037,500? This is a small adjustment, but reflects the fair value I'm aiming for."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, Alice, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,015,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting at $1,015,000 secures a significant profit compared to John's offer, and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
