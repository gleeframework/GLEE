"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that I think is fair and represents its true worth.  Let's talk about [product description, highlighting potential value to Bob] and I'm confident you'll see the potential.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is vague and doesn't provide any information about the product's value. It's likely she's trying to convince Bob to accept the offer without giving him enough information to make an informed decision.  Since Bob has a backup option to buy the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and gather more information before committing."
