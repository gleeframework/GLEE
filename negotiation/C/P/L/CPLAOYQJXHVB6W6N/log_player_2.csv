Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. Considering the true value of this product, I can meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1,350,000. This reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the significant benefits this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is still within your budget of $1,500,000 and a good deal compared to buying from John.  There's always the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting an even lower price, but it's also possible that Alice will not budge further, or you could end up spending more time and potentially lose out on the deal entirely."
