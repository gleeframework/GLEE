{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to pay a bit more to get it.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are willing to sell for at least $150, so you have room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $125 is a reasonable price for a product worth $150, and it leaves room for both you and Bob to negotiate. 

By starting with this offer, you can see if Bob is interested in buying the product. If he is not, you can then explore counteroffers or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum value of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate with Bob a bit more.  

You can try a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below your minimum, to see if you can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  You're increasing the price, showing that you are willing to negotiate, but not at a price that significantly undervalues your product.
* **Lower than your minimum:** It's still below your minimum price of $150, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Reasonably compromises:** You are essentially meeting Bob halfway between your previous offer and his offer, showing good faith and a willingness to find a solution.

This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation while ensuring you are still getting a reasonable price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to go elsewhere, but I have to make a smart financial decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is showing interest in the product, his offers are still significantly lower than your minimum value. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150.  Since Bob's offers are not getting closer to your minimum, it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  

You will earn more by selling to John."
