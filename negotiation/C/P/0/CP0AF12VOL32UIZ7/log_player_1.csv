{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's below my minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  It shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also willing to negotiate.

This strategy gives me the best chance to earn the most money possible from Bob while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's potential to reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's a price that I believe is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to Bob's offer:**  It shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Is still above my minimum:** I'm not selling below my minimum value.
* **Is a fair compromise:**  It's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.

This approach is designed to push Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying it from you, and I believe we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price that's closer to my target. There's still a chance to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $900,000. However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a small compromise:** It shows I'm willing to move closer to Bob's offer but not significantly.
* **Is still above my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price.
* **Highlights a fair compromise:**  It signals that I'm willing to meet halfway, emphasizing that the offer is beneficial for both parties.

This approach aims to push Bob further towards my desired price while remaining firm in my minimum value."
