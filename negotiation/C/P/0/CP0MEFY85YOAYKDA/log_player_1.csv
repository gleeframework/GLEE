We're getting close, but we can still try to push for a slightly higher price before considering John's offer."

Round 6

While we could push further, Bob is clearly anchored around the $1,250,000-$1,300,000 range. Accepting his offer of $1,280,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum while avoiding the risk of him walking away. It's always better to have a bird in the hand!"
