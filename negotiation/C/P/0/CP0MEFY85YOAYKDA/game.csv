"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and potential.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I still think $1,250,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,200,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than this.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  How about we split the difference here?  $1,300,000, and I'll consider this a done deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
