"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $9,000. Even though Alice claims it's a competitive price, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice will lower her price to get the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $8500? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $10,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will refuse and he'll have to buy from John.  It's likely that Alice is at her lowest price, so accepting the offer is the best option."
