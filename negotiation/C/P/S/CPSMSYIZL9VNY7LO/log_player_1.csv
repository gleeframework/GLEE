""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? "", 
""product_price"": 10250
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $10,250. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Reasoning: While I could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $9,750. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $1,750 over my minimum selling price to John."
