"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its high value to you, I propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This price reflects the balance between its worth to you and the cost to me. I am confident this offer presents a fair opportunity for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to adjust my offer to $9,500. This price reflects a compromise that considers both the product's value to you and the cost to me. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still higher than the product's worth to her, but it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.  Bob can save a considerable amount by accepting Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
