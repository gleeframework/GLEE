Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to capitalize on his potential interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for potential negotiation without immediately hitting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob, making it seem like a good deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed accordingly, potentially making a counteroffer of my own.
* I'll keep the option of selling to John at $15,000 in mind if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **There's still potential for negotiation.**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest, which suggests a possibility of finding a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is a safe option but not necessarily the best.**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I might be able to get closer to that amount through further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to find a price point that's still attractive to Bob but also profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** My counter-offer aims to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob to make it more appealing.
* **Flexibility:** I've come down from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing for potential further negotiation without compromising my profit.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you meet me at $11,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While he has demonstrated some willingness to negotiate, his last offer is still significantly lower than what I need. 
* **Further negotiation may be unproductive.**  I've already made concessions, and Bob has stated his maximum price point.  Continuing the negotiation could lead to an extended process without a guarantee of a profitable outcome.
* **Selling to John guarantees a safe and profitable outcome.** This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids further potential negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale of the product at $15,000."
