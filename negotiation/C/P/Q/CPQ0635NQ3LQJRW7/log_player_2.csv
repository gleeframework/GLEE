"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice is starting high. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's initial price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a good negotiating relationship. 
* **Strategic:** By offering $8,000, I'm aiming to get Alice to counter with a price closer to my target of $10,000 or lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This still represents a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our target price! There's no point in risking further negotiation or going to John, as we've achieved the best possible outcome."
