I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering it's worth $1,500,000 to him and still leaves me a good profit margin.  I'm confident he'll find this offer attractive."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensures I get a decent profit."

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum price. While I'd like to get more, I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
