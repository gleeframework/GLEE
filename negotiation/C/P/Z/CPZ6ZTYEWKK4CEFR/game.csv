"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
