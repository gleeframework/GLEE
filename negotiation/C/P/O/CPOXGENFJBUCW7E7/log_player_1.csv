Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob:**  I don't know Bob's value for the product.  This high starting price allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory.

**Next Steps:** 

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer, if any. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I might use John as a bargaining chip to push Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to push for a higher price, especially since I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to continue negotiating. This can put pressure on Bob to increase his offer. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price that's more favorable to me while still keeping the deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not giving in completely to Bob's price, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  This counteroffer is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, giving me leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my price.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a favorable price. If he rejects, I will need to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has stubbornly stuck with his offer of $1,200,000, and I've already made a concession to reach the middle ground. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale. It's lower than my ideal price, but it ensures that I'll receive a minimum of $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Prolonging negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him walking away entirely, leaving me with nothing.  Selling to John guarantees a sale and avoids potential loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000."
