Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll try to get a good price for it. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 7,500}

This is a reasonable starting point, as it's still below the product's value to Bob, but not too low. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'm not willing to sell it to him for $7,200, which is $800 less than its value. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer will be:

{""product_price"": 7,800}

This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, trying to get closer to the product's true value. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob rejected my previous offer, and now I'll make a new counteroffer. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll try to get closer to that price. Here's my next offer:

{""product_price"": 7,900}

This is a slight increase from my previous offer, trying to get closer to the product's value. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
