{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit lower than $90. How about $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's last offer was at my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the sale than risk getting nothing if we continue negotiating."
