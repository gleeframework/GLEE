"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1750000. I'm thinking more in the range of $900000. Can you meet me there?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset.  Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
