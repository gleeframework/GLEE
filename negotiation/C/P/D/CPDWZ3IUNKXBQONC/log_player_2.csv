Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $8,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

While Alice met me halfway, I can get the product for $500 less from John. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it makes more sense to take the sure thing."
