{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $990,000.  This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, my goal is to maximize my earnings. Offering the product to Bob first allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm setting the price at $990,000, which is significantly below my minimum but still a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By calling it a ""one-time offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly and not risk missing out.

This offer balances my desire for maximum profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
