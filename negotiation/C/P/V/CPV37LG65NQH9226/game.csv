"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1000000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $980000. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not quite there with $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $990000. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $990000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we try $965000?",965000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up by $5000 to $970000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",970000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $970000, but I'd like to propose one final counteroffer. I'll meet you at $975000, but only if you're willing to throw in a small concession on the contract terms. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I'm not willing to make any concessions on the contract terms. I'm willing to meet you at $970000, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",970000.0,Bob,10,
