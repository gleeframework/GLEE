{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round. While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I'm still unable to reach my desired price of at least $1,500,000.  With no further negotiating room, it's time to execute my backup plan.

* **Sell to John:** John is a guaranteed buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price.  By selling to him, I ensure that I don't settle for less than what I believe the product is worth. 

Even though I've had a good negotiation with Bob, the decision to sell to John makes the most financial sense in this final round."
