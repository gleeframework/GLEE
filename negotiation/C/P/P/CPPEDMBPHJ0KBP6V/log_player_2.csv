"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He should keep trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be cautious, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, so I'm thinking of $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal.  He should counter with a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of $12,500. It's still a good price considering the value of the product, and it's a bit closer to what I was originally asking. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is not budging much and $12,500 is still outside Bob's preferred budget.  It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and save some money."
