"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be cautious, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, so I'm thinking of $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm thinking of $12,500. It's still a good price considering the value of the product, and it's a bit closer to what I was originally asking. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,7,
