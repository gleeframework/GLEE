Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your product is of interest to me,  $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
