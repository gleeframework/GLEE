"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $8,000. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,900.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen!",8900.0,Alice,5,
