Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him if he buys from you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John, and you don't know how high he's willing to go. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a safety net with John, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting closer to Bob's valuation, showing him you understand the product's worth.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Profitable for You:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still making significantly more than your fallback offer from John.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate strategically to reach an agreement that benefits both of you."
