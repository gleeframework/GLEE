**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum. I've already compromised significantly, and continuing the negotiation risks leaving money on the table. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount and ensures I don't lose potential profit by continuing a drawn-out negotiation with Bob."
