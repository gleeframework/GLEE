"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750? This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
