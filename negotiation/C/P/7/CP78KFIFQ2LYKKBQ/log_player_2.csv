"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there is room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $9,500, there's still room for negotiation before he has to resort to buying from John.  Rejecting allows Bob to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will work for you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been trying to get the price down as much as possible. At this point,  Alice has come down to $8,875, which is within Bob's budget and only $375 more than what he wanted to pay.  Accepting the offer saves Bob time and ensures he gets the product without having to buy from John."
