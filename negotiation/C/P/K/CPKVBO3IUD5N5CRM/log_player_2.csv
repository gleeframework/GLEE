"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob is looking for a product worth no more than $12,000, and Alice's offer is exactly $12,000, there's potential for negotiation to save money. It's a good idea to see if Alice is willing to drop the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price is within Bob's budget:** $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob already offered $10,000 and Alice countered with $11,500, so there's not much room for further price drops. 
* **Risk of losing the product:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice will become less flexible or even back out of the deal.  Also, buying from John at $12,000 is no better than this offer.

It's a good deal for Bob, and it's likely better to secure the product at this price than to risk losing it or paying more."
