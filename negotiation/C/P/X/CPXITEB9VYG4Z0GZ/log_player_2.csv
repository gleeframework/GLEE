"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a very competitive price. Are you interested in discussing the details? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is only slightly below your maximum budget and significantly higher than what it's worth to her ($800,000). By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. While you might have to buy from John for $1,000,000, there's a chance Alice will come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale altogether."
