# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! It's something you'll definitely appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

While $125 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You should reject this offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
