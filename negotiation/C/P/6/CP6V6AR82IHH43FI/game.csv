"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $600,000?  That seems fair given the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you given the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $725,000?  That shows I'm serious about buying, and it's still a good price for you.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $725,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for something closer to $800,000. Let's meet halfway and settle on $762,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",762500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your compromise.  How about $740,000? That's me meeting you more than halfway on your last offer.",740000.0,Bob,6,
