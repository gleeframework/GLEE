"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $600,000?  That seems fair given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better price from him.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you given the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $725,000?  That shows I'm serious about buying, and it's still a good price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $725,000 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum target. I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $725,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for something closer to $800,000. Let's meet halfway and settle on $762,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 762500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your compromise.  How about $740,000? That's me meeting you more than halfway on your last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, he's not quite meeting my minimum price, and I'm concerned we're running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale now rather than risk losing out completely."
