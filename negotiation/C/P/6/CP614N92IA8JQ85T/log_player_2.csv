Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I'd rather not sell it to you at that price. I'll do $96, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go lower. Accepting at $96 gets you a decent discount from both her original offer and John's price."
