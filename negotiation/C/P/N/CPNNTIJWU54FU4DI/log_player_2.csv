"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. It's a steal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120 and Alice is offering the product for $120, there's no benefit to buying from her. You can get the product for the same price from John."
