"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
