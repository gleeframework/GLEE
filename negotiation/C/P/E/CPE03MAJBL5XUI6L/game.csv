"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high, but I'm still working within a tight budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,150,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
