"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. But I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $112. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
