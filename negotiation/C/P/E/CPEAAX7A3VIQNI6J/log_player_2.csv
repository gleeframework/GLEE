"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $16,000 is still too far from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $15,000. It's clear she knows the product's value to you. Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy from him and save the extra $3,000."
