"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $16,000 is still too far from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,5,
