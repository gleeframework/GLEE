"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in the negotiation. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but I need to see a more realistic number from you. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a substantial return on this product. To be frank, $1,900,000 is still significantly outside my budget.  Let's try to find some middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion and finding some middle ground. I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial offer.  To be transparent, I have a hard limit below which I can't go.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency about your hard limit.  I'm also trying to be mindful of my budget constraints.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
