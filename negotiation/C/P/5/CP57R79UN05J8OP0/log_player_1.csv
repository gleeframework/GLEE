"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the product's ""potential"" provides a reason for the high price without revealing specific details. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's perspective, indicating your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. Accepting would be a substantial loss. While his offer is far from ideal, there's still room for negotiation in the remaining rounds. You know John offers a safety net at $1,500,000, but it's too early to settle for that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in the negotiation. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but I need to see a more realistic number from you. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000?"" ,
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge but Stand Firm:**  You recognize Bob's counteroffer but clearly state that it's unacceptable.  
* **Highlight Value (Again):** You reiterate the product's ""true potential,"" subtly reinforcing the idea that Bob might be undervaluing it.
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** You make a substantial drop from $2,250,000 to $1,900,000. This signals flexibility but keeps you well above both your minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Gauge Willingness:** Asking ""Would you be willing..."" encourages Bob to engage and potentially reveal his negotiating range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a substantial return on this product. To be frank, $1,900,000 is still significantly outside my budget.  Let's try to find some middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000, which is a positive sign. However, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have some room to negotiate, and you're getting a sense of Bob's possible price range. It's too early to accept his offer or sell to John. You'll continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion and finding some middle ground. I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial offer.  To be transparent, I have a hard limit below which I can't go.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** You start by acknowledging Bob's efforts to find common ground. This maintains a positive atmosphere and encourages him to keep negotiating.
* **Introduce a ""Hard Limit"":**  Without revealing your actual minimum, you introduce the concept of a  limit. This adds a sense of urgency and makes your position seem stronger.
* **Strong but (Relatively) Fair Counter:** You move closer to Bob's offer with $1,600,000, which is still above your $1,500,000 minimum. This signals a willingness to make a deal but not at any cost.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** Describing it as a ""fair compromise"" positions the offer as beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency about your hard limit.  I'm also trying to be mindful of my budget constraints.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below your absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  While he's getting closer, there's no guarantee he'll meet your price in the remaining rounds. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed offer to ensure you get a fair price for the product.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching your minimum, leaving you with a less favorable outcome."
