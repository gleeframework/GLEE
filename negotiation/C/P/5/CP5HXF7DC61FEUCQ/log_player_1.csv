"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the product's value to me, and I have more rounds to try and get a better price.  I'm willing to risk losing Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit and reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not where I want to be.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little further.  I still have a few rounds left to negotiate and John is always a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to meet you at $12,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
