"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit and reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to meet you at $12000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
