"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,350,000.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, offering $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $1,350,000, but it's still within your budget. It's a compromise that shows you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but it's still above your maximum price.  You're better off buying from John at $1,200,000, which guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
