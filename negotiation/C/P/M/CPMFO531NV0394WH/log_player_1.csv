"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point that gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is far too low for me. It's well below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for Bob while also ensuring I don't sell it for too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering the price to $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will entice him to accept. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John at the $100 price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm running out of time. It's better to guarantee the $100 from John than risk getting a worse offer from Bob."
