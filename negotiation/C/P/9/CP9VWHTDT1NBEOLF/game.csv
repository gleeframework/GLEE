"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to get a reasonable value for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your interest in acquiring it. Let's finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
