"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,400,000 is still too high for Bob. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to get a reasonable value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's room for further negotiation before he needs to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your interest in acquiring it. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $1,275,000, the price is within his budget and is a better deal than buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his offer again and he could end up losing the deal.  It's better to secure a good price now than to risk a worse outcome."
