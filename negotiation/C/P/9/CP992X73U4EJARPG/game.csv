"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is closer, but still a little high for me.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
