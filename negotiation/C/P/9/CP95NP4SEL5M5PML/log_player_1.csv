"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, I have 10 rounds to negotiate. I want to see if I can push for a higher price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, I'm prepared to compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so I'll offer $1400000 again. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I still feel I can squeeze out a higher price. I've already shown a willingness to compromise, and with multiple rounds left, I want to see if I can push for a final price closer to $1,600,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit away from that price point.  To demonstrate my commitment to finalizing this deal, I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still not willing to drop below $1,400,000. While I have less bargaining power as we enter the later rounds, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or, in the worst case, sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 8th round, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers. The price has dropped below my initial minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could counteroffer again, there's a high chance Bob will continue to push for a lower price in the next rounds.  

It's wiser to sell to John at $1,200,000 and secure a guaranteed sale. This minimizes the risk of ending up with a price lower than my minimum."
