Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is slightly above your latest offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're close enough:** Alice is holding firm at $1,050,000.  While we might squeeze out a few more thousand, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away.
* **Time is a factor:**  We've used up 7 rounds. If the negotiations stall further, we might be forced to go with John at the full $1,200,000.
* **Good deal:** $1,050,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer. 

Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
