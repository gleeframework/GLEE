"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1650000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1650000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my maximum.  If you're serious about selling, let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
