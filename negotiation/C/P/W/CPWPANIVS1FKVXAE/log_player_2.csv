{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to the price John is offering."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Alice is coming down, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to make one last offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this. If you're not able to accept this price, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $1,050,000. I've already made concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get me a significantly better price. John is offering the product at my maximum limit, and it's time to secure the purchase before Alice changes her mind or finds another buyer."
