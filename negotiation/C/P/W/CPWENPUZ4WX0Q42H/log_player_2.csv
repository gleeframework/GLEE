Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $11,000? It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice seems unlikely to budge significantly from her $11,000 offer. While she might come down a small amount in future rounds, it's not worth the risk of her not going low enough. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $10,000 from John, which meets your needs and saves you money."
