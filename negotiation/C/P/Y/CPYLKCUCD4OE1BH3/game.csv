"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",10250.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still too far off from my ideal price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,900 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $10,050. This is a final offer from me. If it doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",10050.0,Alice,7,
