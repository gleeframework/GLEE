"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $775,000 is still below my bottom line. How about we split the difference - I'll come down to $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
