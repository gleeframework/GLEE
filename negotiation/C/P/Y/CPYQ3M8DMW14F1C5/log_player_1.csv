"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher profit for me.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm starting with a friendly and open message to encourage a positive interaction.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify my asking price. 

This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation that is both profitable and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I have 8 rounds left, which provides ample opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $800,000, I believe there's a chance to secure a higher price with Bob through further negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of a more profitable outcome while still having the safety net of selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also making a counter-offer to show I'm open to negotiation.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $850,000 to $825,000, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer (meeting in the middle) to make it seem more logical and fair.

This approach aims to:

* Maintain my position while showing willingness to compromise
* Keep the negotiation moving forward
* Increase the chances of a successful deal with Bob before resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** With 6 rounds left, I have sufficient time to continue negotiations and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John is a fallback:** Selling to John for $800,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail, but I'm not ready to give up on a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of achieving a more profitable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $775,000 is still below my bottom line. How about we split the difference - I'll come down to $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final compromise, as $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Split the Difference:** I'm suggesting a middle ground to demonstrate my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the potential for closing the deal to incentivize Bob to accept.

By offering this final counter-offer, I'm aiming to:

* Close the deal at my minimum acceptable price.
* Avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal to Bob.
* Secure a good outcome without resorting to selling to John."
