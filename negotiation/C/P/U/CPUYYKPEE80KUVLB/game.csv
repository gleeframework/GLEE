"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000 one last time. This is a final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to go down to $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,8,
