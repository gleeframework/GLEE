"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $180. This is still a good price for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. While I'm running out of time, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $160. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will entice Bob to make a more reasonable offer.  I'm nearing my minimum price, so I need to be careful with my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. With only four rounds left, it's unlikely that we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to Bob at such a low price."
