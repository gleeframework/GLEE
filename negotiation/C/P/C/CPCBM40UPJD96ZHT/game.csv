"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get at least $75 for this.",75.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about $70? That's a good compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $72.50, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on.",72.5,Alice,5,
