Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to sell it for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and positive.**  I want to build rapport with Bob to increase the chances of a successful deal. 
* **I express confidence in finding a price that works for both of us.** This helps to avoid an adversarial tone. 
* **I explicitly mention the value to Bob.**  This is a subtle way to remind him of the potential benefit he'll receive."
