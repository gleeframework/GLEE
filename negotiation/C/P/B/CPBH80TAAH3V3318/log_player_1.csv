Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit lower.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
