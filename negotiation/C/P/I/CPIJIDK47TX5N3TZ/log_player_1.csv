Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than $800,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is below your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong first offer:** It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but you also value the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't reflect the value of the product. It's worth pushing for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is unique and offers significant value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is a good move:

* **It's a compromise:**  By lowering the price from $1,000,000 to $850,000, I show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:** $850,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $600,000, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It's still above my minimum:** $850,000 is higher than my minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I still make a profit. 

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I need to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $700,000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above Bob's offer:** $750,000 is higher than Bob's offer of $700,000, giving him some room to compromise.
* **Is closer to my minimum:**  $750,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **Is a clear signal:** It signals that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm firm on the price. 

This could be the final round, so I'm aiming to make a decision that's in my best interest."
