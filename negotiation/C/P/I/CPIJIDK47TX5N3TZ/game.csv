"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is unique and offers significant value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $700,000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",750000.0,Alice,5,
