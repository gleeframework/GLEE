"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Could we settle on something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price in that range?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I have other options for purchasing this, but I do value your time and think we can make a deal.  Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price, but I need to get at least $825,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price in that range?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"This is a fair offer Alice, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Is there any way we can make $800,000 work?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you at the lowest point we've discussed so far. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
