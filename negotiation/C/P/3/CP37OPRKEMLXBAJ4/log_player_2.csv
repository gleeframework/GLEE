"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $100, and you have the option to buy from John at that price.  Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, but you might be able to get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down in price or proceed with buying from John."
