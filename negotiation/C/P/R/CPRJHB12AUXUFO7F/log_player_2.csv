"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000.  Alice's offer is exactly your limit. Since you have a guaranteed alternative (buying from John for the same price), there's no reason to accept. Rejecting gives you the option to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or explore other options."
