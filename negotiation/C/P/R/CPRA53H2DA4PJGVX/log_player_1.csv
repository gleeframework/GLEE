Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer of $150, hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150.  I'm also considering Bob's value of $80, knowing he's unlikely to pay more than that.  I'm willing to negotiate but want to see if I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above Bob's offer of $120 but closer to his potential value. I'm hoping this will be more enticing to him while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my $150 minimum, Bob's offer of $130 is above my minimum, and another round of negotiation may lead to a lower price.  It's likely Bob is not willing to go higher, so I'll accept his offer."
