Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting high allows room for negotiation while aiming for the maximum potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum leaves space for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price still significantly above your minimum.
* **Strong but Polite:** The message is direct about the offer while maintaining a professional and courteous tone. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob's valuation, in a real negotiation, you wouldn't have this information.  Gauging a buyer's interest and potential price range is crucial.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup guarantees you won't go below your minimum, providing leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
