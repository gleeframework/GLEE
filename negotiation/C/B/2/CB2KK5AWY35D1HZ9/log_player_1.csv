Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce to Bob that it's worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" signals that you're open to discussing the price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $15,000, he doesn't know your minimum. He might be willing to pay more.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
