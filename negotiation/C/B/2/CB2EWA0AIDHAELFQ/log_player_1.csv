Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's estimated value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you some room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

Keep in mind, this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable amount:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on a mutually beneficial solution:** I'm framing this as a collaborative effort, emphasizing the need to find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation without completely shutting down the deal."
