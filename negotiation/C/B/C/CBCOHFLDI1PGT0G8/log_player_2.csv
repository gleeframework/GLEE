"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  He knows he can buy the product from John for $8,000, so he has a good bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000. However, that's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Please consider it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $11,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's budget at $11,000. While there's a chance they could eventually reach an agreement, Bob is getting close to his maximum acceptable price. Since he has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, it's smarter for Bob to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and Bob could end up paying more than he's willing to."
