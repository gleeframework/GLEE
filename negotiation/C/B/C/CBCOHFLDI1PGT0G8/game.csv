"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000. However, that's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Please consider it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $11,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
