"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This would still allow you a significant profit margin. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $1,025,000? I think this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
