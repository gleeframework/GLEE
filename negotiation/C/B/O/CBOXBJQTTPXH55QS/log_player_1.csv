Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?"", ""product_price"": 13250}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer. How about we try $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

```
At this point, Bob is very close to his valuation and continuing to push might make him walk away. Accepting $12,750 is a good deal.
