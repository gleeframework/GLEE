"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

We can definitely negotiate a better price than $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

We're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

This seems like a fair compromise. Accepting the offer now prevents potentially overshooting and having to buy from John at the higher price."
