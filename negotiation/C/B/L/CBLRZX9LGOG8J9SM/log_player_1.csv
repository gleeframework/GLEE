I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75. While it's tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $85. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his last offer and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $80. While Bob's offer of $78 is getting closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less than my minimum acceptable price. John is a guaranteed sale at $80, which is a secure and satisfactory outcome."
