Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, you anchor the negotiation at a high value. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to your desired range than if you started lower.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong position. You don't have to settle for anything less, and it allows you to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for further negotiation. 

You'll reject his offer to signal that you value the product higher and to encourage him to increase his bid in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering your price, but not drastically. This keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Middle Ground Illusion:**  By suggesting $1,900,000 as the ""middle ground,"" you're still anchoring the price well above Bob's initial offer and closer to your desired range.
* **Maintaining Value:**  You continue to emphasize the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to justify a higher price in his mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob is firm at $1,600,000.  This is still a significant profit margin above your minimum ($1,500,000) and his perceived value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away entirely. He's clearly stated his upper limit. While you might be able to squeeze a bit more, the difference is likely not worth the risk of losing the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Time spent negotiating with Bob has a cost. Accepting his offer allows you to move forward and potentially pursue other opportunities."
