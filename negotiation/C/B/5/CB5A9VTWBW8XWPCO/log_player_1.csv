Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John gives you leverage.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

By offering the product at $119, you're aiming to secure a profit of $39, which is significantly better than selling it to John for just $120. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but this initial offer establishes a strong starting point."
