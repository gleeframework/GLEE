"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects that.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not too low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing that you are serious about negotiating. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a higher price, but it gives you a starting point for further discussions. 
* **Below your max budget:** This offer is still within your budget, giving you some wiggle room to increase the price if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product higher, I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's a significant reduction from her initial price, it's still not within my comfortable range. I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your budget:**  This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, but still within your maximum budget.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still room for Alice to negotiate a slightly higher price, but this counteroffer signals your commitment to a deal.
* **Positioning yourself as a serious buyer:** This offer demonstrates your willingness to meet Alice halfway, making you a more attractive buyer.
* **Strong justification:**  You justify your offer based on the value of the product and your budget, making your counteroffer seem reasonable."
