"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1500000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something truly special. I'm confident this product holds tremendous value, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $1200000 is simply too low.  This product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  How about $1350000? It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's still a great deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1275000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
