Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $1200000 is simply too low.  This product is truly unique, and I believe it's worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  How about $1350000? It's a compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's still a great deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
