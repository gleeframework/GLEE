"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** I have 10 rounds, and I'm confident I can get a better price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  I'm still aware that John is ready to buy for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time is Money:**  I'm moving quickly to reach a deal.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'm still aware that John is waiting in the wings for $12,000, providing me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for.
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe I can still get a higher price with more negotiation.
* **Time is on my Side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to try and secure a better deal.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I know I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $7,750.  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm still emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate, but time is running out.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware I can still get $12,000, which keeps me from accepting a deal that's too low. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting close! How about we settle at $7,500 and call it a deal?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be cautious, but I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's significantly lower than what I'd like.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I can always sell to John for $12,000, which gives me a strong position to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's to see if we can find a middle ground."
