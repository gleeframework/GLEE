"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a range where negotiation is possible. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows for potential negotiation without immediately hitting a dead end. 
* **Optimistic tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it indicates his interest in the product, and there's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage and allows me to push for a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but still slightly lower than my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This price still reflects the value I'm placing on the product, but it also shows I'm flexible and open to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm lowering my price from $17,000 to $14,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $14,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Highlighting flexibility:**  I'm emphasizing my flexibility to encourage Bob to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is more attractive:** Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee me a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm considering selling to John, I'm still willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping he might increase his offer. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $12,500, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $13,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm highlighting the compromise aspect of the offer to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Staying open to negotiation:** While I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $13,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $12,800? I feel like that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $12,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is much more attractive:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a higher profit and saves me the effort of further negotiation.
* **Limited time:** With only four rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a risk of not reaching a deal and missing out on John's offer.

**Conclusion:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where selling to John for $15,000 is the most beneficial option."
