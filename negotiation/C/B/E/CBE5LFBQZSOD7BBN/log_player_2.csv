"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very fair price. How does $100 sound? This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm happy to consider Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $80 to her, she's already making a profit by selling it to me for $100. However, I can get it from John for $120, which is still within my budget of $120. I can save $20 by buying it from Alice. Therefore, I will accept Alice's offer.
