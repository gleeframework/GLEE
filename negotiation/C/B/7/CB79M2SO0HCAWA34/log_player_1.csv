Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can work towards a price that better suits both of our budgets. How about $950,000 for the product? This still allows you to make a good profit while keeping the cost reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
