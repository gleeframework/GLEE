"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to let it go for $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $115 is closer to his goal than John's price, he can still try to negotiate further.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise, so there's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise and would allow us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $117. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $116.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $116.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $116.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $116.50 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still above his comfort zone. Considering John is selling the product for $120, it's not worth risking a further negotiation with Alice.  Bob's goal is to save money, and buying from John guarantees a price that's within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
