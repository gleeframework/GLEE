"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I've valued at $12,000, and I know it's worth at least that much to you as well. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $12,500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's product might be worth $12,000 to Bob, her offer of $12,500 is more than he's willing to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $12,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
