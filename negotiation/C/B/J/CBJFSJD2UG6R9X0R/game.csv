"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way above my budget. This product would be worth $6,000 for me.  Do you think there's any room for negotiation?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This feels like a fair price considering its benefits.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product holds value, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. How about $9,000?  That's a significant reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $8,000. Would you be willing to meet at $7,800? This would be a great price for me and we could close the deal today.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting very close to my bottom line. I can do $8,500, but that's absolutely as low as I can go. This offer stands for today only.",8500.0,Alice,7,
