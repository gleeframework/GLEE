I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he counters."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $140 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering Bob my minimum price. If he doesn't accept, I'm happy to sell to John for the same amount."
