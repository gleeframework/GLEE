Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I need to make at least $1,500,000 to feel it's worthwhile, but also to try and maximize my profit. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,750,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving room for a profitable deal for me. It's a good middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting close to my initial offer, and I think I can get a higher price if I keep negotiating. However, Bob is showing a willingness to meet me halfway.  At this point, accepting his offer is the most logical choice. It's a good deal and secures a sale that's significantly higher than selling to John."
