"I understand that you're willing to move from your initial offer, but $9,100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $8,950? This is my final offer.",8950.0,Alice,5,
