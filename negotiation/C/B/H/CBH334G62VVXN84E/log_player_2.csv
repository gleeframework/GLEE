"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's within your budget, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's always worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1050000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1150000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can still try to negotiate further. Even if you end up buying from John, it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down a bit more.  You might be able to get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than my initial target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $1125000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's unlikely that Alice will go any lower, and you risk wasting time in further rounds. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for a guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
