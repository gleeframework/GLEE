"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm offering the product to you for $8,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and make it $8,400? That's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.",8400.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $8,600. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,7,
