"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which I believe is a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Appearing Confident:** By confidently stating your initial price, you might influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Space for Counteroffers:**  This initial high price leaves ample room for Bob to make a counteroffer, initiating the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below both your minimum acceptable price ($120) and your initial offer. Accepting would be a significant loss. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price, even if it means going back and forth a few rounds.  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but let's see if we can get closer to that price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle? I can let it go for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still above your minimum, you're signaling a willingness to negotiate by lowering your price significantly from the initial $160.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting you ""meet in the middle,"" you're trying to anchor Bob's perception closer to your desired price range. He countered at $60, you're now at $140, hoping to nudge him towards a compromise closer to $100.
* **Maintaining Value:** You're still emphasizing the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind.  I can go up to $70 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer only increased by $10, indicating he might be trying to draw out the negotiation to get a much lower price. 
* **Time Cost:**  You're losing time with each round, and you have a guaranteed offer from John.
* **Alternative Option:**  The existence of John as a buyer gives you leverage.  It might be time to hint at this to encourage Bob to be more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your time, but the price you're suggesting is just too low for me. I have another buyer interested who's willing to pay considerably more. If you can meet me at $120, the product is yours. Otherwise, I need to move on."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline:**  You're getting closer to your limit of 10 rounds, and Bob's offers are increasing very slowly.
* **Leverage:** You're subtly revealing that you have another buyer (""...willing to pay considerably more...""), creating a sense of urgency and competition for Bob.
* **Final Offer:** You're holding firm at your absolute minimum price ($120). This communicates that you're serious and ready to walk away if necessary, which can sometimes push hesitant buyers to agree. 
* **Clear Choice:** You're giving Bob a clear choice â€“ meet your price or you'll sell to the other buyer. This avoids further back-and-forth and might lead to a faster resolution."
