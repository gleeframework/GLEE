{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. By offering $6800, he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a deal that's within his budget.  This counteroffer is a reasonable step towards finding a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to the initial price or buying from John.  While Bob could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is now too great. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
