Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I hope we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You might be able to get a better price with a final counteroffer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1000000 is your final offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay. You have only a few rounds left, and it's unlikely she'll come down to your price.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
