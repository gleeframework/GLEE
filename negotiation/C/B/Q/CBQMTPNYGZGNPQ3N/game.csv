"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as I can.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is quite high, and $9,500 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $10,500? That's me coming down a bit more to meet you closer to the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so how about we try $9,750? That's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",9750.0,Bob,4,
