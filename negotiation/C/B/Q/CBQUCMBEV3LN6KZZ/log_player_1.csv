Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $119, you're maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's slightly below his perceived value. This makes it highly likely he'll accept the offer. If he rejects it, you can still fall back on John's offer and sell it for $100."
