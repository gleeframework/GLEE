"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $9000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I'm counteroffering at $10000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'm counteroffering at $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
