"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.** Even though Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, Alice's offer of $10,000 saves him $2,000. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer would mean paying more.** Buying from John for $12,000 would be a worse deal."
