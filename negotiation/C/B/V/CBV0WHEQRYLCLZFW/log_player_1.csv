Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Finding a middle ground:** $135 is a price point that allows you to make a profit above your minimum ($150) while still being potentially attractive to Bob (who values it at $120). 
* **Alternative buyer:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer, so you're not pressured to accept anything below $150. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price he might find reasonable."
