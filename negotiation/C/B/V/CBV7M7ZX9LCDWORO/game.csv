"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable going down to $9500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to counteroffer at $10200. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $10200. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's worth to both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm counteroffering at $10750. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,
