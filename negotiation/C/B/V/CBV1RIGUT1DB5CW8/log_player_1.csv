Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $119 allows you to capture almost the full value Bob places on it while ensuring you make a profit significantly higher than your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob (who values it more) and maximizing your potential profit."
