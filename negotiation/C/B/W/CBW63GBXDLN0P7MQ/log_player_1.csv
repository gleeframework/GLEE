Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Would you be interested in purchasing it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Is below your minimum value:** This allows you to potentially earn more than your minimum and leaves room for concessions.
* **Provides a clear message:**  It's straightforward and lets Bob know the price and your interest in selling.

It's important to be flexible and adapt your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, you can consider lowering the price or using different negotiation tactics. You can also always fall back on John as a buyer if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $150.**  Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150.** This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer.** This gives me a chance to potentially get a better price while still maintaining my minimum value. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I aim to find a price that's more favorable to me while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a good deal for you and would allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum value:** $140 is closer to my minimum of $150, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Provides a reason for the counteroffer:** I explain my reasoning to Bob, making the counteroffer seem fair.
* **Keeps the negotiation open:** This keeps the door open for further negotiation and allows Bob to potentially come up in price.

This counteroffer balances my need to make a profit with the potential to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  $110 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150. 
* **I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150.** This is a much better option than accepting Bob's offer.
* **The negotiation is unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.**  Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and continuing the negotiation might result in further concessions that would be detrimental to me.

By selling to John, I secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement and avoids further potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
