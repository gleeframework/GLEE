"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,4,
