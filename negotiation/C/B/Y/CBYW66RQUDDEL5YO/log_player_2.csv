"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** My goal is to pay significantly less than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I expect Alice to counter, and this offer leaves space for a compromise that could still save me a lot of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below $1,250,000.  While this is closer to my budget, I know I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when I have a guaranteed better price elsewhere."
