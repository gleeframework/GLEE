"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, Alice, and I think it has a lot of potential. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is more than he originally offered, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can push him closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on this product to be a good investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been firm on his price, and we are running out of rounds. It's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that's acceptable to both of us.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable value, and it's the best option at this point."
