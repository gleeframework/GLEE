"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,800,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, Alice, and I think it has a lot of potential. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on this product to be a good investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
