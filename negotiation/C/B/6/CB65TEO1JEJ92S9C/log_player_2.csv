Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand you see the value in the product, $1400000 is significantly below what it's worth to me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This price reflects the value and potential of the product, and it gives us both a fair deal.
