"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that range?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Would you be open to considering this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, and I think we can get a deal done. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer to you: $1050000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
