"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within his budget. This aggressive approach is meant to put pressure on Alice to negotiate.  He's leaving room to potentially compromise if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $8,250 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000? That's my absolute top price. If it's not acceptable, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push for his ideal price. He's clearly stating his limit, but also hinting that he's prepared to walk away if needed. This creates a sense of urgency for Alice to accept the offer."
