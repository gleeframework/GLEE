"Alice, your product looks great but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000? That's my absolute top price. If it's not acceptable, I might have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
