"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while leaving room for negotiation.  It's also important to remember that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum yet. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left and a guaranteed sale to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise. I'm not going to be too aggressive at this stage, as I want to keep the negotiation open and avoid scaring Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter again, hoping we can reach an agreement. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I also have the option to sell to John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but only by $50,000.  I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but also demonstrating that I still believe the product is worth more. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to raise his offer, and we can find a middle ground. If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more. This offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not yet ready to settle. I'll make one more counteroffer. With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting closer to the point where I might consider selling to John if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1290000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal. With only three rounds remaining, I'm starting to feel the pressure. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John to ensure a sale."
