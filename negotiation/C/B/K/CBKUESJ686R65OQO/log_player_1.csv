Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $925,000 is fair considering its potential. This offer is time-sensitive, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting with $925,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It signals you're serious but open to discussion.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to decide quickly and not delay, potentially losing him the deal.

**Why this is better than offering $1,000,000 directly:**

* **Leaves Money on the Table:** Asking Bob's maximum price immediately gives you no room to potentially earn more.
* **Appears Less Strategic:**  A slightly lower price suggests you've considered value but are willing to negotiate, which can build trust."
