Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there! I'm willing to drop to $11,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has restated her previous offer and indicated it's her final one.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk she'll hold firm, and you'll end up paying John's price of $12,000 anyway.  Accepting $11,000 secures a saving and avoids a potential stalemate."
