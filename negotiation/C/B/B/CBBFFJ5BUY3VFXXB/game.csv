"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",85.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $75? I really think that's a fair price for the product.,75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your hesitation, but $75 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $82.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm open to discussion, but I really believe this product is worth it.",82.5,Alice,5,

I'm not willing to go above $78. I really think that's the most I can afford for this product. Can you meet me at that price?,78.0,Bob,6,
