Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should counter with a lower price to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?

Alice is moving closer to my price range, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. There's a chance I could get it for $10,000 or less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit above my minimum, Bob. How about we try $10,200? It's a bit closer to my target, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. While I could try to haggle a bit more, $10,200 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and get the product."
