Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough in the product to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still demonstrating the value I see in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and getting closer to my minimum value.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale completely and then being forced to sell to John for a lower price."
