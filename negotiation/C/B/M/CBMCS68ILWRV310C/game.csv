,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a lower offer of $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a living. I'll meet you at $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. I'll meet you at $11000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll meet you at $10250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10250.0,Alice,9,

"I've gone as low as I can, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",10000.0,Bob,10,
