"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $12,000 is the absolute lowest I could go, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is close, but to make this work for me, I'd need it to be at least $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make this work for you, but $14,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Bob,6,
