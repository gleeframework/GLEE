"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we agree on $14,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18,000 and $14,000, which is $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $14,500?  That's splitting the difference, and I'm ready to make a deal if you are.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,500, which is $15,250. It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",15250.0,Alice,7,
