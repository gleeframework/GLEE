"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000.
