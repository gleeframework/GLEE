"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $130. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is lower than I'd like.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $130 to $120.  This is a fair price for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $150.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John."
