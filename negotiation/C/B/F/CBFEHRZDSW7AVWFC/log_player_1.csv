Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I can then consider lowering the price slightly or potentially moving on to John if I feel it's not worth negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure you get a quality product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Considering the potential for further negotiation, the risk of Bob walking away, and the certainty of selling to John for $120, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $90."
