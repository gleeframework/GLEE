"Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for your product. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in my product. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep.  How about $1,150,000?  That's a fair price that reflects both of our interests.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident you won't regret this decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
