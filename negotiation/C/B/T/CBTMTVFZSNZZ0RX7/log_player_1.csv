"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. It's a bold move to start high, but with the knowledge that Bob values the product at $1,500,000, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent sum, it's still lower than the target price of $1,400,000 set in the first round.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing for further maneuvering."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to the minimum acceptable amount, it's still below the initial target price. It's worth pushing for a slightly higher price, as there are still rounds available to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is nearing the minimum acceptable amount, there are still a few rounds remaining.  Rejecting this offer maintains the leverage to push for a higher price.  The goal is to secure as much profit as possible, and there's still potential to do so."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to John's offer, it's still not as profitable as the initial target. There are only two rounds remaining, so it's worth pushing for a slightly higher price.  The risk of losing the deal to John is a factor, but the potential for a larger profit is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is the final counteroffer, aiming to secure a price that's closer to the target while leaving room for negotiation in the last round. It's a risky move, as there is only one round left, but it's a calculated risk to secure a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. While $1,100,000 is a decent sum, it's still below the desired profit margin. However, with only one round left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high. Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is better than risking no deal at all."
