{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price, especially when you have a backup option.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's room to haggle.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within the range I'm comfortable with.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in price, which is good, but I'm still not happy with $8,500. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not going to accept anything close to Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this will push Alice closer to my target price of $7,000."

Alice is still too high for my liking.  I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price. I'm not ready to buy from John just yet."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. I'm showing Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm.  I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot and get us to a deal."

I'm still not happy with the price.  I'm going to try one more time to get a better deal before I consider buying from John.  We're getting closer to my target, though, so I'm feeling optimistic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer one last time.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Alice will finally accept it. If she doesn't, I'll go with John."
