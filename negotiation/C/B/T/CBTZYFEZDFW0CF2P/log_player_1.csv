"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is a good profit, we're aiming to maximize the earnings.  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and Bob's initial rejection of a higher price indicates there's room for him to move closer to our desired price point."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to move towards a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a little hesitant at $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to pay $1,090,000. This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.
