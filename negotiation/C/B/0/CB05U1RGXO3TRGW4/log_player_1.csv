"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. This factors in the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** We start high to give ourselves room to negotiate downwards while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant benefit,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth closer to his own valuation ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving negotiation room:** The offer leaves a potential $50,000 profit for Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,000,000) and his perceived value ($1,200,000).  This suggests he's trying to anchor the negotiation very low. Rejecting his offer and providing a reasoned counteroffer will:

* **Signal your position:** You're serious about getting a fair price and won't accept lowball offers.
* **Re-center the negotiation:**  Moving closer to the middle ground encourages a more realistic discussion.
* **Maintain the option of John:**  You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000.  This reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding firm above our minimum price while still showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering our ask by $50,000.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  By emphasizing the ""mutually beneficial agreement"", we remind Bob that a fair deal benefits both parties.
* **Strategic Concession:**  This concession is significant enough to encourage Bob's counteroffer but not so drastic that we lose negotiating leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below your $1,000,000 threshold. His language (""meet you halfway,"" ""compromise"") aims to create a sense of obligation, but you must prioritize your own financial goals.  You have room to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be straightforward, $1,000,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a unique product with the potential to generate significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see an excellent return on this investment."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at our absolute minimum.  This signals firmness to Bob while still offering him a price significantly below his perceived value.
* **Focus on Value, Not Price:** By emphasizing the product's potential and return on investment, we shift Bob's attention away from the price tag and towards the long-term benefits.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct, leaving no room for misinterpretation about your bottom line.

Now it's up to Bob. This offer represents a fair compromise, and you are prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept it. You have John as a reliable backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to compromise, I'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob is fixated on a price below your minimum. Even though he increased his offer, it's clear he's unwilling to meet your valuation.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** His ""final offer"" statement is a negotiation tactic to pressure you. Don't fall for it.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has diminishing returns. You risk losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. You've been patient and clear about your bottom line. Selling to John ensures you get a fair price without further hassle."
