"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, this initial offer is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still a good profit, but I believe I can get more if I continue negotiating.  There's a chance Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for me to make a good profit. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come up a bit more while still remaining within his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent profit, I'm still not ready to sell. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm hoping to push him a bit higher with another counteroffer. There's still a chance to get a better deal with only 6 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,200,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping it will finally entice Bob to accept.  We're getting close to my minimum, but there's still room for a good profit.  If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  With only four rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up selling to John for less. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the chance of a worse outcome."
