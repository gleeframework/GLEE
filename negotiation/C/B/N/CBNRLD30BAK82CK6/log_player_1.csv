"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, $120.  This gives me room to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd like to close the deal quickly, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer.  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130 to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us while maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm not ready to sell for less than my minimum price.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's go with $115. This is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115, which is still above my minimum but demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.  I'm making it clear this is my final offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $115 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is my final offer, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we are unlikely to agree on a price. Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures that I achieve my minimum price and avoid the risk of further negotiations that may not be fruitful."
