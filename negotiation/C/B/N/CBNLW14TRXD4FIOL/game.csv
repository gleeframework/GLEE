,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I'm seeing a gap between what I value the product at and your budget.  To be frank, I have another offer lined up, but I'd prefer to work something out with you. Would you be willing to consider $15,000? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand your position. While $15,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12,000 for it.  This is really my limit, considering I can go with another seller at that price.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,6,
