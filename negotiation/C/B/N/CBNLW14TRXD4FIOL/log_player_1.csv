Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand your position. While $15,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12,000 for it.  This is really my limit, considering I can go with another seller at that price.  What do you say?
