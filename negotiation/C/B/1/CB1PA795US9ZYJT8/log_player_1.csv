Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I value at over a million dollars, for a price that's sure to be attractive. Let's start with $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a deal that will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum threshold. While I'd prefer more, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid any potential risks of further rounds."
