"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,750 is closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
