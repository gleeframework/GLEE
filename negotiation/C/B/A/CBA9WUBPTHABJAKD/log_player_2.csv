"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the maximum value I am willing to pay for the product is $12,000, and Alice is offering the product at that price, there is no immediate benefit to accepting. I can try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I am starting with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and it signals my willingness to negotiate. This price is also within my budget, and I believe it gives me some room to further negotiate if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $12,000 to $11,500. While this is still above my ideal price, it is a significant reduction and closer to my budget. Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
