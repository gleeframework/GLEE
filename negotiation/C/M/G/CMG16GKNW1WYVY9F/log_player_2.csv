"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $110. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:** I want to maintain a positive tone and show Alice I'm genuinely interested in the product, even though I'm not accepting her initial offer. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get the product for under $100. This offer moves me closer to that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. How about $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $90.  Could you meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm reiterating my desired price point of $90. This shows Alice I'm serious about this budget and not going to budge easily.
* **Encouraging Compromise:** By saying ""Could you meet me there?"" I'm subtly prompting Alice to consider splitting the difference between our last offers.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I'm continuing to use friendly language to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering our previous discussions, how about $92 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $92, which is a reasonable price and a good compromise. While I could try to push for $90, there's a risk she might not budge further. Accepting this offer secures me the product at a price I'm happy with."
