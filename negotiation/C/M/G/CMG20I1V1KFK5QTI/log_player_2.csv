"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is $14,500, which is still more than Bob's desired price of $15,000. 
* It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $13,000?  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While $13000 is tempting, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $13500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000.
* While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice could reject further counteroffers and the deal could fall through.
* Accepting the offer at $13,500 is a good compromise and secures the product at a reasonable price."
