"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept immediately.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $80?  "", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** We want to start with a substantial counteroffer to show we're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Fair Offer:** $80 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Openness:**  The message emphasizes our interest while leaving room for Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired value."
