"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It's clear you need to negotiate down significantly. Buying from John right now is an option, but there's a good chance you can get a better deal from Alice with some back and forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with a low counteroffer aims to shift the negotiation significantly in your favor. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""significantly lower for me to consider"") makes your position clearer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording suggests you're willing to negotiate further, but Alice needs to make a substantial move first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While $20,000 represents the value I place on this product, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $15,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's flexibility in her price. 
* **John as Leverage:**  You can use the option of buying from John as leverage to push Alice lower."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I do have another offer in hand, so I'd need to be closer to $11,000 to make a deal work. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Pressure:** This counteroffer keeps pushing the price down towards your target.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning ""another offer"" (even if it's just John) adds a sense of urgency for Alice to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:** Offering $11,000 shows you're willing to compromise, but not at the expense of your budget."
