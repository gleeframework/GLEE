You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $2,000,000 for the product. That's significantly above my budget of $800,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and consider buying the product from John instead.
