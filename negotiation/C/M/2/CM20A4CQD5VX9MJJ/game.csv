"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,
