Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is an aggressive opening offer, but it allows me to potentially maximize my profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping he'll at least counteroffer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.  

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer or switch to selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my initial asking price.  I believe this is a fair price, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  If Bob still rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as the risk of further negotiation may not be worth the potential reward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's only $200 less than my last counteroffer.  I'm starting to feel like this is the best I'm going to get from Bob, and it's definitely more than I'd get selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
