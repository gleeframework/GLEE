"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $1,000,000 by many. I understand its significant worth to you and am willing to extend this opportunity. My initial offer is $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good starting point, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  It's important to keep the option of buying from John in mind, but only as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's a move in the right direction, it's still above what Bob is comfortable paying.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Bob can continue to negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup:** John remains a viable option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I propose a revised offer of $875,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that acknowledges the value it holds for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price:** $875,000 is only $25,000 more than Bob's last offer, and it's significantly lower than what John would charge.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice rejecting Bob's offer and pushing the price back up. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Buying from Alice at $875,000 is a good deal compared to paying $1,000,000 to John. 

This is a good opportunity for Bob to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoid the risk of losing the deal or having to pay more to John."
