"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,375,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,375,000 is a step in the right direction, I still feel that we can find a better middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000.",1360000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,360,000 is a good offer, and I'm very close to accepting.  However, I'm still holding out for a bit more. Let's split the difference again and go with $1,365,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",1365000.0,Alice,5,
