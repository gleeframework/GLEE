Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's our best alternative with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 gives Bob the impression of a discount while leaving a small margin for potential haggling. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going too close to $150 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
