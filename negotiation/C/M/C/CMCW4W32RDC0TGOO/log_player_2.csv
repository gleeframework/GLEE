"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is above your maximum valuation. You should reject and propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify going as high as $1,000,000.  What do you say?"",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states your position and the maximum you're willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While $1,000,000 is a significant drop, it leaves room for Alice to counter and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,125,000? It's a fair price considering its value to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $1,125,000 is still above your $1,200,000 maximum. There's room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting again, you're signaling to Alice that you're serious about a lower price and testing how much further she's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 1062500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  Rather than another large jump, you're proposing a price that splits the difference between your last offer ($1,000,000) and her current offer ($1,125,000). 
* **Signaling Compromise:** By suggesting this compromise, you're demonstrating willingness to move from your initial offer while still pursuing a price that works for you. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** You're still below your maximum, leaving room to potentially go up slightly while putting the pressure on Alice to decide if she'll accept a lower profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,062,500 is closer to what I need, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is now below your $1,200,000 maximum and represents a $100,000 savings compared to buying from John.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or be unwilling to budge much lower. The potential savings from this point are likely to be small.
* **Time Value:** Each negotiation round takes time. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
