Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims high to maximize potential profit. Here's why:

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""good deal."" 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves ample room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can gradually reduce the price, potentially still securing a price well above her minimum. 
* **Fallback Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John. This safety net allows her to confidently aim high with Bob, knowing she won't be left with the product if he rejects the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If he's known to be easily turned off by high prices, a more moderate initial offer might be better.
* **Market Information:**  If Alice had information about similar products selling for even higher prices, she could adjust her initial offer upwards."
