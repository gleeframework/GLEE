This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $825,000, a saving of $175,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try another counteroffer, you risk Alice sticking to her price or walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
