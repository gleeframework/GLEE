"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. This product is worth more than $12000 to us, but I'm willing to consider a fair price that suits both of us. To start, let me propose a price of $15000. I believe this reflects the value we place on it while also leaving room for negotiation. Looking forward to your response.",15000.0,Alice,1,
