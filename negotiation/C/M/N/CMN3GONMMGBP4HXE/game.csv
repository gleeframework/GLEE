"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $95? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
