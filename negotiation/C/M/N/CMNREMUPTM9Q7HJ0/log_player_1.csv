Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us to encourage a positive response.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize my profit:** I want to get as close to my minimum price ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Be flexible:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for significantly less than my minimum price.
* **Maintain control:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John as a backup, ensuring I won't settle for an unfavorable deal."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and get a better offer from Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and control over the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer with a higher price:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Show flexibility while maintaining my bottom line:** I'll aim to find a compromise that allows for a profitable deal for both of us.
* **Prepare for a potential deal with John:** I'm aware of the possibility of selling to John but will only do so if I can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm offering $950,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility. This also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still above Bob's offer, keeping some leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradually decrease the price:** I'm strategically decreasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate while staying close to my minimum price.
* **Maintain communication:**  I'm engaging in dialogue and highlighting the benefits of reaching a deal.
* **Be prepared to sell to John:** If Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer, I'm ready to move on to my backup option."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
