**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I need at least $1,000,000 to consider the sale worthwhile, as I have a guaranteed backup buyer at that price.
* **Negotiation room:** Offering a higher price than the guaranteed amount allows for potential negotiation and a higher profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher offer increases the risk of Bob rejecting, but it also carries the potential for a larger profit.  The $1,500,000 price point strikes a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk.

This offer allows for a potential profit of $500,000 while still ensuring a sale if Bob declines."
