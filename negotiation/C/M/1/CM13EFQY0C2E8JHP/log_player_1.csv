Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position and leverage in the negotiation.

By setting the price at $1,400,000, Alice aims to capture a large portion of the potential profit, while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
