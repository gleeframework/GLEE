{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's estimated value but significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm hoping to start a negotiation that will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  There's potential to get closer to my target without risking selling to John at a lower price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find common ground."

Bob's offer:

Bob is trying to push the price down further.  While $825,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John.  I'll make a counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground."
