"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 to start the negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum. How about we settle at $12,000? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
