# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
