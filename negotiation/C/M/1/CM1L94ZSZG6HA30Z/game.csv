"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $90 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $75? I'm really interested in this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $78? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $81? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
