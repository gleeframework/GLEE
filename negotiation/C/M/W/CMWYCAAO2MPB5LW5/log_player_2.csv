"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $90 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can do $92 for you, though. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit high. It's worth trying to push for a lower price one more time before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $88?"", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $89, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89

Alice has come down to $89, which is a good deal for you. It's only $9 more than what the product is worth to her and significantly cheaper than buying from John. You're getting a good deal and saving some money."
