Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to be flexible and reach a deal.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and I'd like to propose a price of $85. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum but still below what you'd ideally like. You have a better chance at getting closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great product and I'm confident it's worth that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay, and you're close to your ideal price. Accepting this offer maximizes your profit while ensuring a successful transaction."
