Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm also including a friendly message to make the negotiation feel more personal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price of $100. While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a great price for this product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price of $100, I'm concerned that continued negotiation with Bob may lead to a lower final price.  John is offering me my minimum price, so I'm going to go ahead and sell to John to ensure a guaranteed profit."
