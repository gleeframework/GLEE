"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $140? It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
