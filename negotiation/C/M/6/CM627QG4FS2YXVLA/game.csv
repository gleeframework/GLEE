"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,450,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you've described.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and it allows us both to have a successful transaction.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
