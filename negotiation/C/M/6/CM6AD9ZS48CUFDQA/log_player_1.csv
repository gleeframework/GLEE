Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the value and potential public listing, we provide a subtle reason for the higher price without being too aggressive. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
