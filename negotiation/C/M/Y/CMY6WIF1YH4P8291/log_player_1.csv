{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value of $100. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate further, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $120 is better than selling to John, but I think I can get a better price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm offering $135. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping he'll find it acceptable."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm hoping that with another counteroffer, we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
