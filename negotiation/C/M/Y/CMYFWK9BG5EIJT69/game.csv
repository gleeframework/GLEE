"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,900 as a final compromise. This price is very close to your offer, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
