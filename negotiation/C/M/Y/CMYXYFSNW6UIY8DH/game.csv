"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a significant investment, but I need to be within my budget. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is a significant offer, it's unfortunately below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to compromise, however.  Let's meet in the middle at $1200000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
