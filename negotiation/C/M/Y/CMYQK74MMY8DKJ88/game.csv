"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep.  Considering the value to me and your own cost basis, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This seems like a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $980,000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's finalize this deal.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,020,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and your desired profit margin. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
