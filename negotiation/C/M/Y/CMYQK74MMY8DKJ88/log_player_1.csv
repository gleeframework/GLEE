{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep.  Considering the value to me and your own cost basis, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This seems like a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is better than John's offer, I want to try and get closer to my desired value. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $980,000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll try to nudge him closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,020,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and your desired profit margin. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $990,000 is a significant improvement and very close to my ideal price. It's also more than what John is offering, so I'm going to accept and close the deal."
