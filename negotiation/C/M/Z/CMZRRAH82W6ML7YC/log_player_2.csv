"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget and hopefully shows I'm serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to my counteroffer price, so it makes sense to accept and secure the product.  I'm saving $1,500 compared to buying from John."
