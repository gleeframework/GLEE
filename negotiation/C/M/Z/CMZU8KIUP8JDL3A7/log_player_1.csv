"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  The price isn't too high that Bob would immediately reject it, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'd like to close the deal, $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is interested in the product, so there's room for a counteroffer. 
* **Keeping options open:**  Selling to John for $120 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by dropping my price to $110, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I'm expressing appreciation for Bob's interest and highlighting the benefit of closing the deal.
* **Still above my minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer suggests there's still room for a higher price.
* **Keeping options open:** Selling to John for $120 is still the best option, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $112. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm only lowering the price by $2, showing I'm serious about reaching a deal but not giving in too much.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  I'm mentioning closing the deal to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept.

I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but this offer is more likely to be accepted by Bob while still getting a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While Bob is showing some willingness to increase his offer, it's not getting close enough to my minimum.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:**  Selling to John for $120 remains the most profitable choice, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob while keeping that option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, but $108 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $110. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $110, the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness appeal:**  I'm reinforcing the idea of a fair price for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 

While $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal. It's a risky move, as I might not get a better offer, but I'm hoping the final offer strategy will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $108. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in Round 8, with only two rounds left. 
* **No significant progress:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and he's not showing a willingness to go higher.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  It's highly unlikely that Bob will accept a price closer to my desired value in the remaining two rounds. Selling to John for $120 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation.

It's a tough decision, as I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, but with time running out and Bob not budging, selling to John is the most sensible choice."
