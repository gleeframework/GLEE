Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While we know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, we don't want to limit ourselves. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if it's something he needs or desires greatly.
* **Below John's Offer:** We have a safety net with John's offer of $15,000. By offering it to Bob for $19,000, we aim for a higher profit while still being below our guaranteed sale price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always lower your price slightly during the negotiation process."
