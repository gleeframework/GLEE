"Bob,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand its value to you, but I'm looking for something closer to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, given your assessment of the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering its value to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
