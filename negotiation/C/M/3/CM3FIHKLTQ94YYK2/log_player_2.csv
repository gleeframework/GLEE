"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While the product is worth $800,000 to you, it's worth $1,200,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation. It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice rather than accepting her offer or buying from John at $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand its value to you, but I'm looking for something closer to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, given your assessment of the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to my target price, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 and see if we can find a middle ground. Rejecting her offer will allow for further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $900,000.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant price reduction, and it's possible that Alice will become less willing to negotiate.  Accepting her offer allows me to acquire the product for a price that is within my budget and provides a decent savings compared to buying from John."
