"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm counteroffering at $9200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
