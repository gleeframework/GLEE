"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price? I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,000,000. How about we settle on $1,100,000? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you moving towards my price point. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,050,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, don't you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a small compromise, but it's still a good price for the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
