Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate, but it's still a significant profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than $10,000, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to accept it. While it's not ideal, it's still a good profit, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
