"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? This would be a fair deal considering the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're very close! I can see we're both motivated to make this work. How about we settle at $10,250? This represents a small compromise for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my absolute limit is $10,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,6,
