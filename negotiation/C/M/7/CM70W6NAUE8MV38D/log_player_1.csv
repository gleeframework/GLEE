{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's value of $80 but below my minimum acceptable value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer of $90 but still above my minimum acceptable value of $120."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
