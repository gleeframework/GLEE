Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a deal without leaving too much money on the table. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, a price of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but still represents a significant profit margin for me. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:** By positioning this as a special offer for Bob, it might make him more inclined to consider the deal seriously."
