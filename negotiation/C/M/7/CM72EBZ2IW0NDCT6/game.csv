"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking to get closer to $100 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be ready to buy today.",100.0,Bob,4,
