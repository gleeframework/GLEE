**Reasoning:**

Bob seems stuck at a price point significantly lower than our desired range.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. Accepting John's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at a price we find acceptable."
