"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $11,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? I'm looking to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price. How about $10,500? This still gives you a great value, and it's fair to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I'm still not able to meet at $10,500. I would like to propose $10,000 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
