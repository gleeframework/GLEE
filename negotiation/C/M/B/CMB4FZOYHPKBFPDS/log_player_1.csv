{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,500? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,200, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, Bob's offer of $11,200 is getting close.  It's only $800 less than my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. I'll accept his offer and move on."
