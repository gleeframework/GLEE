"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $11500? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11500. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target of $10000. Can you consider a price of $11200? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal if you're willing to come down a bit more.",11200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see your point, but I'm really not comfortable going below $11400. This is a fair price, given the value of the product and our negotiation so far. Let's find a way to make it work. What do you think?",11400.0,Alice,5,
