Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure you can make a good profit with it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000), but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, emphasizing the value Bob would get. 
* **Flexibility:** By offering a lower price than my minimum, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter-offer.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is serious about buying the product and how high he's willing to go.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can either counter-offer or move on to John, who guarantees my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  I believe I can still push for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain my leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm serious about getting my desired price.
* **Gain information:**  See how committed Bob is to buying the product and if he's willing to go higher.
* **Explore a higher counteroffer:**  I can try to close the gap with a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.

This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my profits while still keeping the option to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing flexibility while still trying to achieve a higher price. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and  urging Bob to finalize the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

This counteroffer allows me to: 
* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Maximize profits:** If he accepts, I'll be closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:** If he rejects, I can still choose to sell to John or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your offer at $1,250,000. I am still committed to finding a price that aligns with the value I place on the product. My latest counteroffer is $1,225,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob's counteroffer is just $75,000 below my desired price.  It's getting very close to my minimum value, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Considering:

* **Bob's commitment:** He's clearly committed to buying the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for lost time:**  Further rounds of negotiation could drag out the process.
* **Guaranteed value with John:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000, which acts as a safety net.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that's only slightly below my minimum, and it's more profitable than selling to John immediately. It also avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or no deal at all."
