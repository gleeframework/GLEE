"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000.  This represents a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the potential benefits it holds.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $1200000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, reflecting the potential benefits of this product for you.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1275000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1275000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe this price offers a valuable opportunity for you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
