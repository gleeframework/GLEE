"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,500,000.  This represents a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the potential benefits it holds.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent sum, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can potentially secure a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, reflecting the potential benefits of this product for you.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1275000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,275,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe this price offers a valuable opportunity for you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. We've both made compromises, but I believe I can still get a better offer. It's risky to accept at this point as we are nearing the halfway mark in the negotiations, and John is always a viable option.  I want to see if Bob will budge further before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum value, but I'm willing to come down one last time to $1,280,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value this product offers you.  It's time to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1280000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1220000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds remaining, the negotiation has stalled.  Bob's offer of $1,220,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  While I could counteroffer again, I'm concerned that we may not reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale and ensures I don't end up with nothing."
