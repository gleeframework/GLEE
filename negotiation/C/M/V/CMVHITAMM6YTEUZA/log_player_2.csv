"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110, accepting her offer is the best decision. This saves you $10 compared to buying from John.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially losing the deal or ending up paying the same amount."
