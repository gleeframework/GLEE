Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase the product. I know it would be valuable to you, so I've priced it at $14,000 for a quick sale."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 discount (making it more appealing than risking a no-deal), while you secure a $2,000 profit above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who represents a higher potential profit margin, while still having the security of John's offer if needed."
