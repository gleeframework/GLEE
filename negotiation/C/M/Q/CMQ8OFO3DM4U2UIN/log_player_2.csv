"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $14,500. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John's deal."
