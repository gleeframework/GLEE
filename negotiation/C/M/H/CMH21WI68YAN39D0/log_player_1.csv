Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm still guaranteed my minimum price from John. 
* **Confident tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
