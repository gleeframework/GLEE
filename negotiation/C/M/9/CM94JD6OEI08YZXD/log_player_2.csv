Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its overall worth to me. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to compromise that much. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a price that aligns with my budget.  Would you be open to considering $775,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 775000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, especially after stating her last offer was final. You can get the product for your target price from John without further negotiation."
