"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see where you're coming from, but I have a tight budget. Let's make this simple - I'm willing to pay $100 even. That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $100 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $115. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",115.0,Alice,7,
