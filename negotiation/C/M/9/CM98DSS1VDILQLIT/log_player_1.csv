"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see and allows for a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
