"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see and allows for a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
