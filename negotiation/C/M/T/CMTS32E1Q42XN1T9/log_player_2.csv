Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and my minimum of $110, so I'll offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're not willing to budge from $95, Bob. However, I've already made a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $99. This is my absolute final offer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","Alice is getting desperate, and I can sense that she's willing to walk away from the deal. I think I've made a strong case for the price, and I'm not willing to pay more than $95. Since $99 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, I'll reject her final offer and stick with my previous counteroffer.

However, I'm also aware that I can get the product from John for $80, which is an even better deal. So, I'll choose to buy the product from John instead.
