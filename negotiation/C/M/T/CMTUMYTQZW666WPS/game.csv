"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we try $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",13000.0,Alice,5,
