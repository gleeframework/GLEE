Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise at $14,000, which is still a great deal for you.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly from her initial high offers. It's clear she's aiming for a price well above your limit.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice when you can get the product for significantly less elsewhere."
