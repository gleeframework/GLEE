"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Could you consider that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $125 is a bit low for you, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
