Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $115. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $115 is still more than we want to pay.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
