Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you!  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob balks.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the message to highlight the potential value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to see it as a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that this is an offer, implying that I'm open to discussion and negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response (accept, reject, counteroffer) and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Counteroffers:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll consider his offer and either accept it or make a counteroffer, always trying to maximize my profit while keeping the deal alive.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, knowing I can sell the product for at least $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to settle for it. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $9,000.
* **Analyzing Bob's Response:**  I'll pay close attention to Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he seems resistant, I might consider lowering my price further, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows good faith and demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, emphasizing that it's not just about me getting the most money.
* **Keep the Deal Alive:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value while still making the deal appealing to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer, as his reaction will determine my next move.
* **Potential Outcomes:**
    * **Accept:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price for the product.
    * **Counteroffer:**  If Bob counteroffers, I'll carefully consider his new price and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. 
    * **Reject:** If Bob rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might be possible, but the potential for a significantly higher price is limited.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I keep rejecting offers and Bob walks away, I risk having to accept John's lower offer of $8,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting the Offer:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a price that's close to my minimum and avoid the risk of losing the deal.
* **Moving Forward:**  I'll finalize the sale with Bob and ensure a smooth transaction."
