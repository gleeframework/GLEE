"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe the product's unique features and benefits warrant a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique features and benefits, but I still think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1000000. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $1025000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the final concession, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to walking away, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to make one last offer: I'll meet you at $1015000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $990000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll have to bid farewell.",990000.0,Bob,10,
