"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer at $15,000 doesn't achieve that. Buying from John for the same price also isn't ideal. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to establish a lower price point early in the negotiation. Alice may reject this offer, but it will give her a clear idea of my desired price range and hopefully lead to a more favorable counteroffer from her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point, but $13,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my counteroffer. $12,000 is a good compromise point between Alice's last offer and my initial counteroffer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal but am also willing to negotiate."
