"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. Can you consider that?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. That's the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I can do $132, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $132?",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go any lower than $135, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll meet you at $132.50. That's the best I can do.",132.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus, but I'm still not sure if I can meet you at $132.50. I can do $131, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $131?",131.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go any lower than $135, and I've already thrown in a bonus to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to meet you at $132.50, but I'm not budging from that. It's take it or leave it.",132.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $131, and I'm not interested in playing games. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $150. I'm not going to engage in any further negotiations. The offer is final.",131.0,Bob,10,
