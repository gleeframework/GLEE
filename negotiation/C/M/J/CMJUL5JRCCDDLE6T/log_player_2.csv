"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know if you're interested.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  If this price isn't right for you, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's no need to spend the extra $200,000. Alice is likely using negotiation tactics (mentioning another buyer) to try and push you towards a quicker decision."
