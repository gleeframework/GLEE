"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know if you're interested.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  If this price isn't right for you, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
