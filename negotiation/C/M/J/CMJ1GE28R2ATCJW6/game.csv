"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
