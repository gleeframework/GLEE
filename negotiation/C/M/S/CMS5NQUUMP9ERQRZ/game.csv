"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $125? That gives us both some room to be happy. Let me know your thoughts.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and appreciate your efforts.  $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's close this deal.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can offer at this time. I hope you'll consider it.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer to where we need to be, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $122.50. This compromise allows us to both get a fair deal and close this transaction. Let's make it happen.",122.5,Alice,7,
