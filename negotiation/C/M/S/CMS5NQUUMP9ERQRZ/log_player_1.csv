Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $100 but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price range with continued negotiation. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal within the remaining rounds, especially given that John is willing to pay $150."

```
