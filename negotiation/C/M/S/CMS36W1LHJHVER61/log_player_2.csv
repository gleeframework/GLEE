"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what I'd get from another buyer and more than what it's worth to you. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you want to pay. You can get it for $1,200,000 from John, so rejecting this offer makes the most financial sense."
