Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,527,500. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,527,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,527,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is clearly very interested but also trying to get the best possible price.  While there's a chance to push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $1,527,500 guarantees a significant profit over your alternative option (John's $1,200,000 offer).  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing Bob altogether."
