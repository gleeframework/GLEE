Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net.  
* **Perceived Value:** The message implies the product's value might be even higher than Bob's perceived value of $120, potentially enticing him to pay more.
* **First Refusal:** Offering it to Bob first might make him feel like he's getting a priority deal. 

**Important:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and Bob's potential negotiating style, you might choose to offer a lower price initially."
