"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes both the product's worth and your interest. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still feel that $1,650,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
