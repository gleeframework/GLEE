"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, Bob, but I'm still not getting as close to my minimum price as I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we discuss $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,500. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I'm at a point where I need to prioritize getting the best price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price that meets my minimum. Let's discuss $18,000, my final offer",18000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're at a point where you need to prioritize getting the best price for the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $18,000. Unfortunately, I've reached my limit and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think we've reached an impasse. I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,10,
