Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its significant value proposition."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
