{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit above $10,000, so how about $9,800? I'm getting closer to my target, and I think we can meet in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $9,800 is a good deal and it's closer to my target than selling to John.  It's also possible that further negotiation will only lead to more time wasted and potentially a lower final price."
