I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I can still get a higher price, and I'm not willing to settle for just a little more than my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,500 for this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd love to keep pushing for more, Bob's offer of $13,300 is getting close to my target.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $12,000. I'll take the $13,300 and close the deal."
