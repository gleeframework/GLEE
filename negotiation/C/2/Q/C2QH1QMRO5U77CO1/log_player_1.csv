"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept anything below my minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with a price of $8,500, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm also emphasizing the benefit of a deal for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can find a better solution within my budget. Would $8,200 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's worth accepting this offer as I'm unlikely to get a better deal with Bob.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Bob may reject my counteroffer and I would end up selling to John for a lower price."
