We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and negotiating.  It's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 6

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting close to a point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price for a product of this value."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and my previous offer of $950,000. How about we try $987,500? I'm willing to make one more compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we're close to John's offer, Bob is still engaging and showing a willingness to move. Accepting this offer gives us a significant profit over our fallback option.  It's always possible to get more, but this feels like a good balance of risk and reward at this stage."
