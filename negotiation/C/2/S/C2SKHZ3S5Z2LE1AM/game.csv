"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, as another buyer is ready to purchase it at the same price. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
