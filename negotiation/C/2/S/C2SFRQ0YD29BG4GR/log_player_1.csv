Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price, emphasizing the value to Bob. This can make him more receptive to the offer. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then either counteroffer or switch to John, who offers my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value you place on it and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer to $1,075,000. This allows for some room for further negotiation while still moving closer to my desired price.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This can help convince him to come closer to my offer.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired profit and Bob's perceived value. This strategy is aimed at finding a mutually beneficial deal while maximizing my own earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $1,062,500 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $1,062,500 is getting closer to my minimum desired price.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's better to secure a deal now than to risk losing him and needing to accept John's offer, which is still significantly lower than what I could make from Bob."
