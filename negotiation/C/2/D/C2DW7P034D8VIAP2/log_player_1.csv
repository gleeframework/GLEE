"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I can still do better. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? That's a fair compromise, and still gives you a great deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I could potentially try to squeeze out a little more, Bob's offer is at my minimum price, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Plus, there's always the risk that the negotiations will go south and I'll end up having to sell to John for the same price. It's better to secure the deal now."
