"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $825000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you consider my new offer?",800000.0,Bob,4,
