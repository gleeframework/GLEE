# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to purchase it from me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $11,000. I'll offer you the product for $12,750. This is a fair and reasonable price, and I believe you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'll make a new offer that's closer to your target. I'll sell the product to you for $12,250. This is a fair price, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $12,250 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price."
