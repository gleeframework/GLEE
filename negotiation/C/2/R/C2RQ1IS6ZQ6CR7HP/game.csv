"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,200. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,350. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.",9350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,350. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,6,
