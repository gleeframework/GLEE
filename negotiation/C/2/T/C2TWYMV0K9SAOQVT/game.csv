"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still willing to work with you, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my initial offer.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",11750.0,Bob,4,
