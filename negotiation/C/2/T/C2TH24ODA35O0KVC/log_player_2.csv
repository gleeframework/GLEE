"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $140 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($120). You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to come down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but $130 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $135 is still within your budget.  While further negotiation might be possible,  it's getting close to the value of the product to you.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further rounds and potential counteroffers that might push the price back up."
