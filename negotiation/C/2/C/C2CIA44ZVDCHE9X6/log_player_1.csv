{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum but not outrageous. It also emphasizes your willingness to negotiate, leaving room for Bob to counter without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is more than your minimum, it's still quite a bit lower than your initial offer and potentially leaves room for further negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to work with."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $12000.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to your desired price, and continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a stalemate or a lower price. It's a good compromise, and accepting it ensures a sale with a decent profit."
