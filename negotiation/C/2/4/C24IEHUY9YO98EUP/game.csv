"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $8800 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9200, which is still a good price for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $9100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",9100.0,Alice,5,
