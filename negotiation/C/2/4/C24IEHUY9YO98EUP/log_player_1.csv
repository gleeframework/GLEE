"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $8800 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is still a good price for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8900 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get him to raise his offer further.  There are still a few rounds left, and I have the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $9,100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $8700 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,700 is even lower than his previous offer, indicating he is not willing to budge much. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's highly unlikely that I will be able to get him to pay closer to my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
