"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value it holds, my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,000,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is closer to the actual value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
