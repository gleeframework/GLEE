"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? That way we both get a little closer to where we need to be.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off on my price. Let's meet in the middle at $11,125. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both of our positions. What do you say?",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
