"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $120 for it?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $150, and Alice's offer is $120. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still more than your maximum budget of $150. Therefore, you should reject the offer and buy from John."
