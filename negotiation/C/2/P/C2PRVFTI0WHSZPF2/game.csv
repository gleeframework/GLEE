"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to another buyer for $1,500,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
