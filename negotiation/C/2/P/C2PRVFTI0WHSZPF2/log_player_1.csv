Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
