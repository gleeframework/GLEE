"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below what the product is worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to another buyer for $1,500,000 if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, she has stated it's her final offer, making it risky to reject and potentially lose the deal.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if she's willing to budge.  If not, it's time to go with John."
