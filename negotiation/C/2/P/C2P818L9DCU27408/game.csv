Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think?,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $75? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $75 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $68?",68.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $68. How about we meet in the middle again at $72? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",72.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your patience.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little bit. How about $70? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $72 and $70, which would be $71. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",71.0,Alice,7,
