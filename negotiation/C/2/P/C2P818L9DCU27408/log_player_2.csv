Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $72 and $70, which would be $71. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $71. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $71
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $70.  While we might be able to squeeze out another dollar in further rounds, it's getting riskier. Accepting $71 guarantees a good deal without the risk of Alice breaking down negotiations entirely."
