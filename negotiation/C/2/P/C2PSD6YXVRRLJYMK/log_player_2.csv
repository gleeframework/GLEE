"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  There's room to get closer to my $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  It's a starting point, and we can always meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Let me see what I can do. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I'm still willing to see if I can get closer to $80. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This offer aims to split the difference between her latest offer and my previous one.  It's a fair compromise and keeps the negotiation moving."
