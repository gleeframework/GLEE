"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob can potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate.  He can still aim for a price closer to his ideal $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  thanks again for your flexibility. $17,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but  $16,000 is the absolute highest I can go right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
