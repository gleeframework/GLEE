Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at the special price of $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while also acknowledging your interest in it."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 gives Bob a significant saving ($150,000) compared to his perceived value, making it a tempting offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a secure offer from John at $1,000,000, ensuring I won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a safety net with John's offer."
