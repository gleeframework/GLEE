"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to work this out. "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm close to my target price and I don't want to give up too much.  Let's see if I can push for a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,600. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, $8,600 is a good compromise and secures a sale.  The risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential to gain a few hundred dollars more."
