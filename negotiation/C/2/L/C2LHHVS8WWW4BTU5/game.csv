Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's the maximum I can offer. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1500000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
