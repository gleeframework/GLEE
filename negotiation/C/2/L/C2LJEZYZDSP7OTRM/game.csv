"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it reflects the value the product holds for you.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $975,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If we can't find a compromise, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $950,000. I'm trying to find a compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,6,
