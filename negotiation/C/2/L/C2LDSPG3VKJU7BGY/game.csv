"Alice, $25000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm firm on my offer of $8000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
