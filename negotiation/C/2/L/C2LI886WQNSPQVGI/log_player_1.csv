"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $13000, which is a fair compromise.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good price considering the negotiations, and it's closer to my minimum than what I would get from John. It's time to close the deal."
