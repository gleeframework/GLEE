"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $13000, which is a fair compromise.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
