"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can potentially get an even better price by negotiating with Alice. There are still 9 rounds left, giving him ample opportunity to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a middle ground price, aiming to be realistic but also pushing for a significant discount. Offering $12,500 shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing Alice towards his target price range. This also sets the stage for potential further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $12500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still above Bob's target price of $12,000. He's willing to pay $12,500, and this offer is a good starting point for further negotiation. There are still 7 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair compromise.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show a willingness to meet Alice halfway. He's still below his target price but is moving closer to Alice's offer.  This move sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."
