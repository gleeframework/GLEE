"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000.  This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer if I'm strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It also remains higher than John's offer, ensuring I'm still getting a good deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. It's less than John's offer, and we're only halfway through the negotiations. There's still time to get a better price from Bob."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,450,000. This is still above Bob's last offer, but it shows continued flexibility. I'm hoping to reach a compromise and get a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still securing a deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price one more time to $1,400,000. This is right at the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to meet halfway and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting uncomfortably close to my minimum. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer."
