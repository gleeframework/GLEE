"Alice, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the market value of this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know if this price point works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
