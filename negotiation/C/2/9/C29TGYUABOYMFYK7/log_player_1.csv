{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving me room to negotiate. It also shows I'm willing to work with him, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate."
