Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's concessions suggest there's room for negotiation."

Round 6

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is still making concessions.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk of walking away is relatively low. We'll push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're trying to find the best possible price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident this product will bring you significant value that justifies this price."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We reiterate the product's value to Bob, justifying the price and potentially swaying him.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We make a smaller concession than before, signaling our position while still encouraging Bob to meet us closer to our target."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, and I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront. Can we meet at $1,075,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer in the remaining two rounds.
* **Strong Offer:** $1,075,000 is a significant amount, well above our minimum and a substantial profit.
* **Upfront Payment:**  The promise of upfront payment reduces risk and provides immediate capital.

While we were aiming for a higher price, accepting this offer mitigates the risk of losing the deal entirely and ensures a substantial profit."
