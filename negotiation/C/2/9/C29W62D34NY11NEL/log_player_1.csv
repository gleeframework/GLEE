Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your effort, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $25,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me. I understand you're on a budget, but this product is truly special and worth a bit more.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $20,000?  Let's find a middle ground and make this work."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $18000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one!  While $18,000 is still below my initial target, it's getting closer and I'm not sure how much further I can push Bob.  We're running out of rounds, so I'll accept Bob's offer and avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
