Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to pay closer to $12,000. This feels like a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $14,000.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price still allows me a decent profit, while remaining within your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $12,500? This would give us both a good deal and a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
