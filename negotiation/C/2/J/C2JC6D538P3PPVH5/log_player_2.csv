Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable given the product's value.
