Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}
