"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a steal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $8000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable given the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
