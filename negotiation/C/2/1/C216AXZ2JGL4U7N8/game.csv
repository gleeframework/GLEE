"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is a tempting offer, I feel the product's true value is higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a significant value proposition.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this could be a good compromise.",10800.0,Bob,4,
