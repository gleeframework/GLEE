"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you ($1,200,000).  You have a lot of room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. There's no reason to accept the first offer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product is indeed valuable to me, $800,000 is a bit too low to be fair. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  That's a significant amount, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $900,000 is still significantly higher than her perceived value of $1,000,000.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get an even better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your offer while still giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price. Let's finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your counteroffer:**  $880,000 is very close to the $875,000 you offered.  It's likely further negotiation won't get you a significantly lower price.
* **You're saving a lot:**  You're getting the product for $880,000, which is a significant discount compared to its value to you ($1,200,000) and John's price ($1,200,000). 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting Alice's offer risks her sticking to $880,000 or even going back up in price. You could also lose time negotiating and potentially miss out on buying the product.

Accepting the offer secures a great deal for you with minimal risk."
