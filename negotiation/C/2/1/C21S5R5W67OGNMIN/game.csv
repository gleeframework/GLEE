"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product is indeed valuable to me, $800,000 is a bit too low to be fair. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  That's a significant amount, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your offer while still giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price. Let's finalize the deal.",880000.0,Alice,5,
