"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $135. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $130. Would you be willing to accept this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I think $140 is the minimum I can go. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway once more.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go back to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $145 is the absolute minimum I can go. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $135 again? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway once more, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go back to $135. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm starting to get concerned that we might not reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $150 is the absolute maximum I can go. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we've been negotiating for a while, and I appreciate your willingness to make concessions. However, $150 is still a bit too high for me. I've decided to take a different approach. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I think the product is worth $120 to me, and I'm willing to buy it from John for that price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at that price. If not, I'll have to say goodbye to the deal. Would you be willing to meet me at $120?",120.0,Bob,10,
