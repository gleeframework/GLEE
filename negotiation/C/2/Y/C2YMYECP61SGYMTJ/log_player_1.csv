Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still a significant profit.
