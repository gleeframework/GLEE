"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth significantly more than $1000000, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think will be mutually beneficial. I'm asking for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.  I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable, and I'm willing to discuss the details further if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
