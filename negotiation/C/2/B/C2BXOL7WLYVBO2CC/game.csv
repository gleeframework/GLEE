"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit high for you, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll come down to $9,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product to you with my minimum price of $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about $7,500?  That's a firm offer from me.  I need to stay within a certain budget, and this is really pushing it for me.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,7,
