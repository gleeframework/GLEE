"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to sell you this product! I'm thinking of a price of $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than $150, you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit high for me. How about $125?  I'm really interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I'm still open to negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter-Offer:** Alice is now offering $127.50, which is closer to your desired price point. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might become less flexible or even reject any further offers. 
* **Time & Effort:**  Negotiating further might take more time and effort. 
* **Good Deal:**  $127.50 is a good price, given that your maximum is $150 and Alice's minimum is likely around $120.

By accepting Alice's offer, you are getting a good deal and saving money compared to buying from John."
