Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it to Bob slightly below my guaranteed price from John gives me a chance to maximize profit.
* **Creating Urgency:** The message is framed to suggest a deal and encourage a quick decision from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  While $8,000 is Bob's valuation,  starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  It also reinforces the product's value. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk for the potential to earn an extra $1 from my guaranteed sale to John."
