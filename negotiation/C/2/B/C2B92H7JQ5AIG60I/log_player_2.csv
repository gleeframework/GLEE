"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate a better price! Alice's offer is close to my maximum, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer leaves room for me to potentially meet in the middle while still staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting me halfway, which is a good sign she's willing to negotiate. However, there's still room for me to save more before considering John's offer. Let's continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. This keeps the negotiation moving and increases the chances of securing a favorable price before I need to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $13.50, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and this offer saves me a significant amount compared to John's price. It's unlikely I'll get a better deal from Alice, and risking further negotiation might lead to her withdrawing the offer entirely.  It's a good deal, so I'll accept."
