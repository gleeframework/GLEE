Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product's value to me helps Bob understand why this is a fair price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Using ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while leaving room for a potential win-win outcome."
