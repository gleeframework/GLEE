Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room for a good deal. Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, $975,000 is still too high. He should try to negotiate a lower price.  He's getting close to his limit though, so he needs to decide how much more he's willing to pay."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
