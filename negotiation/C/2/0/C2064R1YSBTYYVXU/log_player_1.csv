{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it at a significant discount. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room for a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it leaves some room for profit for you. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm rejecting his offer and will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000.  This is a fair price, as it's closer to your asking price than my previous offers, and it's within my budget. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and want to secure a guaranteed sale.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids further negotiation."
