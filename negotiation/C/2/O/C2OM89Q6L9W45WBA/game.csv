"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from that, so I'm thinking of offering $1075000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1075000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1125000. This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go up to $1125000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1075000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
