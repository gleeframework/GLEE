{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also provides an opening for Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work something out closer to my budget. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is just above my minimum of $100, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  It's better than selling to John for $100, and the negotiation process has been pretty quick."
