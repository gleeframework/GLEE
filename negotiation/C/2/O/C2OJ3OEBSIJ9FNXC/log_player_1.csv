Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  By offering a price that's lower than John's offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I am confident that I can still secure a better deal with Bob or sell the product to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price or sell to John for a better price.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to reach a more mutually beneficial agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows flexibility while also emphasizing the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $12,750. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer. I'll meet you at $12,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $15,000, it's a better deal than accepting Bob's offer of $12,750.  Bob has indicated that he's unwilling to go higher, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John ensures that I get my desired price, although it means losing out on the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob."
