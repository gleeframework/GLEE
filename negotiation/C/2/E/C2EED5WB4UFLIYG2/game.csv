"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my absolute maximum is $110. Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $110, so I'll offer it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
