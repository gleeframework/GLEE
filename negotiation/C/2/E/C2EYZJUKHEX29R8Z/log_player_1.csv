Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately turn him off.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the value of the product for Bob might make him more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, knowing I have a backup option in John who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Value to Bob:**  Bob clearly sees the value of the product, as evidenced by his willingness to pay $900,000.  This suggests there's potential for him to go higher. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a safety net in John, so I can afford to be a bit more demanding.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than $1,000,000, aiming to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $950,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).
* **Emphasize Fairness:** The message highlights that this price is fair for both parties.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message expresses a willingness to make a deal, which could encourage Bob to agree.
* **Safety Net:**  I'm still within a comfortable range, knowing that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob clearly sees the value of the product and is willing to pay close to my minimum. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a secure backup with John's offer of $1,200,000, which gives me leverage to continue negotiations. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer ($950,000).  This will show him that I'm serious about making a deal while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $930,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm making a small concession, lowering the price by $20,000 from my previous offer. This shows I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Finality:** I'm framing $930,000 as my ""absolute lowest"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open Invitation:** The message ends with a question, prompting Bob to make a decision.

**Plan:** If Bob still rejects, I'll stick with my ""absolute lowest"" of $930,000 for one more round. If he rejects again, I'll accept John's offer to ensure I get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $910,000 is only $10,000 above my absolute minimum, which I've already stated is $930,000. There's no significant leverage for me to continue negotiation at this point.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially not getting a better offer. It's more advantageous to secure John's offer and move on.

**Conclusion:** It's time to end negotiations with Bob and finalize the deal with John to secure the highest possible price for my product."
