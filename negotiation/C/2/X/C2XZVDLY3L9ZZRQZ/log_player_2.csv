"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is higher than your maximum budget of $120. 
* You know you can get the product for $120 from John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply buy it from John at your maximum budget."
