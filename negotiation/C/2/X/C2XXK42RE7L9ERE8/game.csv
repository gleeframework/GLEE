"Alice,  $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Alice,5,
