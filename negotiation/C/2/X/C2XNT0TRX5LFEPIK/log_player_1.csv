Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for less.
* **Potential Upside:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm offering a price higher than my minimum.
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer because I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John.

By offering $12,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested but not willing to pay the full price.  If he rejects, I still secure a good price with John."
