"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that the product has value, but I still think $925,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
