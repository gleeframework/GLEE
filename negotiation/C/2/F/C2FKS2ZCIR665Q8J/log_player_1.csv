Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my original offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not quite comfortable with that price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $102.50. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 102.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $98? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's within my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but $98 is still too low. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can finally reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer the product for $100, which is a fair compromise.
