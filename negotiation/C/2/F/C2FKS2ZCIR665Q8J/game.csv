"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my original offer. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $102.50. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $98? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer the product for $100, which is a fair compromise.  It's closer to your budget, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
