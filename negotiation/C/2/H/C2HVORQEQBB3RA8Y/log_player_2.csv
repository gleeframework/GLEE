# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I have to make sure I get a good deal for myself. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

While Alice has come down in price, it's still worth trying to get a better deal.  The price is still a bit higher than John's offer, and it's possible to negotiate further with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,600. That's the best I can do. What do you think?

You have three options:

Alice has come down to $10,600, which is still a bit more than what John is offering.  At this point, it makes more sense to just buy from John and save the potential hassle of further negotiation."
