"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I have to make sure I get a good deal for myself. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  How about we split the difference at $10,400? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",10400.0,Bob,4,
