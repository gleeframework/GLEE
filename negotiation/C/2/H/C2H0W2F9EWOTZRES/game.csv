"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $800,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
