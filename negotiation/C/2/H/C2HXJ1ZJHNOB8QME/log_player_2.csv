"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum, leaving room for negotiation while securing a considerable saving. This counteroffer also shows Bob's serious interest while demonstrating his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to invest a bit less, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a gap.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.  He still has 7 rounds left, giving him plenty of time to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price, but he's also showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward. He's still aiming for a significant saving while demonstrating he's actively trying to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice's offer is only $87,500 higher than his last counteroffer.  Considering he has only 5 rounds left, accepting ensures he gets the product and saves a considerable amount compared to buying from John.  He can always try to get a better deal with John later if the opportunity arises."
