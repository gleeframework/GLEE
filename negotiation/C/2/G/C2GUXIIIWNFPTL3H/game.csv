"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to save some money.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $11,250? That way, we both get a fair deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go above $10,500. I think that's a fair price for the product. I'd like to reiterate that I'm interested in buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
