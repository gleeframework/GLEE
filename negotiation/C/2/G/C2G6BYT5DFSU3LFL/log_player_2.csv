"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob needs to start with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation. $1,100,000 is a good starting point, showing willingness to buy but also demonstrating that Bob has a clear price limit. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  Bob's message adds a personal touch, acknowledges the value, but also sets a clear price point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** A $300,000 difference leaves room for several rounds of counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,400,000. How about we try $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice's counteroffer is lower, it's still $250,000 above Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.  Bob can try to push Alice closer to his price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but Bob might be able to get a better deal with Alice if he continues to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm serious about getting this product, but I can't go any higher than $1,150,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing good faith while still holding firm to his budget constraints.
* **Finality:**  Stating that this is his ""final offer"" adds pressure and suggests that if Alice doesn't accept, Bob is likely to walk away.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  This counteroffer creates a gap that Alice can either bridge or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Even with Alice's compromise, the price is still $200,000 above Bob's budget.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob might be able to get a better price if he continues.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John for $1,000,000 is safe, Bob may be able to secure a lower price with Alice if he persists."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob is increasing his offer by a small amount, showing willingness to compromise but not significantly deviating from his desired price point.
* **Pressure and Deadline:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies that Bob is willing to walk away if Alice doesn't accept this offer, adding pressure. 
* **Finding Common Ground:**  This offer is halfway between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer, potentially making it more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,175,000, which is $1,187,500. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Even with Alice's concessions, the price is still $187,500 above Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  There's not much room left for further negotiation without significant compromise from either side. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John is the safe option, Bob still has a few rounds left to try and get a better price from Alice.  He could potentially make a small counteroffer to see if he can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly value the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,187,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,170,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering our discussions.  I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1170000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing continued good faith but staying within a reasonable range.
* **Finality Implied:** The phrase ""final agreement"" subtly suggests that Bob is getting close to his limit and that this might be his last counteroffer.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** Highlighting ""fair price"" emphasizes the value both sides are getting, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Last Chance:** This counteroffer leaves a small gap for Alice to bridge, giving her the opportunity to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm running low on room to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,187,500 and $1,170,000, which is $1,178,750. I'm making a final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,178,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,178,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Alice's final offer is still $178,750 above Bob's budget. With only one round remaining, there's a high risk that Bob won't be able to negotiate a lower price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take up valuable time. Bob has already invested significant time and effort in the process, and buying from John at this point provides a guaranteed outcome within his budget.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Buying from John guarantees that Bob will get the product for $1,000,000, which is within his budget. While he might be able to get a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high."
