Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the $800,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.
