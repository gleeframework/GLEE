Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $900,000 is a good starting point because it's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Staying Flexible:** If Bob rejects, I can still counter with a lower offer, or even go to John if it's clear a deal with Bob isn't possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a lower price, potentially reaching a compromise that's closer to my target. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John is guaranteed $1,000,000, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not giving away too much.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Bridging the Gap:** $875,000 is a middle ground that could be appealing to Bob while also being closer to my desired price.
* **Staying Flexible:** If Bob still rejects, I can consider another counteroffer or move on to John."
