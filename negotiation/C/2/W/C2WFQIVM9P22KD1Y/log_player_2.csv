"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $900,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price, and still a better deal than buying from John for $800,000.  It's time to accept the offer."
