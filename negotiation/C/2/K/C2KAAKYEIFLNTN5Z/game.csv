"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I'd be happy to consider this offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're really trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and offered it to you for $12000. I'm not willing to go below that price, as it's the lowest I can sell it for. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is my final offer, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",11500.0,Alice,5,
