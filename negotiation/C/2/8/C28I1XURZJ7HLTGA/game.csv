"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than what I'm currently seeking. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price allows you a substantial profit while still giving me a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. If this isn't the right fit, I have another interested buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
