"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($900,000)** is lower than what you're willing to pay from John ($1,500,000).
* It's also higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation, but you're still getting a good deal.
* **Accepting the offer** allows you to save $600,000 compared to buying from John."
