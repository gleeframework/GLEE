"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, there's no immediate gain in accepting. Bob should attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range.  This establishes a clear negotiating position and signals Bob's willingness to compromise. This also leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $15,000 to $14,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, this price is within his budget and represents a $1,000 saving compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further rounds of negotiation, reducing the risk of a stalemate or John's offer becoming unavailable."
