Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a premium price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I'd love to secure the $1,500,000 right away, I'm not willing to settle for the minimum. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm coming down a bit, but still aiming for a good profit. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous offer.  It's getting closer to my desired price point, and I'm happy to secure a sale that's still above my minimum. I'm confident I can find a buyer for $1,500,000 if needed, so it's worth accepting this offer and moving on."
