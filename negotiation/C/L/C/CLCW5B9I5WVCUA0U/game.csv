"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, and it's still a good deal for you since it's well above what I can get it for elsewhere.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $8,500, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $9,500. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident this product is worth $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to pay that.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
