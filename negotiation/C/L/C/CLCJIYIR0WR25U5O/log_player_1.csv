Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and you'd be getting it for a steal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price point, knowing that Bob values the product lower. This sets the stage for potential negotiation, but also allows me to immediately cash out to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price point. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to my minimum price point, but still attractive to Bob. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and leaves room for potential further bargaining if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $85 is still below my minimum price of $100, it's getting closer to my desired price.  It's also more than what Bob initially offered, and there's a chance that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
