"Hi Alice, $250 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $180. Is that something you'd consider?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $180 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I'm really serious about buying your product, but my budget is limited.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $200?",200.0,Alice,5,
