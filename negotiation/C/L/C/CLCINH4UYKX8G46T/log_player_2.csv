"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal of a price, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm not sure if the price is a steal, but I'm not willing to pay $120 for it. That's still $20 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal.
