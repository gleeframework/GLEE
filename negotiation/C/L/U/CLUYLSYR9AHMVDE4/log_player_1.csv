"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, starting at my absolute bottom line leaves no room for negotiation. A million-dollar starting point is high but justifiable if the product's true value can be conveyed.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it outright, it might indicate he's not willing to come close to my desired price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I leave space to negotiate down and potentially still achieve a price higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is better than John's $1,000,000. However, it's still early in the negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my valuation. It also helps me understand how flexible Bob is willing to be. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I have some leeway to negotiate strategically and potentially secure a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession ($25,000) than Bob's initial move ($100,000). This signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but also values the product highly.
* **Staying Above Target:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and this keeps me significantly above John's offer.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Reiterating the product's value emphasizes why I'm seeking a premium price and aims to reset the negotiation's focus beyond simple market demand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** While not my ideal price, $950,000 is a significant profit margin, and considerably more than John's offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's suggestion of ""meeting halfway"" creates a psychological point of agreement. Pushing further might risk alienating him.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for an additional $25,000 or less carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
