,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price John is offering it to me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $95?  This would be a fair compromise and still a great deal for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
