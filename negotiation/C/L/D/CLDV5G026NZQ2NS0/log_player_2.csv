"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is likely much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and provides a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also providing a good margin for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price.  I'm still comfortable rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,175,000 is still outside my target price range.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1,100,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and I'm getting closer to my target price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise. It saves me $375,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that Alice would not budge further."
