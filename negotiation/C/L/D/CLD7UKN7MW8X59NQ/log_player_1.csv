"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me while giving you a fair return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to the right buyer is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the potential in this product, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal - I'm willing to offer $875,000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and moving in the right direction.  Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a potential deal.  By stating this is our final offer, we're applying a bit of pressure while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this deal work, I need to come in at a lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $880,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make the purchase without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, Bob has steadily increased his offer and we're now significantly above John's $800,000 backup. Accepting at $880,000 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
