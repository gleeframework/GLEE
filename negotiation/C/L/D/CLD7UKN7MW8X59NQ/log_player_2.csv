"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me while giving you a fair return."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to the right buyer is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's also worth noting that Bob has several rounds left and still has the option to purchase from John if he doesn't reach a satisfactory deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I see the potential in this product, $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal - I'm willing to offer $875,000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit further, the offer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and has made counteroffers.  Rejecting this offer gives him another chance to push for a lower price and may encourage Alice to make further concessions, especially since she has declared it her final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this deal work, I need to come in at a lower price point.  I'm willing to offer $880,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make the purchase without going over my budget."", ""product_price"": 880000}
