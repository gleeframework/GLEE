Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree it's a good product,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  I could do $12,000, and that's really pushing it for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems pretty firm on staying near her last offer of $13,500.  While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely she'll meet my needs at this point. It's not worth the risk of going over budget or dragging this out further. John's offer of $8,000 is a guaranteed win."
