"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,150,000 is still above your desired price point.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so rejecting gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  John's price is your absolute limit, so you want to explore all other options first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling point."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive, but within reason.**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire to negotiate. However, it's still above Alice's minimum, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Focuses on fairness.** The message highlights the value to both parties, emphasizing that the counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation.** This counteroffer is a starting point for a more nuanced discussion and potential compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target.**  While $1,100,000 is better than her previous offer, it's still outside your preferred price range.
* **More room for negotiation.** You have multiple rounds remaining, so there's still time to push for a lower price. 
* **John remains a fallback option.** While John's price is higher, it's still available if you can't reach a more favorable agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $1,075,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. It offers a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current one.
* **Reiterating the win-win:**  The message emphasizes that this price would be mutually beneficial, encouraging Alice to consider it as a fair solution.
* **Building momentum:** By presenting a concrete alternative, you're keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
