"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $1,075,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a reasonable deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
