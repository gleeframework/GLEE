I'm starting with my ideal price. Since I know the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that. If he isn't, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $12,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer Bob $14,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above his initial offer and closer to what I want.  Hopefully, this will make a compromise seem more possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk going back and forth any longer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's the best deal for me right now."
