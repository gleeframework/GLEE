"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his own valuation as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing that he is serious about negotiating. This price also leaves some room for Alice to counter if she needs to, while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still a gap between Alice's price and Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to potentially achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing that he is willing to negotiate. $10,750 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This gives Alice a small incentive to accept, while still saving Bob a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,250 is a decent price, it's still above his ideal valuation of $10,500 and not as good as his initial offer. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time by a smaller margin. He's showing Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway.  This price is also a good compromise, as it's closer to Alice's previous offer and saves Bob a significant amount compared to John's offer."
