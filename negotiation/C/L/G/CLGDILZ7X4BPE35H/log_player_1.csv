Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I still think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $9,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher, so I'll take the deal."
