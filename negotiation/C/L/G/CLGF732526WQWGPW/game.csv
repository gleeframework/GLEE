"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget allows me to only spend up to $12000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $18000. It's still a great deal considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
