"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, and still leaves me some profit.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",101.0,Alice,5,
