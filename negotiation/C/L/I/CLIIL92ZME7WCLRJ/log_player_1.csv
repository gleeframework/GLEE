"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum. This creates some room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, and still leaves me some profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 101} 
```"
