"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $13,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It seems we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now. I can see that you're willing to pay a good price for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $15,250. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,7,
