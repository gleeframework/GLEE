"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree there's potential, that price point is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but that's still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be honest, anything above $800,000 is really pushing my limits. I could go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute best.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 just doesn't reflect the real value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm offering a final price of $1,250,000.  This allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
