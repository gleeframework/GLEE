Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree there's potential, that price point is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but that's still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be honest, anything above $800,000 is really pushing my limits. I could go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute best."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 just doesn't reflect the real value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm offering a final price of $1,250,000.  This allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is not budging much from her initial offers.  It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes sense for you within the remaining rounds. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is your upper limit.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal than risk walking away with nothing."
