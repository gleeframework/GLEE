"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. My asking price is $2,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, well above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone builds rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't go into specifics, hinting at the product's potential  might make Bob consider its value more than just his initial assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree there's potential, that price point is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, but we need to find a middle ground.  There are still 8 rounds to negotiate.
* **Sell to John as a Safety Net:** While I want to maximize profit, selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a viable option. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,700,000. This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** I'm lowering the price by $300,000 from my initial offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still remaining well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob of its potential benefits. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  $1,700,000 represents a reasonable compromise, especially given that I have a safety net with John's offer.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but that's still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be honest, anything above $800,000 is really pushing my limits. I could go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute best. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer, $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Significant Gap Remains:**  There's a sizable gap between our positions. However, with 6 rounds remaining, there's time to negotiate further.
* **Sell to John as a Backup:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a safe option if we can't reach an agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired range, aiming to bridge the gap and find a mutually acceptable price.  I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer to avoid reaching a stalemate and ensure a profitable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 just doesn't reflect the real value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm offering a final price of $1,250,000.  This allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Compromise:** I'm reducing my offer again, but this time by a larger amount ($450,000). This shows a strong commitment to making a deal while still maintaining a profit. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,250,000 is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to compromise.
* **Finality:**  Calling this a ""final price"" adds a sense of urgency and might incentivize Bob to accept the offer.
* **Emphasize Value and Deal:** The message highlights the ""good deal"" Bob would get and reminds him of the product's true value.

**Next Steps:**  I'm pushing Bob to accept this offer, which is still quite high for him but allows me to make a decent profit.  However, I'm aware of my backup option (selling to John) and am prepared to walk away if needed."
