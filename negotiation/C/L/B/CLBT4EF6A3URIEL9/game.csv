"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is too low for me to accept at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $135 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our needs.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $130 for your product. I believe this is a reasonable price for both parties.",130.0,Bob,6,
