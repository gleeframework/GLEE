Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the product's value, $19,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price.  To be honest, $12,000 is really my limit for this purchase.  If you can't do that, I might need to explore other options.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
It seems unlikely Bob will budge significantly from his $12,000 offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk Bob walking away."
