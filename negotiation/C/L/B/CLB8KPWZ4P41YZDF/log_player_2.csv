Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $85. It's getting close to my minimum price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, it's in your best interest to take that deal and maximize your savings."
