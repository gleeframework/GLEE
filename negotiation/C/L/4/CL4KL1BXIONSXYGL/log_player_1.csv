Bob's offer:

Round 4

We're still significantly above Bob's perceived value, and we have room to negotiate. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is our backup plan, but we can likely get a better deal from Bob."

Explanation:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, he's unlikely to reach our $1,000,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. His counteroffers are consistently splitting the difference, and we're running out of time. 

It's now more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the next 4 rounds."
