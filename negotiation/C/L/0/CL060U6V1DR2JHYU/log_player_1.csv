Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately hitting my floor price of $1,000,000.
* **Positive tone:** The message is positive and focuses on the value the product brings to Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not demanding a specific price and am open to discussion, signaling I'm willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to find a price point that's mutually beneficial while keeping my options open for a counteroffer or a sale to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my ideal outcome.  Since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, we both know this product's value is significantly higher. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** Starting the message by acknowledging Bob's offer shows respect and builds a more collaborative tone.
* **Highlight the product's value:**  I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob of its potential worth.
* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my absolute minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining my leverage.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes a win-win scenario, appealing to Bob's self-interest and encouraging a compromise. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices and hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 less than my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Final offer:** Bob explicitly states this is his final offer, indicating further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I prefer a higher price, the risk of further negotiations failing and being forced to sell to John for $1,000,000 is significant. 

Considering the limited potential for further gains and the risk of losing the deal entirely, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision."
