"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, we both know this product's value is significantly higher. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
