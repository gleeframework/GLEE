"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I think I can do a bit better than $102.50. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",108.0,Alice,5,,
