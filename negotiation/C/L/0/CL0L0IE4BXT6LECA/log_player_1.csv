"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:**  $175 is still within the realm of possibility for Bob, given he values the product at $100.  
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message sets the stage for a more collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, as he's shown interest in the product. 
* **Not selling to John yet:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, I'm willing to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $160, which I think is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not going too far below my minimum.
* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** $160 still allows me to earn a good profit, as the product is worth $150 to me.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and reasonable approach keeps the negotiation open and avoids a breakdown."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $160, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited time:** I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and time is running out.
* **No guarantee with John:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, there's no guarantee I'll be able to sell to him if I reject this offer. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my earnings while also closing the deal within the 10 rounds."
