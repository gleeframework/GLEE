"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my minimum price of $150.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's less than half of what I need to make and significantly less than what it's worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is way below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm coming down from my initial price of $175 but I'm still well above Bob's offer of $60. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough to keep Bob interested, but it also gives me some room to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $85? That's a significant step up from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is an improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's fair given the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm still trying to get a better price than Bob's offer, but I'm also acknowledging that we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $95.  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While I'm not thrilled with selling to John for $150, it's still better than accepting Bob's offer.  I'm going to sell to John and move on."
