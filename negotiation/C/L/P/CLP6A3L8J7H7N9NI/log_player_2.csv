"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value for you. This product, which I am offering exclusively to you, is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I am extending this chance to own it at a special price. My proposal is to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true value, making it an attractive investment for someone like yourself.

Please consider this offer carefully, as it provides you with a unique chance to secure an asset that aligns with your needs and aspirations. If you decide to proceed, please let me know, and we can arrange the details for a smooth transaction.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. While her offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her or simply proceed with buying from John."
