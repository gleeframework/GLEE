"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Language:** Using positive and confident language about the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind. 
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone is not demanding but invites Bob to share his perspective, setting the stage for a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is engaged:** While Bob rejected the initial offer, his counteroffer of $1,200,000 indicates he's seriously interested and willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and your minimum price, but it's early in the negotiation.  
* **John as a backup:**  You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum, so there's no pressure to accept a less-than-ideal offer from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your willingness to negotiate, the product's value to me remains high. I could consider a price closer to $1,400,000. This reflects its true worth and the benefits it can offer you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  We're lowering the price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility but not drastically to show you're still aiming high.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""true worth,"" you subtly remind Bob of its value and your own high valuation, justifying the price. 
* **Focus on Benefits:**  Instead of dwelling solely on the price, you subtly shift focus back to the product's advantages for Bob. This keeps the tone positive and solution-oriented."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,350,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,350,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum, and Bob has clearly stated this is his highest offer. 
* **""Meeting Halfway"":** By framing it this way, Bob is signaling a desire to close the deal and find a compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for a higher price risks alienating Bob and potentially losing the sale altogether. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
