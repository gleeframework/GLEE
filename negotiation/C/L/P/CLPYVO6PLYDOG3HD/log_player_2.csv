"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a potential deal. Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, but this initial offer leaves room for negotiation and avoids accepting a price that's too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. It's a good deal, and there's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the opportunity to purchase from Alice.  Buying from John would cost the same, so there's no advantage in switching sellers at this point."
