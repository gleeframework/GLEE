{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, close to my minimum value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential benefit to Bob, highlighting the discount as a key selling point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm framing it as a negotiation, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer. 

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with maintaining a potential deal with Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a price far below its value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price allows for a decent profit for you and stays within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to avoid selling to John at a lower profit,  I'm also not willing to accept such a large loss.  By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a significant discount from the product's true value.  This price offers a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but considerably lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** $1,200,000 still provides me with a substantial profit while allowing for potential negotiation. 
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good compromise"" aspect, making it clear that I'm open to a deal, but not at an unreasonable price. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go up to $1,050,000. This offer is closer to what I can afford and hopefully still allows you to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has come up in his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made significant concessions and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs.  Selling to John, even though it's not the ideal profit, guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially leading to a worse outcome."
