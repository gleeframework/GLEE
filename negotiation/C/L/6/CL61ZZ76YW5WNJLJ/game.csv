"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price allows for a decent profit for you and stays within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a significant discount from the product's true value.  This price offers a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go up to $1,050,000. This offer is closer to what I can afford and hopefully still allows you to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
