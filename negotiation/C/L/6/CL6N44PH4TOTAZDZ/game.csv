"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I still need to make a reasonable profit on the sale.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $875,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $860,000 for the product.  Let's close this deal!",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a reasonable profit on the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",870000.0,Alice,5,
