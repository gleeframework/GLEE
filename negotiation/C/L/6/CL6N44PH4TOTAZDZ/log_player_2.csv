"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in my best interest to try to negotiate a lower price. There's still plenty of room to negotiate and 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I still need to make a reasonable profit on the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $875,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $860,000 for the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a reasonable profit on the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $870,000, which is only $10,000 more than my last counteroffer.  Considering the remaining rounds and the fact that I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, this is a good deal. I'm saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
