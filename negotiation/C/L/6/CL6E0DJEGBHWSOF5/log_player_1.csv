Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be subjective, but based on my research, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to $10000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000.  This product is truly unique and I'm confident it's worth more than that.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $11,500. Would you be willing to go up to $11,400? This would be a good middle ground and allow us to finalize this deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 11400}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's tempting to accept, but I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $12,000. I want to see if I can get Bob to go just a little bit higher. I'll make one last counteroffer in the next round."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm only making $12,000 for the product, it's still more than I would receive if I accepted Bob's offer.  It's a shame we couldn't reach an agreement, but I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price just to close the deal."
