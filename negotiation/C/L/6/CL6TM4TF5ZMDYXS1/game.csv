"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  How about $125?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's valuable Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I could go up to $100.  That's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,6,
