"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $20,000 to someone with your needs. To give you a head start, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify going above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $18,000 is already a significant discount on what this product is worth. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but I also need to be fair to myself. This product is worth a lot to me, and $10,000 just doesn't reflect that value.  What if we try $12,500? That's my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,500.  I'm still a bit over budget, but I'm willing to go a little higher.  How about $11,500? It's a fair compromise that keeps us both in the game.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to accept a small compromise. How about $12,000, and we have a deal?",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $12,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,8,
