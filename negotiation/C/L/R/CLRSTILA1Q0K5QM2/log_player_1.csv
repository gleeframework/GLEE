Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $20,000 to someone with your needs. To give you a head start, I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify going above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $18,000 is already a significant discount on what this product is worth.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can spend on this product. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but I also need to be fair to myself. This product is worth a lot to me, and $10,000 just doesn't reflect that value.  What if we try $12,500? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,500.  I'm still a bit over budget, but I'm willing to go a little higher.  How about $11,500? It's a fair compromise that keeps us both in the game.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $12,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.

Bob is very unlikely to go above $11,500.  I've made significant concessions, and it's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
