"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Let's consider $1,550,000 – a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To make this happen, let's settle on $1,250,000.  This represents a significant discount on my initial asking price and ensures we both walk away feeling good about the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  While that price gets you the product, it's significantly more than your fallback option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and going with the guaranteed lower price is the best move."
