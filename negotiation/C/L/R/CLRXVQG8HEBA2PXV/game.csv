"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its true worth and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
