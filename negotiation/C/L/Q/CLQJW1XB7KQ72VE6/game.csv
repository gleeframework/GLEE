"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it, but that's my maximum offer. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. I think that's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
