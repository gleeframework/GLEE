Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $110. This is more than what it's worth to him, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to make a sale, I can't afford to accept $80 when the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $95.  This is still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and gives us some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a reasonable price, I'll sell the product to John for $100."
