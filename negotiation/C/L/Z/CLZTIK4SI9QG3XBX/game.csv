"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value to you, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This shows I'm serious about purchasing, but I can't go higher.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is a final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. If this doesn't work, I may need to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
