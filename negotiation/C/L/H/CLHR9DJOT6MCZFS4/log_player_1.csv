"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I want to explore getting more if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly the price John is willing to pay. While I would prefer to get a higher price, there's a risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
