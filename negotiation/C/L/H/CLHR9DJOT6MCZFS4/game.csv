"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
