"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick deal but also setting the stage for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and am interested. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is within my acceptable range and I want to secure the sale quickly.  While I could potentially get a bit more, the risk of further negotiation and Bob potentially walking away outweighs the potential gain of a few more dollars."
