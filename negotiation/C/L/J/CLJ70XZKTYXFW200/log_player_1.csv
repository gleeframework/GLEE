"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth more to me to keep negotiating with him, even though it's risky. I'm hoping he'll come up a bit in his next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about $700,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $700,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try to push for a higher number in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is still too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
