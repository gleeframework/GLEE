"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is still too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
