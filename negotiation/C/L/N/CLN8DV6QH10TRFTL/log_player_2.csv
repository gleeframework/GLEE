"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($10,000). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Bob wants to pay as little as possible.  $11,500 is a reasonable starting point, halfway between Alice's offer and the product's value to her.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to potentially make a small counteroffer, but it still allows Bob to potentially secure a good deal. 
* **Alternative:**  If Alice rejects this counteroffer, Bob can always go to John, but he's trying to avoid that if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $11,500 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $12,250?  That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $12,250 is a good price for Bob, significantly less than the $15,000 he would pay John. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, moving from $13,000 to $12,250.  
* **Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer and he might end up having to pay John's higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
