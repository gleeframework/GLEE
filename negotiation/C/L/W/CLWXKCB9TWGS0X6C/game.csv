"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
