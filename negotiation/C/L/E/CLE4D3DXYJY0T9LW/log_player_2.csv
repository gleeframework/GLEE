You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $95.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $90 is closer to your target, you can still try to get it lower.  It's worth seeing if you can push for $85 or a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $90 is closer, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about $87? I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $89 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhat in the middle while still ensuring a fair return for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $89 is a good compromise. It's within your budget and still allows you to save $11 compared to buying from John.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only waste time and potentially lead to a worse outcome."
