"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $800,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. He can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $750,000 is a decent price, he can likely still negotiate a better deal. He has more rounds to play with and there's no need to settle for the middle ground just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he'd prefer a lower price, $725,000 is a good deal considering the value of the product. There's a risk that if he rejects Alice's offer, she might not be willing to negotiate further. Moreover, with each round, the risk of buying the product from John for $1,000,000 increases.  It's best to accept a reasonable offer and save money rather than risking a worse outcome."
