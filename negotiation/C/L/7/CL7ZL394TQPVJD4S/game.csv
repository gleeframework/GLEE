"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,
