"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. However, I'm willing to make a concession to get the ball rolling. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still above his target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer.  I believe this price reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great value for this exceptional product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth and aligns with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still too high.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still committed to making this deal work, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can offer the product to you for $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated she won't go lower than $920,000. While this is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice may not budge further, and Bob will have wasted several rounds.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's target price of $800,000, it makes sense to buy from John and avoid any further risk or delay."
