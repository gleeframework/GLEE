Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This price is higher than my minimum threshold of $80, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer and a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but it also risks losing the sale entirely."
