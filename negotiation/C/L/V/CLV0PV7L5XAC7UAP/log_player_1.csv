{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm happy with $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $15,000 and my initial asking price of $20,000.  I think it's a fair price, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is still a good deal.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially since John is willing to pay $15,000.  It's better to secure the sale now."
