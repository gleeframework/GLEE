"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save money, but I have to consider the product's value to me. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get the price down to $875,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
