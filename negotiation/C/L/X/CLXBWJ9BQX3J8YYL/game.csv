"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I value your perspective.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $2,250,000 is simply too high for me. Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,600,000. It reflects a fair price for the product considering its potential.  I'm open to exploring further compromises, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
