"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. This is a one-time offer, so I'd love to hear back from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for significantly less from John ($800,000).  There's no point in spending more than you need to."
