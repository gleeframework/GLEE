"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that's a bit higher than what I think it's worth to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
