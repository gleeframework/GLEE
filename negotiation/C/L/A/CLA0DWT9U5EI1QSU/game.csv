"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I'm glad you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I need to consider my costs and the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than $1000000. I'm thinking of a price of $1150000. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate Alice's persistence, and I'm willing to meet her at $1100000, but I need some extras to make it worth my while. I'd like Alice to include a 2-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which would normally cost $50000. If Alice is willing to include these extras, I'll meet her at $1100000. Otherwise, I'm willing to walk away and explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to include the 2-year warranty and dedicated support package, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the added value. I'm willing to include these extras, but I'd like to increase the price to $1120000 to account for the additional costs. This is a one-time concession, and I'm not willing to go any higher. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1120000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to include the extras, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet her at $1080000, but I need to be firm on this price. I'm willing to walk away if Alice doesn't meet me at this price. I'm also willing to consider a small concession on the price if Alice is willing to throw in some additional extras, such as a free upgrade or a premium service package. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1080000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider the premium service package as an additional extra, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1080000. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000, and I'm willing to include the premium service package as a one-time offer. However, I need you to commit to the purchase now, as I'm getting close to considering alternative options. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1100000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1075000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to walk away if Alice doesn't meet me at this price. I'd like to finalize the deal at this price, and I'm willing to sign the contract now. If Alice is willing to meet me at $1075000, I'll accept the offer and close the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,10,
