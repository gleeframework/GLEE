"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I think that's a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your initial investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
