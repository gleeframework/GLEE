"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe a price of $1,250,000 is more reasonable. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While we appreciate your feedback, we must respectfully decline it. Our product retains significant value and we are unable to lower the price below $1,400,000. However, we would like to present a compromise that might be agreeable to both parties. How about considering $1,375,000 for the product?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thank you for your proposal. We've carefully considered your suggestion, and while we're open to negotiation, we're unable to accept $1,300,000. We believe the product's true value aligns closer to our initial offer of $1,400,000. However, to continue our discussion, how about we set the price at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
