"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profit above my minimum value of $8,000.  I'll see what Bob's reaction is before deciding if it's worth pursuing further with him or going with John's guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $8,000. While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is still above my minimum value and a good compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum value, and I'm running out of rounds. It's a good deal, and I'd rather lock in the sale than risk losing both Bob and John.  I'll accept and move on."
