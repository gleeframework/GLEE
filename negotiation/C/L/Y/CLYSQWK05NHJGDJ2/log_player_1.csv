Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's designed to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a high price. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
