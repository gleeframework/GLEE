Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000.  
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a price that's closer to my valuation but still attractive to Bob. I believe a counter-offer is likely, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B:** If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step closer to my valuation, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to give Bob another chance to increase his offer.
* **John as a safety net:** I still have John's offer of $15,000 as a backup, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It's a potential middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties.
* **Pushing for a better deal:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving up on getting closer to my ideal price. I believe that Bob, seeing my willingness to negotiate, might be inclined to increase his offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd like to receive.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that Bob might not be willing to increase his offer further, and we could be stuck in a back-and-forth negotiation that could drag on indefinitely.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** I'm guaranteed to make a good profit by selling to John for $15,000. This eliminates the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price. 

Given the risk and the guarantee of a higher price with John, selling to John is the most logical choice at this point."
