Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, maximizing potential profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $100 value, so Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's losing out. 
* **It's polite and friendly:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer $85 for it, as that aligns closer to my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a higher price. You can likely get closer to your target price of $95 by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price of $95. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
