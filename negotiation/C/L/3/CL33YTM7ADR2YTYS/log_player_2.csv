"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

We're getting closer to a good price!  Let's see if we can squeeze a little more out of Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to add a bit more to the price. How about $1,120,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we've made significant progress in lowering the price.  $1,120,000 is a good deal, and continuing to negotiate might not get us a much better price. It's worth accepting and closing the deal."
