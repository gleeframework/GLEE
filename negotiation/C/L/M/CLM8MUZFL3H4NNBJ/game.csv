"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $20,000.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I see the value you place on it, $9,000 is quite a bit below my initial asking price.  Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. Perhaps we could meet somewhere around $11,000?  That feels like a more reasonable compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $11,000 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to stretch to $12,000. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
