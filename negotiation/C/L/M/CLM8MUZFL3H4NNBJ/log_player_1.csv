Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I see the value you place on it, $9,000 is quite a bit below my initial asking price.  Could you consider something closer to $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
