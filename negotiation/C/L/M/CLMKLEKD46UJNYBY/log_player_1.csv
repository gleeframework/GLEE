{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $160 is better than $120 from John, but I think I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal.  I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer."
