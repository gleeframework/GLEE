Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers, you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for him to counter-offer.  You can then potentially negotiate down to a price that is still profitable for you (above $10,000).

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, knowing that John offers a guaranteed $10,000."
