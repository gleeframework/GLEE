"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $100,000 reduction from her initial offer is a strong starting point.  If she rejects this, I'll adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price considering my initial target was to save as much as possible.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, and I might end up paying more than $750,000.  It's also important to consider the time factor. Each round consumes time, and buying from John will cost me $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at this point secures a good deal within a reasonable timeframe."
