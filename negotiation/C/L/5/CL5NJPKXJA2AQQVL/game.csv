"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad we're having a discussion. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $19500, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",19500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $19500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $18500, but that's the maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at that price?",18500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to sell at $18500. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, but that's as close as I can get. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",19000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to make one last offer: $18500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000",18500.0,Bob,6,
