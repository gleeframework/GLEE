"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's already close to his target price with John, so rejecting this offer and counter-offering again makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is firm on her price of $1,200,000. Bob has already counter-offered twice, and it seems further negotiation won't get him a lower price.  Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it's the most financially sensible option for Bob at this point."
