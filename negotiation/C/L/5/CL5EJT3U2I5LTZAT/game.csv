"Alice, your product looks great, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
