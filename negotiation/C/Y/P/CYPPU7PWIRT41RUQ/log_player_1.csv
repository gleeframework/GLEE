Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
