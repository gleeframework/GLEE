"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **10 Rounds:**  I have 10 rounds to get a good price, so I'm not rushing to accept a low offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will pay $150 provides a safety net and helps me assess the risk of rejecting Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with more negotiation.
* **I have rounds to spare:**  I'm only on round 2 out of 10, so I have plenty of time to negotiate a better price. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $150,  I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if that's possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160 to try and make this work.  This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by dropping my price from $175 to $160. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Maintain Margin:** $160 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150, so I'm still getting a decent profit. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and find a price we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $140 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'd be happy to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150, but it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I'm still in early rounds, and I believe there's room for a higher offer from Bob. I don't want to settle too quickly.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is a safety net, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm going to counteroffer with a price slightly above John's offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $145.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Above John's Offer:**  By offering $145, I'm putting a bit more pressure on Bob, as he's only $5 away from my fallback option with John.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and emphasizing the benefits of closing the deal.
* **Final Offer Feeling:** I'm positioning this as a final offer, hoping to push Bob to accept. 
* **Assessing Risk:** I'm weighing the risk of losing a few more rounds against the potential of getting a slightly better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $135, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value, even though we are at round 6 out of 10.
* **Limited Potential:** While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident Bob is willing to go any higher.  
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed $150, which is a more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that I might end up with a lower price or lose time.  The reward of selling to John is a guaranteed profit at my minimum acceptable value."
