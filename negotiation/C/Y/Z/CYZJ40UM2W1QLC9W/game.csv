"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Would you be willing to accept that price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $95.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I think that's a fair price that's attractive to both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",87.5,Bob,6,
