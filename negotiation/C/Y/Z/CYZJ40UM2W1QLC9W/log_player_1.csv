"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts by being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product.  A price of $100 is a reasonable starting point,  giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for Alice.  It also leaves room for Alice to adjust the price in subsequent rounds based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $120.**  
* **There are still 8 rounds remaining.**  Alice has time to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals that she's not willing to settle for a price that undervalues her product. This sets the stage for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above her minimum threshold.**  $95 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer but still gives her a good profit.
* **Compromise is key.**  Alice demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by lowering her price, which could encourage Bob to be more flexible in the next round.
* **Reiterate the product's value.**  Reminding Bob about the product's value can strengthen Alice's position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $120.** 
* **There are still 6 rounds remaining.**  Alice has time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 

Alice can afford to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation. She's already demonstrated a willingness to compromise, but she shouldn't undervalue her product at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $95.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I think that's a fair price that's attractive to both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above her minimum threshold.** $92.50 gives her a good profit margin, but also shows flexibility to Bob.
* **Meeting halfway.**  Alice proposes splitting the difference, showing a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasis on fairness.**  Alice frames the price as fair for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $120.**  
* **There are only 4 rounds remaining.**  The negotiation is getting close to the end, and Alice needs to secure a profitable deal.  

With only 4 rounds left, Alice doesn't have much time to negotiate a higher price. Selling to John for $120 guarantees a good return, and minimizes the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
