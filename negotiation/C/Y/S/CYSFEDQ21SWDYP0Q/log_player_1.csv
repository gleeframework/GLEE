Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Minimum:** I have a minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $1,200,000.

By offering $1,400,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my potential profit:**  I am aiming to earn as much as possible while still making a significant gain over John's offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob has a $100,000 buffer between my offer and his maximum value, giving him some room to negotiate if he's inclined to do so.
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
