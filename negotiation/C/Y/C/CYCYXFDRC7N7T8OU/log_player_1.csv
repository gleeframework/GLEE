Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what it can do for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value (""value and potential"") to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" leaves room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Secure the highest possible price from Bob.
2. **Avoid a Stalemate:** The open-ended approach encourages dialogue and potentially a quicker sale. 
 
If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
