"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have a few more rounds left, so I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm feeling confident I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to this price, but I'm not going any lower.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 ensures I get a price above my minimum and I don't risk losing out completely by waiting for another round."
