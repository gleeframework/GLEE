"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000? I believe it's a fair price that still provides you with a good profit margin.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
