Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to both of us.  I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not comfortable going above this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still firm on $1,200,000. It's a fair price for the product, and I'm not comfortable going higher.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price, or I can explore other options.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Since John offers the same price, it makes sense to take the guaranteed sale and move on."
