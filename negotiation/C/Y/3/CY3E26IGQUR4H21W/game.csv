"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to both of us.  I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not comfortable going above this amount.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  This acknowledges the value it holds for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still firm on $1,200,000. It's a fair price for the product, and I'm not comfortable going higher.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price, or I can explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
