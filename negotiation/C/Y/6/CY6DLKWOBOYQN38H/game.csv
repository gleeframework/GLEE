"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $850000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this number.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we discuss a price of $725000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $725000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we discuss a price of $810000? It's a significant compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this number.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we discuss a price of $755000?",755000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $755000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot, though. How about we discuss a price of $825000? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we discuss a price of $765000?",765000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Bob, but $765000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm starting to think we're running out of room for negotiation. However, I'm willing to make a final push to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $820000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",820000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final push, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $820000. I've already gone as low as I can, so I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I think I'll have to look elsewhere for a better offer.",0.0,Bob,10,
