"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000, which is still well below its true value to you. Let's start our negotiation with this solid offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You have a clear goal to save as much money as possible, and buying from John is still a viable option, so there's no need to accept a price this high right away.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, while giving me a fair return.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,300,000 is still $300,000 more than your initial counteroffer. You can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to your desired price.  There's also still the option to buy from John, so you're not in a desperate position to accept a price you're not happy with."

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value this product holds for you. How about we meet halfway again? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,275,000. This offer is a good compromise and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to make this happen.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000. You're still aiming to save as much money as possible and can continue to negotiate for a lower price. Also, you still have the option of buying from John, so you're not pressured to accept this offer.  You can try to push for a price closer to your target by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer. While $1,260,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a fair return. I'm willing to come down to $1,265,000.  This price is a good compromise and allows us to close the deal. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,265,000. This is only $5,000 more than your last counteroffer of $1,260,000.  While you might be able to negotiate a little further, it's getting close to the end of the rounds. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price.  Additionally, there's a chance that Alice might not budge further and you could lose the opportunity. It's a good compromise, and a reasonable outcome for this negotiation."
