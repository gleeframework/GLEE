"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $950,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the potential for us to make a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is your target price, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to make a deal. Let me know what you think!

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $825,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price.  He should counter-offer again to see if he can get closer to his goal of $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $775,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $775,000 is still a good deal for him, as it's significantly lower than what he'd pay John.  While he could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and then he'll have to buy from John at a much higher price."
