"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's be realistic. $11,500 is still a bit low. How about we meet at $12,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",12000.0,Alice,5,
