"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm serious about buying it, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I can manage.  Would you consider $9,500? I really want this product and I believe this price is fair, given our previous discussions.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to go below my initial asking price. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
