"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested, $150 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $130? I'm hoping to get a good deal, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $130 is closer to my minimum, I think I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
