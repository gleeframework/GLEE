"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above what I'm able to pay.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant investment for me and is my final offer. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
