"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me.  Would you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $11,000? That would be a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
