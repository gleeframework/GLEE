"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $17,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, which is $15,000. Can you consider this as your final offer?",15000.0,Bob,6,
