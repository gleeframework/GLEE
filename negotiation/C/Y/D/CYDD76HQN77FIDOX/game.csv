"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of this product, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1700000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1550000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking more along the lines of $1625000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still firm on $1550000, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to explore other options.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least at $1600000. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can shake on this deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,7,
