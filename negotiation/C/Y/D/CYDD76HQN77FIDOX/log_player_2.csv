Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1550000 is a fair price for this product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,625,000

```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still firm on $1,550,000, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least at $1600000. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can shake on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While you've been able to negotiate a lower price, you only have a few rounds left. It's likely that the negotiations will continue to be tense and potentially lead to a stalemate.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price and avoids further negotiation."
