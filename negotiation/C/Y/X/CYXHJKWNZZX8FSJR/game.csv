"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $16000. I can do $18000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll love it, but I need to make a fair profit. Can you meet me at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $18000, but I'm not going any lower. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Can you really say no to this deal?",18000.0,Alice,7,
