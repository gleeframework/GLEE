Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still ensuring a profit above my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer ($120) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
