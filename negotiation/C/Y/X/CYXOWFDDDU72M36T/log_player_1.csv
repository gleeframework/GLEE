Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" suggests a willingness to discuss the price, making Bob feel more comfortable potentially countering your offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, leveraging the knowledge of John's guaranteed purchase as a safety net."
