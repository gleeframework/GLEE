Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he's shown interest in the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $875,000 is closer to what I want, I still believe I can get a better price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to bridge the gap a bit more."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate.  While Bob is willing to pay $850,000, I'm holding firm at $875,000.  We're both unwilling to budge.  Rather than risk losing this opportunity completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
