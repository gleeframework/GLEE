Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic deal for a product that will greatly benefit you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is keen on the product. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message doesn't mention John, keeping the focus on Bob as the primary buyer. This avoids pressuring Bob but ensures I have a strong fallback.

By setting a high initial price, I leave room to negotiate down towards Bob's valuation while still aiming for a significant profit."
