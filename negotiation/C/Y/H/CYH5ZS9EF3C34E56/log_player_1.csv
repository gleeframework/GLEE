"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a premium product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) and above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the value proposition of the product and its worth to Bob, rather than solely focusing on the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear I'm open to discussion, but I'm starting strong to establish my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired outcome. I can likely get closer to my goal with further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue to exert pressure and potentially achieve a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  While $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale, I want to see if I can maximize my profits by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm lowering my price, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the unique value of the product to reinforce its worth to Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable value. 
* **No Further Upside:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob backing out or me needing to sell to John, which would result in the same price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
