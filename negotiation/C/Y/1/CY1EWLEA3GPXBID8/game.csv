"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000? This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
