**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are getting very close to my absolute minimum. Accepting at $1,370,000 secures a significant profit above my fallback option of John ($1,200,000). It's better to take a sure win at this point than risk him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
