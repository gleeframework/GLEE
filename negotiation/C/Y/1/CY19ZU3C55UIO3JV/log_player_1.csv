Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  While I see its potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?
