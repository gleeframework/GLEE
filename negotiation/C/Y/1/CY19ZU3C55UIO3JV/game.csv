"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  While I see its potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,150,000, Bob. I can see that you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
