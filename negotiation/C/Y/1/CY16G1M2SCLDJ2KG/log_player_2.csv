With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting tough. While you can continue to counter offer, there's a risk of Alice becoming more stubborn, or you might not be able to reach a desirable price within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product now from John at $150, which is still within your budget."
