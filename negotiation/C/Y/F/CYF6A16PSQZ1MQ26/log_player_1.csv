Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. It's unlikely he'll accept the first offer without some back and forth. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, but still below my guaranteed price from John, I show Bob that I value the product while potentially securing a higher profit."
