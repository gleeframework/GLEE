Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your time and effort to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already found an alternative offer from John for $1,200,000, and I'm willing to take it if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. If you're willing to sell at this price, I'd be happy to do business with you. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.
