Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts by building rapport with Bob and then presents a price that's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, as we want to get the best price possible, but also keep Bob engaged and motivated to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $125 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  By rejecting the offer, you maintain your leverage and have the opportunity to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $112.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $106 is higher than John's offer of $100 and is close to our minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a sale at $106 than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's offer or even no sale at all."
