"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, and $130 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $75 is still pretty far off from what I need to get for this.  My final offer is $100.  It's a great price and a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
