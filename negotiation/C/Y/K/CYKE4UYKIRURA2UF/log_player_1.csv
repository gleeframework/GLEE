Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a slightly lower price than Bob's perceived value leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant gain for you.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** The offer significantly exceeds your minimum acceptable price ($12,000), ensuring a profitable outcome even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
