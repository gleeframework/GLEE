"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,250.  This feels like a good compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to get this deal done.",8250.0,Bob,4,
