It's a good starting point to try and negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good deal, but it's still possible to get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  If she rejects this, we can continue to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice has moved closer to my offer, and $850,000 is a good price, considering the time spent in negotiation and the possibility of getting it for even less. I'm willing to accept this offer."
