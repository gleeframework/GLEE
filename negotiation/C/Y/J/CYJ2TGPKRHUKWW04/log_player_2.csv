"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $950,000 is immediately out of the question. Buying from John for $800,000 is also not the best option at this point, as there's potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product while staying within Bob's budget. It's a bold opening that aims to get Alice to consider a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's still room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer allows for further exploration of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Bob is still trying to push the price down, but acknowledges that Alice is willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's initial offer and Alice's current price, showing a willingness to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has gotten closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high.  There's still some room to negotiate further, and rejecting the offer allows for another round of counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is now willing to meet Alice's price halfway, demonstrating a commitment to closing the deal.  This offer is close to Bob's maximum budget, but still leaves room for a potential counteroffer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget, and while $815,000 is still more than he'd like to pay, it's a relatively small difference from his target of $800,000.  Accepting this offer ensures the deal gets done without risking further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or losing the opportunity altogether."
