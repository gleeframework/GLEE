"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $115. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $115 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm still not willing to go below $125, as the product is worth a lot to me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125. How about we try $117.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",117.5,Alice,5,
