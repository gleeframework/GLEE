"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
