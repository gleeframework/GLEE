"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to signal that I'm serious about the negotiation but also unwilling to pay an unreasonable price. I'm better off countering with a much lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $17,000 is still too high. It seems like there's room to negotiate further. I'll counter with a lower offer, aiming to gradually bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
