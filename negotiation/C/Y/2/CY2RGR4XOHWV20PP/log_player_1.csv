Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While negotiating with Bob might lead to a slightly higher sale price, it's getting increasingly unlikely he'll meet the $15,000 threshold. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a safe and profitable outcome at this point.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
