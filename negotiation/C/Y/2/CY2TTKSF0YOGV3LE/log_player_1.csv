Round 2
Bob's offer:

Explanation:

Bob is very unlikely to go above his current offer of $1,600,000. Continuing the negotiation carries a significant risk of getting even less or reaching a stalemate. Since John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, it's strategically sound to cut losses and sell to John at this point."
