"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still leaves you with a good profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair compromise that still gives you a significant profit margin. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price that should benefit us both. I'm ready to close this deal if you are.",925000.0,Alice,5,
