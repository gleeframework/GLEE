Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer of $18,000, significantly above my minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will indicate his level of interest and potential price ceiling. If he accepts outright, great! If he negotiates, I can adjust accordingly. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John offers a guaranteed $12,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
