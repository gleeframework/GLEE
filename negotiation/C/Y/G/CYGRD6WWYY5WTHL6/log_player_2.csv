"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82.50? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with

You have three options:

While I could try to negotiate further, $82.50 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than John's offer and  Alice is unlikely to go much lower."
