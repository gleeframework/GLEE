"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I understand its worth to you is $800000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I value our potential partnership. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
