Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down, there's a good chance we'll land a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confidence:** Presenting the offer with confidence implies the product's value. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while still securing a sale above our minimum."
