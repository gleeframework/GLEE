Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price of $140 is below your ""walk-away"" price of $150 but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. This might make Bob perceive the offer as a better deal than it actually is."
