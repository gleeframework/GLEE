"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a lower price than you would elsewhere, and I get a quick sale without the hassle of searching for another buyer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  That would leave us both with a fair deal, and I could avoid the time and effort of finding another buyer.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so how about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
