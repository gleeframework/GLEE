# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $170 is too high."

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",

}
``` 

Let's see if Alice will accept our target price.  If not, we're close to John's price anyway."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our price, but we're only $15 away from John's offer.  Let's see if we can push Alice a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $135 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $125?  That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

We're pushing our luck a little, but it's worth a try. If she rejects this, we'll likely go with John's offer next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and $130 is still more than John's offer.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John at $120."
