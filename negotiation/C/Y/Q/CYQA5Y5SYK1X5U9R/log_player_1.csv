{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you'd be interested in! I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. But I'm keeping it within a reasonable range so he doesn't immediately reject the offer.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your budget, $75 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $80 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale rather than risk further negotiation."
