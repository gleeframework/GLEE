"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and I'm willing to make some concessions to get the sale done.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $95.
