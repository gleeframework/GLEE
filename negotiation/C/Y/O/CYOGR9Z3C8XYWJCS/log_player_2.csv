"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to spend up to $1,000,000, and Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000. This means you can get the product for the same price from John. It's not a good deal to accept Alice's offer because there's no benefit to buying from her. Therefore, you should reject the offer and buy from John."
