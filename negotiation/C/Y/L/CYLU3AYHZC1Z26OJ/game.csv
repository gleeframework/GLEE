"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 represents a significant discount already. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and leaves room for some profit on your end. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
