"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can live with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $1050000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $1020000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.
