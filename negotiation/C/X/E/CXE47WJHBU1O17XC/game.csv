"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  $110 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little hesitant at $107.  How about we split the difference again and go with $106?  Let's make this happen!",106.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. I think this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get it to you. How about we meet at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
