,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $160 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you consider $140?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. I can offer it to you for $152. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $152 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $146.  This is a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",146.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with $146. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for $154. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",154.0,Alice,7,
