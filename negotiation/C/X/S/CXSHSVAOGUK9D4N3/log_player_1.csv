"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this product to you. It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it could be a real game-changer for you.  Given its unique potential, I'm offering it for $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe strongly in the product's value.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Simply stating a high price isn't enough. The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as reflecting that worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum, leaving ample space for negotiation over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value.  While his counter was expected, accepting at this point would leave a lot of money on the table. You have plenty of room to negotiate and are better off seeing if you can bring him closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value it offers."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** It's good negotiating practice to acknowledge the other party's offer before countering, showing you're listening and willing to engage.
* **Standing Firm on Value:** While you're making a significant price reduction, you're still emphasizing the product's value and tying it to the price.
* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from your initial ask but still well above both your minimum and Bob's offer.  This signals willingness to negotiate but also establishes a firm position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  Would you consider $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum of $1,500,000.  You have the guaranteed option of selling to John at that price, so accepting anything less would be financially unwise. You still have room to negotiate, and it's worth seeing if Bob is willing to move closer to your acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about finding a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,275,000 is still below what I consider fair for this product. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,500,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Compromise:** Again, acknowledging Bob's attempts to find a middle ground helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer presents your absolute minimum acceptable price.  By framing it as your final offer, you're signaling that you're unwilling to go any lower.
* **Time Constraint:** By Round 5,  introducing a sense of urgency can be helpful.  While you have rounds remaining, this tactic might encourage Bob to take the offer more seriously rather than waiting to see how low you'll go."
