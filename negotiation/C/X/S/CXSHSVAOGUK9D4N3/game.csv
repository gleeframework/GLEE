"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value it offers.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about finding a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,275,000 is still below what I consider fair for this product. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,500,000?  This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
