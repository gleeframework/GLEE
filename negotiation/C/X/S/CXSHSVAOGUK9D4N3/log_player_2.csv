Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value it offers.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about finding a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,275,000 is still below what I consider fair for this product. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,500,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice is unlikely to go below her product's value to her ($1,500,000).  You've made good progress in the negotiation, but it's now time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,000,000."
