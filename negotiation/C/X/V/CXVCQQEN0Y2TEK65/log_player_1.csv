I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This is a tactic to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm rejecting it and will counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum. I hope to reach a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. I'm accepting the offer to finalize the deal."
