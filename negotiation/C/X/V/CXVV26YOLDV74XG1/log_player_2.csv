Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to selling and has consistently reduced her asking price.  While there's a chance to negotiate further, the difference now is only $50,000. Securing the deal at $1,300,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer and a reasonable compromise."
