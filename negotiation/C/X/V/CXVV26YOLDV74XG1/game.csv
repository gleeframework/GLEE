"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,350,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,250,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
