# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $90. You want to save money, so rejecting the offer is the best move for now.  You can try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $82. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $82 is still more than you are willing to pay.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $82 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $78? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $82 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you at $81. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You are very close to your target price of $80. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get Alice to drop her price just a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to making a decision.  $81 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to do $80?  That's my absolute limit, but I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
