"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $150, and she's offering it for $120. You can try to get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $115 is a good compromise. It's less than your initial offer of $105, but still better than buying from John for $150."
