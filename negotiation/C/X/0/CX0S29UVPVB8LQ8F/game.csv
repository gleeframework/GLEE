"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. While I see its value, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're continuing to discuss the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1,220,000. This is as low as I can go, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,220,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,180,000.  This is a fair offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get the best deal possible, and I'm determined to do the same. I'm willing to go up to $1,190,000.  This is a fair price that represents a significant compromise for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us and finally close this deal.",1190000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,190,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5% discount on the total price, which would bring it down to $1,169,500. This is my final offer.",1169500.0,Alice,9,
