"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that's still beneficial for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:** $875,000 is only $75,000 more than Bob's target of $800,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice has already come down significantly from her initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a longer process and a risk of Alice walking away.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject further offers, forcing Bob to buy from John for $800,000.  It's better to secure the product now at a price that's close to his target."
