"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still leaves you a good deal considering your value for the product and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
