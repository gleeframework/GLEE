Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. My counteroffer for the product would be $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  However, we're still quite a ways apart. I've reviewed the product's value proposition and I can come down to $1,950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my current budget and the value I can derive from the product, I propose we aim for a price closer to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for the highest possible price, and accepting now would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We're willing to push a bit further to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While your assessment of the product's value is a bit lower than mine, I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. Let's meet in the middle - $1,825,000. This reflects the significant value it offers while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's features and my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a price of $1,750,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the value offered by the product and what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now very close to our previous offer and well above John's standing offer. While we could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting at $1,750,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
