Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Appeal to Value:** I mention that Bob would ""really appreciate"" the product, hinting at its value to him. This is a subtle way to remind him of the $150 worth it holds to him.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While $90 is closer to my minimum price, there's still a decent margin for me to make more.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $80 is a safe bet, but I'm willing to risk further negotiation for a chance at a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by too much. 
* **Highlighting Fair Value:** I emphasize that $105 is ""fair"" for both of us, implying that I'm not just trying to squeeze him for the maximum price.
* **Building Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward with a realistic price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?  That's a pretty good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:**  $97 is only a few dollars away from my desired price point.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to counteroffer risks a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.
* **Secure Deal:**  $97 is a good deal considering my minimum price and the risk of further negotiation."
