It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you're already getting a decent discount from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a good price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired range. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or me needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer is the most prudent choice."
