{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows for some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value of $12,000. It also acknowledges the product's worth to Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$13,000 is still a bit low, and I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  How about we split the difference at $13,500?  This is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
