"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's a $2,000 gap between your desired price and her minimum.
* **John is a backup option.**  If negotiation with Alice fails, you can always buy from John, but it's better to try and save money first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  How about we split the difference at $13,500?  This is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price.**  She's moved from $14,000 to $13,500.
* **Splitting the difference is a fair compromise.** This is a common negotiating tactic, and it suggests Alice is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but it's more expensive.**  While John's price is always available, it's better to get a better deal if possible. 

I'm willing to accept Alice's offer of $13,500 as it's a good deal considering my budget and her initial asking price."
