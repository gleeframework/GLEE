Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's value while ensuring you don't scare him off. A good starting point is to identify a price that provides a significant profit for you while still offering Bob a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the substantial benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value. It frames the price as a ""fair deal.""
* **Product Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. Here's why:
    * **Your Profit:** You make a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
    * **Bob's Savings:** Bob saves $150,000 compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having John as a backup gives you negotiating power.
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If a long-term relationship is more important than maximizing profit on this single transaction, you might offer a slightly lower price. 
* **Market Factors:** If there are other potential buyers or factors influencing the product's value, adjust your strategy accordingly."
