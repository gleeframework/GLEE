Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,300,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob values the product for but leaves me room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a reflection of that value, not an arbitrary number."
