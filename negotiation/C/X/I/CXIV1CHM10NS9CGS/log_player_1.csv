"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about purchasing and gauge his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this price is attractive enough to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds are getting limited, and I don't want to miss out on a good opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise as it is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable value. However, I'm feeling the pressure with only 5 rounds left.  I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it's only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable value. With only four rounds left, I need to be realistic. I'm confident I can find a better deal elsewhere, but I don't want to risk missing out on a sale altogether.  This is a decent profit, and I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
