"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price considering its unique value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1800000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the unique value of the product and my willingness to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1500000 is your maximum, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I hope you can meet me halfway and make this deal happen.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
