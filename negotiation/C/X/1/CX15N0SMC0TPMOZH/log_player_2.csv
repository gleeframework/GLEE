Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value we believe the product holds and your budget considerations. We hope this offer aligns more closely with what you're looking for. Should you have any concerns or wish to discuss further, please let us know.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,100,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Alice is already coming down in price:**  The offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  There's a chance Alice might reject another counteroffer, forcing Bob to either pay more or buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 saves Bob money compared to John's price and allows him to secure the product."
