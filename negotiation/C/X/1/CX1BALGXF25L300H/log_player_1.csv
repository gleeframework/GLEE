Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $14,999 appears just slightly less than $15,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer might spark a negotiation, with Bob potentially countering with a higher offer that is still beneficial to you. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no immediate time constraints or pressing need to sell the product instantly. If you need to secure the $15,000 immediately, accepting John's offer is the safest course of action."
