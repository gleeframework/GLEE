"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1000000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential it holds for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still represents a good deal for you considering the potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $850000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up on your offer. While I value our negotiation, $850000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $875000. This offer is my final concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $825000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $825000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $850000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.  It's important to remember the potential this product holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $820000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",820000.0,Bob,8,
