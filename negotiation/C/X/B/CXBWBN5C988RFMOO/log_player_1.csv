Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The $18,000 offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me the chance to still get a price higher than $12,000.
* **Value Justification:**  The message vaguely implies the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and how much you know about Bob's potential interest, you could adjust the offer price."
