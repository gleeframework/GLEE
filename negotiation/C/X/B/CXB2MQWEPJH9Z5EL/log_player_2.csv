"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $7,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still potentially within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal, while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly better than her initial offer.  Bob can still potentially do better by continuing to negotiate.  Since Bob has 7 rounds left, it's worth continuing to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to close the gap with Alice while still trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise between the previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while maintaining a desire for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, and he has only 5 rounds left. It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, as there's no guarantee of a better deal in the future.  Accepting the offer at $8,900 secures a good deal while leaving room for some potential profit if Bob decides to resell the product."
