"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the unique value it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to counter.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
