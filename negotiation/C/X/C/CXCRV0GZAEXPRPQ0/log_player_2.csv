"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for a better price from John ($12,000). You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing the lower price."
