Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your true value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). However, it might entice him if he sees the product as having potential future value or if he highly values a quick and easy transaction. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and selling to John at $15,000. 
* Gauge Bob's interest and adjust your approach in future communications if needed."
