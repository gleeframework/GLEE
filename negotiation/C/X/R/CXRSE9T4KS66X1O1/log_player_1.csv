"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, giving me room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how he reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $1,000,000, as that would be a significant loss for me. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a significant profit for me.  I hope this will entice Bob to consider buying at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more and see if he'll budge in the next round. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to convince Bob that this is a fair offer and that it's in his best interest to close the deal now rather than risk losing the product altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired profit margin. It's risky to keep negotiating and risk losing him altogether. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum value and eliminates further negotiation."
