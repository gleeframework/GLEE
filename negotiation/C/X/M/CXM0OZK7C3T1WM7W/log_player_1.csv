Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strategic move. It's just below your guaranteed price, maximizing potential profit while still being appealing to Bob as it's just above his perceived value. 

**Why this is better than other options:**

* **Offering at $120 or higher:**  Bob will definitely reject this, as it's more than he values the product.
* **Offering at or below $100:** You're guaranteed to lose money compared to selling to John.
* **Offering between $101-$118:** While Bob might accept, you leave potential profit on the table.  

This offer balances maximizing profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept."
