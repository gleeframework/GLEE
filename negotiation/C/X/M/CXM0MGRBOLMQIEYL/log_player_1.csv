Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  This shows you're confident in the value of your product but you're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum desired profit margin. You're aiming to get as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. You have a chance to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is tempting, it's just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
