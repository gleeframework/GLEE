"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate. Alice's offer is getting closer to the maximum I'm willing to pay, but there's still room for me to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground.  It's a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but still a decent profit margin for her. By being direct and offering a specific number, I'm hoping to move the negotiation forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is tempting, it's just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and $11,000 represents a good price for me. It's better to accept this offer now than to risk her retracting it or reaching a stalemate."
