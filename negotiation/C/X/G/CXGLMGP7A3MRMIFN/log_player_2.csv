"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if a better price can be reached before resorting to John's $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so offering $750,000 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. This price is still within his budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price, but it is getting closer to her desired range. This approach allows Bob to test the waters and potentially get a better deal without risking too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $795,000 is very close to Bob's desired price range.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price but also increases the chance of failing to reach an agreement with Alice. 

At this point, Bob is getting a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risking further rounds and potentially missing out on the deal altogether."
