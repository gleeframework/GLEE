"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $900,000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, but still reasonable considering Bob's willingness to pay $1,000,000. Let's see how he reacts!"

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $750,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. I'll send a new offer that's higher than $750,000 but still lower than my minimum value of $800,000.

Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $825,000}
