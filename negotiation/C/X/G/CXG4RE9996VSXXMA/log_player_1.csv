Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below my bottom line. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob is stubbornly staying below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed $800,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
