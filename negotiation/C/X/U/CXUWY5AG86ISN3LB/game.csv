"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10000. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $10500 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $11750. I'm willing to make a final offer of $10000, and that's as low as I can go. I hope we can meet on this price.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,9,

"I've thought it over, and I'm still not willing to pay $11000. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think I'll look elsewhere for the product.",0.0,Bob,10,
