"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $775000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your desire to save some money. I believe this is a reasonable and mutually beneficial offer.",775000.0,Alice,3,
