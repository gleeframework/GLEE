"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. I think this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price. I'm going to have to stick to my offer of $95. This is a fair price and the best I can do. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to look elsewhere.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $100, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",100.0,Alice,7,
