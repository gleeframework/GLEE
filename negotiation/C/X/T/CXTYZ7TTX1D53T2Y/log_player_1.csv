{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for some negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to establish a rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $75 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $85? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $80 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get a bit more, $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for John's offer."
