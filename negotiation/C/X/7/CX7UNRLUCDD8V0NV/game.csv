"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. While $1,000,000 is a good price, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I don't think I can go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
