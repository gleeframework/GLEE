"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget though. I'm willing to offer $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but well above the halfway point between my maximum price and her initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation but signals I'm serious about a deal within a reasonable range.
* **Anchoring:** By anchoring my offer at $600,000, I'm trying to shift the negotiation downwards and make Alice consider prices closer to my desired range. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm ready to walk away if Alice is completely unreasonable. I have the option to buy from John at $800,000, which acts as my safety net."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer is better, but it's still significantly above your $800,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to move down by $200,000 suggests there's flexibility in her position.
* **John as Leverage:** You still have the option to buy from John, giving you leverage to continue negotiating for a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could do $700,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my seriousness about buying this product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Below Limit:** This offer keeps me well below my $800,000 limit, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing that it's a significant move on my part and indicating my strong interest in the product. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying significantly below her price and keeping my alternative option open, I maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However,  $700,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* **Above Budget:** Even with her compromise, the price of $950,000 is still significantly above your $800,000 maximum budget.
* **John is Safer:**  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at a price you know is within your budget. It eliminates the risk of further unsuccessful negotiation with Alice."
