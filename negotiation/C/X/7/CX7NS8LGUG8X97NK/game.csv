"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget though. I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could do $700,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my seriousness about buying this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However,  $700,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,5,
