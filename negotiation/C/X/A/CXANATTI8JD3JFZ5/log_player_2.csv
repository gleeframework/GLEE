Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1400000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  $1600000 is a good starting point, but I need to be at $1650000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds.  Let's make this deal happen.
