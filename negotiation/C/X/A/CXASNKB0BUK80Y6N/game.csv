"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  That's still a good profit for you and a fair deal for me.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $85 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $87.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $87.50 is still a little higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm happy to split the difference with you and offer $86.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $86 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $88. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal.",88.0,Alice,5,
