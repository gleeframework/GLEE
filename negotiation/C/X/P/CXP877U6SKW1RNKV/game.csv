"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also takes into account your budget concerns.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
