# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its industry and has the potential to revolutionize the way you do business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your organization. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  This product sounds interesting, but I'm going to need a lower price to make this work for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This establishes my intent to get a lower price.
* **Reasonable offer:** $10,000 is still within the budget but gives Alice room to compromise.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone will help keep the negotiation open and friendly."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also takes into account your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal. I believe there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time, showing that I'm taking her offer seriously but still have room to negotiate.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a good compromise:** While I'd still like to get the price down even further, Alice has demonstrated her limits.  $11,250 is a good price for the product and allows me to save $750 compared to buying from John. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We've gone through several rounds already, and the negotiation is getting close to the end.  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Alice getting stubborn or the deal falling through altogether."
