"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $20,000 is too high. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still a price that might be acceptable to her, considering the product is worth $15,000 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Even though he could potentially continue negotiating, it's better to buy the product from John for $15,000, ensuring he gets the best possible price within his budget."
