"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that I think is fair, given its potential benefits.  While I can't disclose the exact details just yet, I can assure you that it's worth at least $10000 to me. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further and I'll be happy to provide more information.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I don't want to pay $12,000 for the product if it's only worth $10,000 to her. I'll wait for more information or try to negotiate a better price.
