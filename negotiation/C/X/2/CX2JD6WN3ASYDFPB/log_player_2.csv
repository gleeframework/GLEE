"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's own valuation ($1,200,000 vs $1,000,000).**  This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a higher ceiling with John's offer ($1,500,000).**  You can use this as leverage to push Alice down in price. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.**  There's no reason to jump at the first offer when you have multiple rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:**  We're offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her valuation. This shows we're serious about negotiating but are also aware of her minimum.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to move up in price, so it's not a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  This price is below John's offer, which gives Alice incentive to accept rather than risk losing the sale to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's moved down a bit, it's not enough to make it a good deal for us. 
* **We have leverage:** We know John is willing to sell for $1,500,000, so we're in a strong position to continue negotiating.
* **It's early in the negotiation:** We still have many rounds left to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving incrementally:** We're increasing our offer by $50,000, demonstrating that we're willing to negotiate but not at Alice's pace.
* **Staying below John's offer:** This keeps John's offer a viable alternative, putting pressure on Alice.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer gauges Alice's willingness to move closer to our desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but not close enough.** While her offer is lower than before, it's still a bit too high. 
* **We're still better off with John's offer.**  If we accept, we're saving less than we could by going with John.
* **The negotiation is progressing.** We're seeing signs of Alice's willingness to compromise, so it's worth continuing the conversation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** This offer is right in the middle of her last offer ($1,175,000) and our previous offer ($1,100,000). This shows we're committed to finding common ground.
* **Closing the gap:**  We're getting closer to our target price, and this move indicates we're serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Still leaving room for negotiation:** There's still a small gap between our offer and Alice's last offer, which allows for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  Her offer is only $12,500 higher than our last counteroffer. This shows she's serious about making a deal.
* **The price is getting more attractive:**  $1,162,500 is a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **The negotiation is nearing the end:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue pushing for a lower price. 
* **The potential gain is not significant:**  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal.

By accepting this offer, we secure a significant discount and ensure we get the product."
