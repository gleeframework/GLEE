Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. How does $1,400,000 sound?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,400,000 sets a strong anchor point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates you down.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes a collaborative approach to finding the right price, making Bob more receptive."
