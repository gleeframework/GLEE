"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's a steal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away. There's a chance you can negotiate a lower price. You have nothing to lose by making a counteroffer and seeing if Alice is willing to budge."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $10000 is a good price, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12000?  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still willing to pay less.  You've shown your willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility. By rejecting the offer, you keep the pressure on Alice to come down further. You're closer to a price you're comfortable with, but there's room for further negotiation."
