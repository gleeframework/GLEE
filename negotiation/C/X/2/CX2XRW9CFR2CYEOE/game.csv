"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $10000 is a good price, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12000?  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12000 is getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $11000?  Let's see if we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
