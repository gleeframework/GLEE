,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  Would you be open to a price closer to $9,000?  I'm very interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I believe this price is fair and allows for a smooth transaction. ",10250.0,Bob,4,
