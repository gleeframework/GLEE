Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and my willingness to negotiate while also highlighting the potential for Bob to get a good deal.

**Why this approach?** 

* **Negotiation:** It's a starting point for negotiation. Bob might counteroffer, and we can go back and forth to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  This price is high enough that I'm still comfortable with the deal even if Bob rejects it and I have to sell to John.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, especially if he values the product at $8,000. It increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer."
