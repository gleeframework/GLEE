"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a good deal, but you can potentially get it for even cheaper.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your offer, and $110 is a good price for you. It's still below your maximum budget of $150, and you've saved $10 from her initial offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation for potentially a few dollars more."
