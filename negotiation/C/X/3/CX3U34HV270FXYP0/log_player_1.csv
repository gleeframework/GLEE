Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price while still keeping the possibility of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'll see if I can get him to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I hope this will encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through two rounds of negotiation, and Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer.  I'm not willing to go lower, and I'm tired of negotiating. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for my minimum price."
