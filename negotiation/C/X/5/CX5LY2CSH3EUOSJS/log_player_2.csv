It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a potential to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer:

Alice's counteroffer is still above my target price.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.

Alice has come down to her minimum price.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  It's time to finalize the purchase."
