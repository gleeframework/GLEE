Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum of $80, and it's likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
