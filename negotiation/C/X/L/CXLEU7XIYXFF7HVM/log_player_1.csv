Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while also reflecting the product's high value to me. I want to see how Bob reacts and gauge his interest. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I can't accept a price that's significantly below the product's value to me.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll need to determine a price that is high enough to be appealing to Bob but also allows me to get a good return on my investment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This price is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this price will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, I'm still not comfortable accepting such a significant discount. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that is closer to my desired price point.  I need to find a balance between being flexible and ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm countering with $750,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer while still being above my floor price. I hope this will be a more appealing price for Bob while still ensuring a good return for me.  If he rejects this, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John to avoid risking a lower price in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have gone back and forth for a while, and while Bob is showing some willingness to increase his offer, we are still too far apart.  I'm not willing to risk going lower and lower, as I've already moved quite a bit from my initial offer.  John is a reliable buyer, and selling to him guarantees me a good price. I don't want to risk a further decline in offers and ultimately get a price that is too low."
