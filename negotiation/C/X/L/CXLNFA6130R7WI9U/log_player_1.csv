"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll adjust based on Bob's reaction, but I want to see if he's seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, Bob's immediate acceptance of that price suggests he might be willing to pay more. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to try a slightly lower counteroffer than my initial price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have time and haven't exhausted my options. I'm hoping to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer but lower than my initial price.  This should make it a more attractive option for him while still giving me a decent profit."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm selling to John. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm starting to run out of time. John's offer guarantees my minimum, and it's better to be safe than sorry."
