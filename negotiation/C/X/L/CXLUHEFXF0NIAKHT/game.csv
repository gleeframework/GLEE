"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
