"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 falls quite a bit short of what I have in mind. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,850,000? This takes into account your perspective while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we discuss this price?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
