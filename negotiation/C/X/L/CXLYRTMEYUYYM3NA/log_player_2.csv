Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 falls quite a bit short of what I have in mind. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,850,000? This takes into account your perspective while still reflecting the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.
