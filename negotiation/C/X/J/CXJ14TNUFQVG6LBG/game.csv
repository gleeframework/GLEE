,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that's closer to what I need and still represents a good value for you. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,250,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
