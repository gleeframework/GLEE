"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  It's also a price that is likely to be appealing to Bob, as it's significantly less than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $70 is too low for me.  It's below my minimum price of $80.  I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85.  This is still above my minimum price of $80, but it's a compromise to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also close enough to his offer that he may be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round. I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, so I'm going to be more aggressive in my negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm countering with $82. This is my final compromise. I'm getting closer to my minimum price and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious and finally accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $76. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $76
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob is still too low.  Selling to John for $80 is the best option at this point. It's my minimum price, and it guarantees me a sale.  I'm not willing to risk another round with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
