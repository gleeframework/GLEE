"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $100. If you're not able to do that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is the lowest I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to sell it to John.",115.0,Alice,7,
