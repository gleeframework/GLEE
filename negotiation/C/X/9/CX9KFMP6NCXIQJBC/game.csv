"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I think this price still offers you a great deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired value. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to be careful with my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest and appreciate you coming up to $875,000. However, I'm still a bit away from my desired price point. Would you be willing to consider $890,000? This would allow us to meet in the middle and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $900,000, which would be $887,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",887500.0,Bob,6,
