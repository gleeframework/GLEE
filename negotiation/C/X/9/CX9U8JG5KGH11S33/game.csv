"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a substantial price, but I believe it reflects the potential upside you could realize with this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
