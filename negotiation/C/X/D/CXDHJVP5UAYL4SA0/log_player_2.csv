"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  You should definitely negotiate.
