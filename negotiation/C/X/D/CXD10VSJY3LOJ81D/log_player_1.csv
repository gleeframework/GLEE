Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly is advantageous even if the final price is slightly less than $15,000, as it avoids potential delays with John. 

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for maximizing profit."
