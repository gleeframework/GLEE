Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, making it a tempting offer for Bob.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob, highlighting the potential for a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  The initial offer is close to my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Attract Bob:**  The offer is significantly lower than my minimum, incentivizing Bob to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:** I haven't dropped below my minimum, so I can still walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept a quick sale, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer, but still lower than my minimum. This allows me to continue negotiations while maintaining leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.  It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my minimum, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us.  I'm acknowledging Bob's initial offer while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I haven't dropped below my minimum, giving me room to negotiate further.
* **Show flexibility:**  Offering a higher price than Bob's initial offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Stay above my floor:**  By setting a price that is still above my minimum, I ensure that I don't settle for a price that is too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000. How about $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $825,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially considering that John is ready to purchase the product for $1,200,000. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and signal that I'm not desperate for a sale. This allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob doesn't meet my counteroffer, I can always sell to John and ensure a higher profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than his offer but lower than my desired price. This will show my willingness to negotiate while keeping my leverage intact."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $900,000, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's last offer.  It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my minimum, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $850,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $875,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially considering that John is ready to purchase the product for $1,200,000.  

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I can secure a much higher price and avoid further negotiation with Bob, which is unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome. It's a win-win situation as I get my desired price and John gets the product he wants."
