Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and keeps the pressure on Bob to counter.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:**  A $200,000 difference gives Bob some room to negotiate without me feeling pressured to immediately sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

This offer starts the negotiation in a way that:

* **Maximizes my potential earnings:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.
* **Gives Bob incentive to negotiate:**  He knows he can get a better deal, but he also has a reason to work with me.
* **Provides flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I have a Plan B with John and the power to counter-offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Potential:** While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the negotiation leverage. I can counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I can afford to wait and see if Bob is willing to come up in his offers.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000.  I'll try to find a compromise that feels fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This would give you a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counter-offer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** The message highlights the benefit to Bob (a good deal) and the benefit to me (moving the sale forward).
* **Moderate Approach:**  This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving but doesn't completely concede to Bob's initial offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate and have other options.
* **Reach a middle ground:**  The counter-offer aims for a price that's reasonable for both parties, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal.
* **Keep John in mind:**  While $1,350,000 is less than my ideal, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to John's price, making it a more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,320,000 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Money:**  While I could continue negotiating, every round takes time and effort.  
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and that's a certainty I'm not willing to risk for a potentially smaller profit from Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the guaranteed deal with John offers a secure and valuable outcome.  It's time to move on and secure the sale."
