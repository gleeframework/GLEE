**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still not a price you're comfortable paying. Continuing to negotiate gives you a chance to potentially get even closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After reviewing your latest offer, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000 for the product. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality, unique features, and market value. We believe this is a fair price for both parties and hope it will facilitate a successful transaction.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget. You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like the negotiation isn't moving much closer to your desired price. Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees you the product at a price you're comfortable with and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
