"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product and my budget constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and it reflects the true value of the product. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still get a good deal on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
