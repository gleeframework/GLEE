Round 2
Bob's offer:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. How about $8,250?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. How about $8,000 even? That's my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not confident Bob will budge further.  I've already gone through several rounds and it's getting close to my limit.  John is a sure thing, so I'm going to sell to him."
