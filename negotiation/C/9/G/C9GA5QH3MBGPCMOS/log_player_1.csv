Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Leaving room for Bob to negotiate:** By offering the product at $150, I give Bob the opportunity to counter-offer. He might be happy to pay $150, or we could potentially settle on a price between $120 and $150. 
* **Considering John as a backup:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting the best possible price for the product."
