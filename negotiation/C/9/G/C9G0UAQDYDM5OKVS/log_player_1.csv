Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high, but be reasonable:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leave John as a backup:** John's offer of $100 provides a safety net. I won't accept anything less than that. 
* **Gauge Bob's reaction:**  His response to this initial offer will reveal how eager he is to buy and how I should proceed with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your desire for a lower price, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This is a very fair offer considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but hold firm:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Highlight value:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces the idea that my price is justified. 
* **Pressure to settle:** By proposing a ""meeting in the middle"" approach, I'm subtly nudging Bob towards a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $110 would be a fair price for the product. Could you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $110. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a $10 profit over John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away completely. It's time to accept the $110 and secure a reasonable profit."
