{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than my minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a significant discount from the value to Bob, which increases the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you given the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
