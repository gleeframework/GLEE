"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can likely do better. You know the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your value of $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down to $11500. This price allows for some flexibility on both sides, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair offer. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $11,500, which is closer to your desired price. However, you are still within your budget and have 7 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate might allow you to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11,500 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,500. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This price is still above my maximum, but demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11250. This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll see it as a fair value.  Let's seal this deal and make it work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is within your budget and a good price for the product.  While you could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you will be forced to buy from John.  It's better to accept this offer and close the deal."
