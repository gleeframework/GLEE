"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your value of $15000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 8 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to come down to $11,500. This price allows for some flexibility on both sides, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair offer. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11500 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10500. I'm willing to offer $11000. This price is still above my maximum, but demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left. I believe I can potentially secure a better offer from Bob, or if not, I can sell to John for a much higher price. I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum at this stage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,250. This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll see it as a fair value.  Let's seal this deal and make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
