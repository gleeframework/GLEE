"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still less than what I could sell it to someone else.  Let's try to make this work.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $150, which would be $135. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle at $142.50. I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.",142.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",140.0,Bob,6,
