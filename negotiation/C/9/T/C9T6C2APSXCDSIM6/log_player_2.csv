Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach an agreement. I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $9,100. It's a small difference, and it allows us to close the deal.  I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the difference between her offer ($9,100) and John's price ($10,000) is significant enough to accept. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result, and there's a risk Alice might increase her price again."
