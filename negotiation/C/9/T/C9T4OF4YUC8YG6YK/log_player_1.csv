Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and do $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go above $80. John offers a guaranteed $80, making it the safer and more profitable choice at this point."
