"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I've attached to this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900000 for it. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $900000.  Let's split the difference and go with $875000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
