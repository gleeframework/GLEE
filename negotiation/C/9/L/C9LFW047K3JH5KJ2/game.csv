"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,150,000.  This price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
