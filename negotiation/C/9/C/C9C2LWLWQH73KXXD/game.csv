"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
