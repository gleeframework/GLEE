"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm confident that this price is fair considering the value I'll be getting from the product. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your interest, $1400000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's continue to explore options.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counter with $1500000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
