"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still aiming for a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This would still leave a good margin for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
