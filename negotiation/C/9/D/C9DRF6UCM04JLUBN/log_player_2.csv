"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its inherent worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's limit.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's target of $1,200,000, but it's closer to his maximum acceptable price.  Since Bob doesn't want to risk losing the deal entirely, accepting the offer is the best course of action.  It's a good compromise that allows him to acquire the product while staying within a reasonable budget."
