"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
