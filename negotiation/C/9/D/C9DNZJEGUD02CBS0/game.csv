"Hi Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is unfortunately not feasible for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
