"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more than that to me. I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still above his budget, and he can get a better deal from John.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is unfortunately not feasible for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  $10,000 is still more than he's willing to pay, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
