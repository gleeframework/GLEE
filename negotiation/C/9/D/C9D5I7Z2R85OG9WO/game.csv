"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table.

"I appreciate your creative solution, Bob. I'm starting to feel that we're getting very close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting the best possible price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you at $1800000, but I need you to agree to a 6-month warranty and a priority support package, which will give you even more value than the 3-month warranty and dedicated support package I previously offered. Let's say I'll sell the product to you for $1800000, and you'll get the upgraded warranty and support package. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,9,
