Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of you.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Starting high gives you more leverage to negotiate down if Bob counters. 

However, the best strategy will depend on how confident you are about Bob's interest and your ability to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. By rejecting, you can potentially get a better price.  Here's why:

* **Counter-offer opportunity:** You can make a counter-offer closer to your initial price, potentially pushing Bob towards a more favorable deal.
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob you're serious about getting a fair price and encourages him to raise his offer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counter-offer to Bob. Consider these factors:

* **How badly do you want to sell to Bob?** If you're confident about his interest, a more aggressive counter-offer is acceptable.
* **How likely is he to walk away?** If you think he's likely to find a better deal elsewhere, be more flexible.

You can use the following template for your counter-offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to consider $_____. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": ____}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to consider $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, suggesting you're willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $12,000 is still well above your minimum of $10,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still space for Bob to come up a little, or for you to come down a bit, if needed.

This approach demonstrates a willingness to work towards a deal while maintaining your desired profit margin."
