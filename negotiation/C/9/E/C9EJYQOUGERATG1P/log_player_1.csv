Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
