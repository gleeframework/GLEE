"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This initial offer establishes my position as a seller who values the product highly. It sets a strong baseline for the negotiation. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net. This gives me more leverage to push for a higher price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's a clear attempt to get the product at a bargain price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I have John's offer as a backup, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation. This gives me an opportunity to explore if Bob is willing to increase his offer.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will help us find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This offer is closer to Bob's initial offer, indicating my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.  
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation active and prevent the deal from falling apart. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to bridge the gap."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental Increase:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a slight improvement over his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Pressure:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm subtly pressuring Bob to increase his offer. This might make him realize that he needs to be more competitive to secure the deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Remembering that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 at any moment provides me with confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."

{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his previous offer. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  Although this offer is below my desired range, it's still above John's offer, ensuring I get a better deal than selling to him. 
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  This counteroffer will gauge how seriously Bob is considering purchasing the product and whether he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Time is of the Essence:** With only five rounds left, it's crucial to push for a deal before the deadline.

Let's see if this offer is enough to convince Bob!"

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Near Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Two Rounds Remaining:** With only two rounds left, the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and not finding a better deal is high.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Considering the time constraint, accepting this offer seems like the best option to secure a sale. 
* **Balance of Risk and Reward:** While I would prefer a higher price, the potential of getting nothing in the remaining two rounds makes this offer a reasonable compromise. 

While I'm not thrilled about this price, it's a better outcome than potentially getting nothing in the last few rounds."
