**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than John's offer ($950,000 vs. $1,200,000). You can save a substantial amount of money by going with John. 

Alice's message is likely trying to inflate the perceived value to you. Focus on the numbers and your backup option."
