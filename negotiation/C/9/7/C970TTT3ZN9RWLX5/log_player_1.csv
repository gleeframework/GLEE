Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she needs to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at or below this price would be leaving money on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:** By starting at $1,150,000, Alice leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still staying above her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
