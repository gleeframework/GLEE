"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000 for this product.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still above your value and significantly less than my maximum price. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit too close for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This way, we both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
