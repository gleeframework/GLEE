"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000 for this product.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still above your value and significantly less than my maximum price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showcasing Bob's desire for a good deal. However, it's still above Alice's value, so there's a chance she'll accept.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message highlights that the deal is good for both parties, increasing the chances of Alice being receptive.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can continue to counteroffer, working his way towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit too close for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This way, we both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his previous counteroffer. This is a significant saving from Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even rejecting any further counteroffers.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
