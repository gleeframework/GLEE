"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $130 is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Alice likely expects some back and forth. By countering, I can try to get the price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still gives room for negotiation. This demonstrates my interest while making it clear I'm aiming for a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's a really good offer for a product you value at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating towards a more reasonable price.  $115 is a decent compromise. It's closer to my target, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk Alice raising the price again or reaching an impasse."
