"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that could be worth significantly more to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly.  I'm prepared to accept $1,350,000. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price for this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  I'm willing to meet you a little closer to the middle. How about $1,325,000?  This is a truly unique product with a lot of potential value for you. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'd like to propose $1,275,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $1,275,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value this product holds for you.  Let's finalize this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me and the fact that you're willing to sell it to me.",1280000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both getting close to our limits.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to accept $1,290,000.  This is the very best I can do, and I hope you'll agree.  Let's finalize this and get this product in your hands.",1290000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,290,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,285,000. I think that's the best I can do, and I hope you'll accept it.",1285000.0,Bob,10,
