Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and exclusivity, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and exclusivity,"" Alice provides a reason for the higher price, even if Bob isn't aware of the other potential buyer.
* **Open to Discussion:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation, keeping the door open for a deal.

**Important:** Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower her price slightly if Bob counters. However, she shouldn't go below $10,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer at that price."
