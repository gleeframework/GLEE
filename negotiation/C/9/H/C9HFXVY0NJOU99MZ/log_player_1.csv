Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You still have room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and you have the option to sell to John if negotiations fail. 

Let me know what Bob's response is so we can continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make on the product. While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob in case I can reach a price closer to my goal.  

I'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob, but I'll try to keep it close to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm offering $11,500 as my counteroffer for the following reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** This ensures I still get a decent profit. 
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** It's possible Bob might counteroffer again, but I'm ready to potentially compromise a little more if necessary.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low. I'm not quite ready to give up on negotiating with Bob, especially since there's a chance he might be willing to go a little higher.

I'll counteroffer once more, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product to you and my need to make a profit. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm offering $11,250 because:

* **It's a small compromise:** It's only $250 less than my previous offer, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **It's close to my desired price:** It's still above my minimum, but it's getting closer to what I'd like to get.
* **It emphasizes finality:** My message indicates that I'm ready to close the deal if Bob accepts.

Let's see if Bob is finally willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,800. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several compromises, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  

To ensure I get a fair price for my product, I'm going to sell it to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed profit, and I'm confident I made the right decision."
