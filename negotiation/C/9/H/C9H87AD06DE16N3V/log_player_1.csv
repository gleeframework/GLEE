Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its quality and features."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John,  it's always best to try and get a higher price. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $140 is a price that's still attractive to Bob (as it's less than his perceived value of $120) while also giving you a significant profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting a bit higher leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, bringing you closer to your minimum acceptable price."
