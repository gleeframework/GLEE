"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested,  $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to do $140?  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! Thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above what I'm willing to sell it for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. That's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with John.",150.0,Bob,4,
