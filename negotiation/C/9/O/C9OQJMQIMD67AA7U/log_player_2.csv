"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, accepting her offer is the best option.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation or spend the same amount on John's product."
