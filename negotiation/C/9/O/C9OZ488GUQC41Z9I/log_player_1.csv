"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay something close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer.  I believe this price point is fair and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $82 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a slightly better price. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87} 
```

I'm going to counter with $87. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price. I believe this price point is a good compromise and might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $84. Although it's still a bit below my minimum, it's a good deal for both of us, and there's a chance Bob might reject my counteroffer.  I'm not sure if I'll get a better price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
