"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in your product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also shows my willingness to meet you halfway.",11500.0,Alice,3,
