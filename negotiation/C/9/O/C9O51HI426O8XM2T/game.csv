"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of it.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm firm on $10500. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10750, which is closer to my budget and represents a good deal for both of us.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10750. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10900. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",10900.0,Alice,7,
