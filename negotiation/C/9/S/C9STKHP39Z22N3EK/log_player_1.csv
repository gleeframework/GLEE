"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $950,000 is far too low for me. I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not getting what the product is worth to me. I need to see if I can get a bit more from Bob before I consider selling to John.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so let's split the difference. How about $1,037,500? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1037500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've been through six rounds of negotiations with Bob and I'm getting closer to my minimum, but not there yet.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk running out of time and getting less than I'm willing to accept.  John is a guaranteed $1,200,000 and that's more important to me right now."
