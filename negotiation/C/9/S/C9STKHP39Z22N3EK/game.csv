"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so let's split the difference. How about $1,037,500? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
