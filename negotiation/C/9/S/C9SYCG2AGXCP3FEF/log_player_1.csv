"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, but not unreasonably so.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's important to remember that John is a backup option at $100, so I don't want to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $120 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is too low for me. While I could sell to John for $100, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's worth it for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm offering $100, which is my minimum price and what I can get from John. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not willing to settle for anything less."
