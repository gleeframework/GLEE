"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is above both your maximum price and her own valuation of the product.  It's highly likely you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $120 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($80), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a great deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial offer provides space for us to gradually increase our bid while staying well below our $100 limit. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly communicating our price expectation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's worth it for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Limit:** Alice's offer of $100 matches our maximum budget. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, especially since she's already at her valuation.
* **John's Price is the Same:** Buying from John would also cost us $100.

It makes sense to accept Alice's offer now, as we've reached the best possible price we could get from either seller."
