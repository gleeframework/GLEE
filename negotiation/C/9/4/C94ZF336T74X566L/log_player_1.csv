Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not sure if that's his best offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my last counteroffer, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get any closer to my initial asking price. It's better to take the $125 now rather than risk getting stuck with the $120 from John."
