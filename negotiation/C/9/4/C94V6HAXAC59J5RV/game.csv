"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,800,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. Please let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 represents the high end of the product's value, $800,000 undervalues it significantly. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
