"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll love the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is likely willing to go lower than $900,000 since her value for the product is $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still allows Alice to get a profit above her valuation of $800,000. This is a good deal for Bob, so it's best to accept the offer."
