Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer in this scenario:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 because John acts as a safety net.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he shouldn't logically pay more.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John, giving you a negotiation advantage.

**The Offer**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts. Offering the product at his maximum valuation is risky, as it leaves no room for him to perceive value and accept.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I've received significant interest from other parties."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to pique his interest.
* **Confident Price:** By stating your price with confidence, you subtly imply its justification. 
* **Urgency and Competition:**  The mention of ""limited-time"" and ""other parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages a faster decision.
* **Negotiation Buffer:**  The higher initial price allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, potentially leading to a final price above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, analytical), you might tailor your message accordingly.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a less aggressive starting price.

This offer balances maximizing profit with the probability of Bob accepting."
