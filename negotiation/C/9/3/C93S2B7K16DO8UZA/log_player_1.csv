"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which I believe reflects its fair market value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to gain a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000.  This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product. However, $1,250,000 remains below my acceptable threshold.  I'm willing to consider $1,350,000 as a final compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still trying to work within my budget.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,500,000, it's better to secure a deal now than risk losing Bob and having to deal with John who might offer a lower price in the future."
