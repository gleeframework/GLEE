"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible and is starting with a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Moderate offer:**  Offering $12,500 allows for potential compromise and doesn't immediately shut down negotiations.
* **Friendly tone:**  Keeping the message positive and polite can help maintain a good relationship and encourage Alice to be more agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I can do $13,500, which is my best offer so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Continuing to reject and counteroffer is a good strategy to see if Alice will come down further.
* **Avoiding John:**  While John's offer is still on the table, Bob is aiming for the best possible deal and should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is a good step, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** Bob acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate and reinforces a positive tone.
* **Gradual decrease:** The counteroffer is a smaller step down than the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Specific proposal:**  By suggesting a specific midpoint, Bob presents a concrete offer for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I can do $13,250, which is my next best offer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the goal:** Alice's offer of $13,250 is only $250 away from Bob's desired price of $13,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential for a better deal is limited.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John. 

Since Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, but also wants to avoid running out of time, accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this round."
