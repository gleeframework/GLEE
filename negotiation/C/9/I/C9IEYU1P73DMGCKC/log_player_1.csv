"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a steal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than $80, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
