"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still a reasonable markup from her own valuation. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message aims to be respectful and maintain a positive tone for continued negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  There's space to negotiate upwards towards Alice's desired price point while staying below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to Alice's desired price but still saves us $10 compared to John's offer.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, and we risk missing out on a decent deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to haggle might not be worth the potential savings, especially if our time is valuable."
