"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll get.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $8,500? This would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
