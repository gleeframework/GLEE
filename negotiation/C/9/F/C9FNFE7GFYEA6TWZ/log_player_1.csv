Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $102?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $98 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've only got 4 rounds left and I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher.  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is a safe and reasonable outcome."
