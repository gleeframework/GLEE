Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially get even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further""  signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob."
