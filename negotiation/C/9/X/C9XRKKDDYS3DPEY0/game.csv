"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How about we start with $12000? I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $12000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11250? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down.  $11250 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10750?  That's a fair compromise for us both, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for $11000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe this product will bring you significant value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again.  How about $10875?  It's just a small step closer to my ideal price, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your persistence, but $10875 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $10950? That's a small compromise on both our ends, and we can finally close this deal. ",10950.0,Alice,7,
