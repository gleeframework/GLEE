"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too far below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to me.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $10,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that price point work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
