"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and accepting would mean a substantial loss. While I'm aiming for the best price,  prolonging negotiations with such a gap might not be fruitful.
