"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm looking for something more reasonable. How about we discuss a price around $4000?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $4000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be reasonable. How about we discuss a price around $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a reasonable price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be within my budget. How about we discuss a price around $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $11000, which is $9500. How about we discuss a price around $9500?",9500.0,Bob,8,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $9000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
