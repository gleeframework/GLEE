"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth at least $800,000 to you.  I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  To make this deal even sweeter, I'm willing to let it go for a price slightly below its true value.  Let's talk about a price of $820,000. This gives you a great deal while still ensuring I get a fair price.  What do you say?",820000.0,Alice,1,
