"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be open to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1050000.0
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for you. I can see that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,1200000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product for that price. Considering the value you placed on it earlier at $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,7,,
