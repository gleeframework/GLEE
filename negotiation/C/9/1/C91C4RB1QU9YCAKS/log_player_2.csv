Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product for that price. Considering the value you placed on it earlier at $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

It seems Alice is not budging from her initial offer of $1,200,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better price. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is less ideal, but ensures I stay within my maximum budget."
