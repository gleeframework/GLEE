"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, giving me enough time to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,150,000? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling at $1,125,000. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $1,200,000. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,125,000, but it's still a bit below my bottom line. I'm confident the product will bring you significant value.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,162,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,140,000. This offers a fair deal for both of us and avoids unnecessary delays.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,140,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to sell at $1,140,000. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. There are still 4 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there at $1,140,000.
