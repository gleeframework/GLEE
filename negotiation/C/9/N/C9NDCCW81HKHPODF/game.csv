"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,150,000? This would give us both a fair deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to reach a deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,125,000, but it's still a bit below my bottom line. I'm confident the product will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,162,500? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy.",1162500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,162,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1,140,000. This offers a fair deal for both of us and avoids unnecessary delays. ",1140000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there at $1,140,000.  The product is worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a solution that works for both parties.  How about $1,150,000? This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and allows us to finally close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
