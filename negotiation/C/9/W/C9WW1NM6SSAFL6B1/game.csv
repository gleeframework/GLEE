"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit above my budget.  Could we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
