Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of her raising the price again. Buying from John guarantees the best price at this point."
