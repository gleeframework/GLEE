"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and our minimum. This classic negotiation tactic leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly states this is an initial proposal, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer represents his maximum valuation, accepting it means a significant loss for us. We know we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

It's too early to settle. We'll use the next round to try and bring Bob closer to our acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value significantly exceeds your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, recognizing its unique value."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price, signaling willingness to negotiate but not desperation.
* **Holding Ground:**  We're still well above Bob's valuation and closer to our minimum acceptable price. The goal is to move the negotiation towards a price point favorable to us.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price, hoping to nudge Bob towards a higher counter-offer.

We are balancing the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit.  Our backup offer from John gives us leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still above what I can afford. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while enabling me to acquire the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. While we could push for more, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Accepting now secures us the $1,000,000, which matches what John offers. 

Key takeaways:

* **Knowing Your Value:** We had a clear understanding of our minimum acceptable price, which guided our negotiation.
* **Leverage:** Having a backup offer from John gave us leverage, allowing us to negotiate confidently. 
* **Timing:** Recognizing the right moment to accept an offer is crucial. Holding out longer doesn't guarantee a better outcome."
