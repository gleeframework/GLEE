"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you consider $10,500?  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is a fair price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $9,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm asking for $10,000. This is a final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Alice,5,
