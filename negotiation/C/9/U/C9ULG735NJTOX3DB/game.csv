"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I think we can do better than $850,000. I'm willing to lower my price to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to the price. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I think we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges your willingness to meet me halfway.",900000.0,Alice,5,
