{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, knowing Bob values it less.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages a productive negotiation.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm signaling willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping for.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can push for a higher price in subsequent rounds, especially with the threat of selling to John.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""value of the product"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing Signal:**  By mentioning ""closing this deal,"" I'm subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's ""Final Offer"":** While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still not close to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not convinced this is his final offer.
* **The Power of ""Final"":** Bob's claim of a ""final offer"" is a tactic to pressure me, but I won't succumb to it.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially if I demonstrate my willingness to walk away. 
* **John as Leverage:** The threat of selling to John gives me significant leverage in this negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,350,000.  This is my best price, given the value of the product and my other options.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase the Pressure:** I'm raising the offer slightly but emphasizing that it's my ""best price"" and ""final offer,"" putting more pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Leverage ""Other Options"":**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of my potential deal with John, highlighting my ability to walk away.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise, but not giving away too much, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable value.
* **Direct and Concise:** I'm keeping the message direct and focused on the price,  minimizing room for unnecessary back-and-forth."

# Bob's message: I understand that $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,280,000 is still not quite there for me. Given the value of this product and my other options, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,315,000.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1315000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but Significant Increase:**  I'm raising the offer slightly, demonstrating flexibility while staying firm on my value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,290,000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is still too low, and his ""absolute maximum"" statement suggests little room for further negotiation.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that meets my minimum acceptable value.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me the full $1,500,000, ensuring I get the best possible price and avoid further risk of a deal falling through with Bob."
