I'm starting high, at $1,800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.  I'm not certain what Bob's valuation is, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a significant premium.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than $1,200,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to make sure I get closer to my desired price. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,500,000. This is a significant jump from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that is fair to both of us, and I believe this offer is a good starting point. I'm confident that we can reach a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I would prefer more, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for the same price.  It's time to secure the sale and move on."
