Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum value of $12,000, but it allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can make a counteroffer closer to my minimum. It also leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob, which I can then accept or reject based on how close it is to my desired price.  If I don't get a satisfactory price, I always have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is still lower than my minimum of $12,000, but it's getting close.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as I would rather get a good price now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for my minimum."
