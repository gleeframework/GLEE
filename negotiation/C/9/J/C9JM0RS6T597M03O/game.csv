"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a good profit on this deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum value, and I believe it still gives you a solid profit. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to make a significant profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good profit, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal and avoid going back and forth further.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,320,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
