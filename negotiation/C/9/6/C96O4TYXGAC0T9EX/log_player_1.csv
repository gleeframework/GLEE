Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, aiming to leave room for negotiation and hopefully maximize my profit. I'm confident in the product's worth and hoping to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm proposing $16,000. This is still above Bob's offer and closer to my initial price, but I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer. Considering that I can always sell to John for $12,000, accepting Bob's offer would be the best move to secure a slightly higher profit."
