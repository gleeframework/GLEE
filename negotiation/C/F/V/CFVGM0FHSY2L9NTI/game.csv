"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more than that to me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can do $12,000, but that's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a little too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to stay closer to my budget.  How about $13,000?  That's the best I can do.",13000.0,Bob,6,
