"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategic move to potentially maximize my profit.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit extra, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not yet ready to settle for less than $80, which is what I could get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $82.  This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering our back and forth, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll likely go with John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $79 is almost my minimum, I've had 5 rounds of negotiation and Bob seems unwilling to go higher. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80, which is my guaranteed minimum price."
