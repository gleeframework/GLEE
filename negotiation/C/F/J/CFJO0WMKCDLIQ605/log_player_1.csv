{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is more than your $10,000 floor, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  At $11,500, Bob still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust the price depending on Bob's response, without immediately going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  You have a chance to get a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 

You have leverage because:

* **John's offer:**  You can always sell to John for $10,000, so you're not desperate to accept Bob's offer.
* **Bob's interest:** Bob has stated he's interested in the product, which increases the likelihood he'll negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you are willing to negotiate but maintains a price above your minimum. 
* **Fairness:** The middle ground of $11,000  is a good compromise, suggesting you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **Clear message:** The message is direct and avoids unnecessary fluff, highlighting your willingness to compromise."
