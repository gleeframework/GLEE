"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your work, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially offering it for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is far too high, and Bob has a clear goal of spending no more than $8,000. It's much better to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing that."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is still a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial $22,000, $18,000 is still significantly over his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
