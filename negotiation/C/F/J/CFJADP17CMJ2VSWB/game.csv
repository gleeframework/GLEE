"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is still a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
