"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. The product's value is substantial, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional asset.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking $1000000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is sufficient for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1100000. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to a price that works for both of us. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1050000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that you're not valuing the product's true worth. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1150000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're confident in the product's value, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Please let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised by your offer of $900000, as I was expecting a more serious and competitive bid. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to get at least $1200000 to meet my minimum expectations. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $1050000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
