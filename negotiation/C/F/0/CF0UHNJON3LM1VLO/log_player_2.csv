You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. How about $120?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $90. This is my final offer, though - I've already had a better offer from someone else, and I need to consider that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to spend.  I know I can get the product from John for $80, which is my target price. It's time to cut my losses with Alice and go with the guaranteed better deal."
