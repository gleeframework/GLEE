"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would still allow you a substantial profit.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This price would give you a good profit margin while also saving me a significant amount of money.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both show a bit of flexibility.",975000.0,Bob,4,
