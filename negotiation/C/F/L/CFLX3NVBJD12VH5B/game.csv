,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This reflects a more reasonable compromise considering its true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still struggling to justify $1,050,000. Let's split the difference and meet at $975,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
