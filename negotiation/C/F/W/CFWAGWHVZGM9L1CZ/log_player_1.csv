Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet my $1,000,000 minimum.  At this point, the potential profit from continuing to negotiate with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed offer."
