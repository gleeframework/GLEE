Alice's starting price is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to a price that works for me."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While Alice is coming down, $14,000 is still above my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a little further, but I need to be mindful of John's offer."
