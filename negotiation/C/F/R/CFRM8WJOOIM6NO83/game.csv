"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $14000 is a good one, but I'm not quite ready to accept it just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
