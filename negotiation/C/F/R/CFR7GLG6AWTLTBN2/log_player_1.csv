Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:**  You know John will buy the product for $8,000, ensuring you won't make less than that.
* **Bob's valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $8,000. 
* **Aiming higher:** Starting with a price of $10,000 allows room for negotiation downward while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Firmness:**  Presenting it as a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer can make Bob more likely to accept, especially if he believes the product is worth the price to him.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about John's guaranteed offer. If Bob knows your minimum, he's unlikely to offer more than $8,000.
* This strategy involves risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed only $8,000 from John."
