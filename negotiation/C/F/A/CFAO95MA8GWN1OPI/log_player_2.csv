Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,025,000. This price allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still too far off from the value this product holds.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us, ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
