"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $950,000, which still reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable margin for both of us. I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,025,000. This price allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still too far off from the value this product holds.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us, ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
