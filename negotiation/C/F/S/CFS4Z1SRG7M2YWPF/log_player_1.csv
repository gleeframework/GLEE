"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undervalue the product.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking Bob what he thinks to encourage a dialogue and potentially avoid a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While I can sell to John for $80, I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob first.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** By offering $105, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I reiterate that I'm willing to work with Bob, suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Direct and clear:**  I'm being direct and clear with my counteroffer, avoiding any ambiguity.

**Next steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll continue to negotiate and adjust my offers accordingly. If he rejects again, I'll consider offering a price closer to $90 to avoid losing the sale altogether. I'll also keep the option of selling to John for $80 in mind as a fallback plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80 and only $5 away from Bob's offer, representing a reasonable compromise. 
* **Limited rounds:** We are already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further price reductions and potentially a deal worse than selling to John.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit of $15, which is better than the $0 profit I'd get if I sell to John or the potential for a lower price in future rounds. 

**Conclusion:**  

While I'd ideally like to secure a higher price, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation risk and secure a profit."
