"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800. Can we meet in the middle again?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9500. I'm willing to consider additional features or services that you can provide, and I'm willing to pay for them. Can we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
