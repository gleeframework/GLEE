"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I'm sure it will be a valuable asset for your business. My asking price is $1,400,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible and find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This price still provides you with a significant value proposition, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable return on my investment. Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $1,250,000. This price should be more reasonable for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal work at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your willingness to negotiate, and your offer is getting closer. However, $1,250,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and try $1,275,000. This price acknowledges the value you see in the product, while also enabling me to reach a more agreeable outcome. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,225,000? This price is a compromise, but it's the most I'm willing to pay.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement. While $1,225,000 is closer to what I need, it's still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,260,000. This price reflects the value you see in the product and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this deal happen.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,260,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying. How about $1,230,000? This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",1230000.0,Bob,8,
