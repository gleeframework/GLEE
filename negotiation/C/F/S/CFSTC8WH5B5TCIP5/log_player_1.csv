Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.
