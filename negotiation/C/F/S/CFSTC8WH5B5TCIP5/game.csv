"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment at that price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $9,000. How about we try $8,250? I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
