"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm getting a good price and you're getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if the price is right. I'd like to reject the offer.
