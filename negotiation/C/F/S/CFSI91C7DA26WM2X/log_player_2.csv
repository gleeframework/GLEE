"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to try to get a better deal.  You can always resort to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's  $2,000 below Alice's initial price. This is a significant discount, but still likely above Alice's minimum acceptable price point. This allows room for negotiation while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a favorable price."
