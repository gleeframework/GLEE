"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $11,500. This is a significant drop and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range. While he might be able to get a slightly lower price through further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price outweigh the potential benefit of a few more dollars saved. Accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 provides a good deal and avoids unnecessary risk."
