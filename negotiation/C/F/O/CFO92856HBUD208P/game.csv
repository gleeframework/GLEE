"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I can come down to $105.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is closer to what I'm able to spend. Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $95 isn't quite there yet. How about $100? That's my absolute minimum, but I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
