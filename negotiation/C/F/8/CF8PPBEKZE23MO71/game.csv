"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my maximum limit, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, considering the potential value of the product to me, and it's a significant step closer to your last offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price range. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle on $1,425,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,425,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to offer $1,350,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you've been a fair negotiator, and I respect that. Let's split the difference to close this deal today.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,387,500?",1387500.0,Alice,7,
