Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to get the highest price possible. Offering it slightly below my asking price to Bob leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond John's offer.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, but that doesn't reflect its potential future value to him. My offer prices it significantly lower than my minimum, but still high enough to potentially be enticing if he sees long-term value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions the product as high-value but potentially attainable for Bob. It creates a sense of urgency, as he knows I have other options if he declines. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be open to slight negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below a certain threshold since John's offer provides a strong fallback option."
