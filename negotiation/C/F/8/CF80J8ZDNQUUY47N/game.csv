"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle closer to the middle at $1,500,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
