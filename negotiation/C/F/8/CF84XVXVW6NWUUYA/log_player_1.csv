**Reasoning:**

While we're still above our $1,000,000 minimum, Bob is clearly trying to lowball us. Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds. It's always better to secure a good deal than to hold out for an ideal one that might never come."
