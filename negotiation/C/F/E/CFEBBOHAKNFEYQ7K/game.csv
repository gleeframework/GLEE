"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $14,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that I'm willing to consider, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $8,500. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $9,800? It's a fair price that I'm willing to consider, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9,800 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, if it's not acceptable, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
