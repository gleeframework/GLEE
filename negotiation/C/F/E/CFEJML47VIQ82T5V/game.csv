"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I am currently working within a budget that restricts me to a maximum of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to be flexible, so I'm proposing a revised price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
