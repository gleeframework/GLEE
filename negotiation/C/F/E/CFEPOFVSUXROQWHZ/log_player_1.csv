Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I find the price of $2,300,000 to be a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my end and reflects the maximum budget I have allocated for this acquisition. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value and allows me to make this important investment.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $1,550,000 is just a bit outside of what I had budgeted. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $1,400,000. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make this work.
