I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and what his budget might be.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to accept $600,000 for something worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. I want to show a willingness to negotiate, but also demonstrate the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price expectations. Even though I've lowered my offer considerably, his counteroffers keep getting lower.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a more reasonable amount."
