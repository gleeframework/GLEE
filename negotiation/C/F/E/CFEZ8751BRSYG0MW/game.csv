"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference:  $9500.  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
