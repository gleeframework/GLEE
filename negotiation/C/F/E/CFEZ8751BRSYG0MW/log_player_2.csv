"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he's not satisfied with the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference:  $9500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's likely Alice will not budge further.  Given that there are only 5 rounds remaining, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees him the product at his desired price and avoids further potential negotiations."
