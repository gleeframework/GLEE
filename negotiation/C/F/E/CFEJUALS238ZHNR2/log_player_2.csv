"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to let go of the product for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering I'm already paying more than what I'd get from John. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit too high for you, but $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $14,500 is tempting, it's still higher than Bob's maximum.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 and secure a deal that's within his budget."
