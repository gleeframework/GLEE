"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $1,200,000 limit and even more than her own valuation. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way beyond my budget for this.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  What can you do?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer. This gives us room to move upwards while staying well below our $1,200,000 limit.
* **Justification:** We're not just throwing out a random number. We're indicating our budget constraints and that we're serious buyers if the price is right.
* **Encouraging a Response:** The tone is polite but firm, encouraging Alice to counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $1,700,000 is still significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's important to signal that you're serious about a lower price point without walking away from the negotiation yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm able to spend. To make this work, I can go up to $1,100,000.  Let me know if that's within the realm of possibility."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:**  We're moving up from our initial offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but the increase is still significant.
* **Staying Below Limit:** This counteroffer keeps us comfortably below our $1,200,000 maximum and leaves room for some final adjustments. 
* **Directness:** The language is clear and concise, reiterating our budget limitations and aiming for a more decisive response from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,450,000, but that's my firm limit.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is signaling that $1,450,000 is her bottom line.  This is still above your $1,200,000 limit.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.

It makes the most financial sense to secure the product at the best available price from John."
