Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product for me. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
