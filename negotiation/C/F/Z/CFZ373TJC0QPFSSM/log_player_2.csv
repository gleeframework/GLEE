# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $95. I believe it's a great deal, as I know it holds significant value for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's cheaper than John, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. While $90 is better than $95, you're still only $10 away from your target price of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle at $87.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
