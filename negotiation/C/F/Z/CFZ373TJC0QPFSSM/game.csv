"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product for me. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price considering its value.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle at $87.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",87.5,Bob,4,
