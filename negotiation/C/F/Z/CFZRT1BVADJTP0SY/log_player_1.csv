Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's potential desire for a valuable asset. 
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" aims to create a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob pushes back on the price.  The goal is to find a price point that maximizes profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
