Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still quite high. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down closer to my budget before considering John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair price."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is getting closer, but I'm not in a rush. I'll try to push her a bit further down before accepting or going with John."
