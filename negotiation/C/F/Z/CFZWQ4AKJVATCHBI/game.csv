"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
