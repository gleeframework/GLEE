"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $100 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $200 is closer to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $125.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $160?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $160 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,6,
