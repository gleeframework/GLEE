"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product at this time, I assure you it's worth a substantial sum. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the product's inherent worth and potential for future growth. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I have another buyer lined up at a lower price, but I believe you'll recognize the exceptional value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, and she provides no information about the product's value.  You know John is willing to sell the same product for the same price.  Therefore, you are not gaining any advantage by buying from Alice, so rejecting her offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
