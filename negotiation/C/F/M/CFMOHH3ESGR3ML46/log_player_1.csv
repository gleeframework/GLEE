"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always beneficial to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, you're providing a reason for the high initial price, making it appear less arbitrary. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves significant room for Bob to negotiate downwards, while still keeping the potential sale price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and the product's value to him. While meeting ""halfway"" sounds appealing, it sets a weak precedent for the rest of the negotiation. You have room to negotiate, but accepting this low offer would be leaving a lot of money on the table.  You're better off countering to steer the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I. While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a more accurate assessment of its value and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Bridge:** You acknowledge Bob's offer and his desire for fairness, building rapport and demonstrating you're negotiating in good faith.
* **Hold Firm, But Compromise:** While rejecting his initial offer, you significantly reduce your asking price, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:** You reiterate the product's value, justifying the higher counteroffer and subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher number.
* **Positive Framing:**  The language focuses on ""finding a mutually beneficial agreement"" to maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $1,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential and my willingness to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above your minimum threshold of $800,000 and demonstrates his serious interest in the product. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
