# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $800000 is below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1000000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price you're comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $900000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While she's shown some flexibility, it's clear she's unlikely to budge much further.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John at your maximum price to ensure you get it."
