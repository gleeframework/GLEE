Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this product is worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a compromise to get it sold. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $920,000 is still above my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further.  Since John is offering the product for my desired price of $800,000, it's more efficient to purchase from him and secure the deal."
