"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this product is worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a compromise to get it sold. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,5,
