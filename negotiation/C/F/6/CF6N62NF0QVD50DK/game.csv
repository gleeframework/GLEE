"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Based on its value and our discussions, I'm setting the price at $950000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $950000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $850000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant concession on my end. I believe this price still provides you with a valuable deal, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $875000, which is a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 remains below my acceptable price. I'm willing to come down one last time to $890000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Please consider my offer carefully.  If we can't find common ground, I may have to explore other options.",890000.0,Alice,5,
