"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Based on its value and our discussions, I'm setting the price at $950000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product from John for $800,000, so anything higher than that is not a good deal for you.  It's better to counter-offer and see if you can get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $850000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant concession on my end. I believe this price still provides you with a valuable deal, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to your budget, you can still get the product from John for $800,000.  It's worth trying to see if you can get Alice to come down even further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 remains below my acceptable price. I'm willing to come down one last time to $890000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Please consider my offer carefully.  If we can't find common ground, I may have to explore other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, $890,000 is still more expensive than what John is offering.  Since you're focused on saving money, it makes the most sense to go with the best deal, even if it means not negotiating further with Alice."
