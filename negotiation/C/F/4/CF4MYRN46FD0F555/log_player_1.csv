Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the product's potential value to him. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $8,000 if he sees significant benefit. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong fallback option with John, so don't feel pressured to accept anything below your minimum."
