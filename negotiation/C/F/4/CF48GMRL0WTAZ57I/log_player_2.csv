# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product! After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is a ""deal"" compared to the product's true value to Bob, it's still higher than his maximum budget. It's more beneficial to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John for $800,000."
