"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to John's offer as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above John's price, suggesting that Bob is serious about buying from Alice but is unwilling to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price from Alice.  It's still early in the negotiation process, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further in price to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that he is serious about negotiating a deal with her, but he's still not willing to pay her full asking price.  The offer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, but it's still a significant discount from Alice's last offer.  This could entice Alice to accept, or at least motivate her to come down further in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. While Alice is demonstrating some flexibility, it's still a significant difference.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and it's possible that Alice will be willing to come down further to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying from her, but he is still trying to get the best possible price. He's getting closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway, but still maintains some distance from her last offer. This approach might convince Alice to accept or at least make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still much higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. With only a few rounds remaining, it's unlikely that Alice will drop her price significantly enough to make it worthwhile for Bob.  It's better for Bob to secure the product from John at a much lower price.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is that she might not accept any of Bob's future counteroffers, and he could end up with nothing."
