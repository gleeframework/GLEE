I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000.

I'll make a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is still below your valuation but closer to a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
