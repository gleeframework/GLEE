"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is slightly above my minimum price to ensure we can come to a fair agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is still below your valuation but closer to a fair price for me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
