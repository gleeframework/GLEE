"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we try $750,000 and see if we can make this work?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my best and final offer on the higher end, but I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise a bit. To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I understand, but I might need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limit. I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $800,000, which is $812,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",812500.0,Alice,7,
