# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limit. I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's below my minimum price.

This is a tough one, but here's why accepting is the best move now:

* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:** She's made it clear that $800,000 is her absolute bottom line. By offering the halfway point, she's signaling a firm limit.
* **Time is a factor:** You're over halfway through the rounds. Continuing to push might annoy Alice and lead to a stalemate. 
* **Savings are good:**  While not ideal, $812,500 is still a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price.

Sometimes, the best negotiation is knowing when to take a good deal, even if it's not the absolute perfect outcome."
