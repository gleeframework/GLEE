"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone like you, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
