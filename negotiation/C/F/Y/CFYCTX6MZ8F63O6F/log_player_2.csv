"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone like you, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. However, I can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  I'll reject the initial offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming up in price, which is a bad sign.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'll need to counteroffer again to try and bring the price down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price, and I'm getting closer to my maximum.  While I'd prefer a lower price,  $1,225,000 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $1,500,000. I'll accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
