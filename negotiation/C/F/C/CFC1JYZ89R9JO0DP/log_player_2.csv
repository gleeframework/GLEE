"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He's still within his budget and there's room for Alice to lower the price since she values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a substantial discount. This aggressive stance aims to pressure Alice to negotiate seriously and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and can potentially get a better deal.  While Alice has lowered her offer,  she's still above Bob's target price. Continuing to negotiate allows Bob to potentially reach a price closer to his desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a final counteroffer at his maximum price.  This puts the pressure back on Alice.  If she rejects this offer, Bob can safely walk away and purchase the product from John for the same price. This strategy maximizes Bob's chances of getting the product for the lowest possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is only willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is still $20,000 higher than Bob's maximum price, and further negotiation would be unlikely to get Alice any lower.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, securing the product at his desired price."
