"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while also potentially maximizing my profit. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a good middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counter in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's getting closer to Bob's last offer, so hopefully, we can reach a compromise in the next few rounds."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to worry that he might be using stalling tactics.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him, and I don't want to risk going too low and regretting it later.  It's time to take the safe option and sell to John."
