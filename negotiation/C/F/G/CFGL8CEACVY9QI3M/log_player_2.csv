"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a decent price, it's still within your budget to potentially negotiate a lower price.  You can try to get closer to your $120 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get it for closer to $125. Would you be willing to go down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is now just $10 more than my target of $120. It's a fair price, and I'm likely to save more money by accepting this offer rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up paying more to John."
