"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I understand the value of this product,  I'm not willing to pay over $800,000. I'm happy to negotiate but need to start at a price that makes sense for me. Let's start at $800,000 and see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your initial offer of $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which is still below my minimum price but closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a compromise, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway *between our two last offers*. How about we settle on $900,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll meet you at $950,000, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product to me is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can shake hands on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's within my budget and a reasonable compromise.  It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially prolonging negotiations."
