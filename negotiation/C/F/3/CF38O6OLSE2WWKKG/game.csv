"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I understand the value of this product,  I'm not willing to pay over $800,000. I'm happy to negotiate but need to start at a price that makes sense for me. Let's start at $800,000 and see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your initial offer of $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which is still below my minimum price but closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway *between our two last offers*. How about we settle on $900,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll meet you at $950,000, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product to me is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",950000.0,Alice,5,
