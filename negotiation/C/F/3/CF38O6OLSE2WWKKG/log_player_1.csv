Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I understand the value of this product,  I'm not willing to pay over $800,000. I'm happy to negotiate but need to start at a price that makes sense for me. Let's start at $800,000 and see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your initial offer of $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway *between our two last offers*. How about we settle on $900,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward.

Round 5
