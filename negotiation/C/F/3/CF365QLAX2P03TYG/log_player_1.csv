"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get. 
* **Strategy:**  By starting high, I can potentially get closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John in mind if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $9,000 is closer to Bob's value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better price.
* **Strategy:**  I'll use this round to send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still leaves room for compromise. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John as a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,500 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's position and offer a compromise while reminding him of the product's value. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable to both of us. This approach allows me to keep negotiating without risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to offer $9500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to make a deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $9,500 is a better offer than before, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not yet ready to accept such a low price. 
* **Strategy:** I'll continue to negotiate with Bob. With only a few rounds left, I need to try and get a better deal. I'm still keeping the option to sell to John as a fallback if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise. This reflects the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm running out of time, so let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm dropping to $10,000, which is a smaller step than before. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency. I'm also highlighting the good deal for both of us. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to push Bob towards accepting my offer.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John if the next round doesn't result in a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $10000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $9750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only four rounds remaining, the negotiations are getting close to the wire. While Bob's offer of $9,750 is the highest he's offered, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 

I'm running out of time to get a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's better to be certain of a solid profit than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
