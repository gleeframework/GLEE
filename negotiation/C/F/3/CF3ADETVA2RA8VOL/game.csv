"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for $140? I believe this price reflects both the quality of the product and your perceived value for it.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer of $130. While I would like to accommodate you, I need to ensure that I receive a fair price for my product. I am willing to consider $135 as a counteroffer. This price still allows me to feel fairly compensated while remaining within your budget range.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. I was thinking more along the lines of $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",128.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad you're trying to find a middle ground. Considering your latest offer, I'd like to propose $132 as a counteroffer. This price is slightly above your previous proposal and brings us closer to what I believe is a fair compensation for the product.",132.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $132 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $129, but that's the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",129.0,Bob,6,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. How about we settle on $126 for the product? This price reflects my need for fair compensation while being mindful of your budget constraints.",126.0,Alice,7,
