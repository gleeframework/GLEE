"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you consider $10,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go as low as $10,800. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",10800.0,Alice,3,
