Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go as low as $10,800. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, securing the best possible price and achieving his goal of staying within budget."
