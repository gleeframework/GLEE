Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's maximum allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 ensures Alice won't be forced to go below that price."
