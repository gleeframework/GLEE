# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,450,000 is slightly above Alice's valuation, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000."
