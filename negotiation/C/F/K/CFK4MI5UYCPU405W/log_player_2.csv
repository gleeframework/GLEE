"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  $875,000 is a decent offer, but it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer of $850,000.  There's still room to negotiate, and  Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $875,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $862,500?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $862,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $887,500. Let's see if we can get even closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $887,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price, indicating there's potential for further concessions.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to lower the price and potentially reach a more favorable deal.  Additionally, Bob should keep in mind that he can always opt to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in making a deal, but $887,500 is a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $890,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final concession.  Pushing further could lead to a stalemate.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting the offer at $890,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's $1,000,000 offer and within Bob's budget.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation failing is high.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it altogether."
