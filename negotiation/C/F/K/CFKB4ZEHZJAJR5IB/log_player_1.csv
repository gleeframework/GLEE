Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering $115, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to ensure I get a profit."
