"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100. It's too risky to accept it at this stage. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, hoping to catch Alice off guard. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, and it will force her to reconsider her pricing strategy. I'm also being polite and expressing interest in the product to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price closer to my target.  I'll reject this offer and try to get Alice to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to overpay. I'm aiming for a compromise, and hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Alice than my previous one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $125 for the product.  This is a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is getting closer to my goal, it's still outside my comfort zone.  I am willing to continue negotiating to see if we can meet in the middle. I'll reject this offer and try to get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise by increasing my price to $120. This is a more aggressive move, showing Alice that I am determined to close the deal at a price closer to my target. I'm aiming for a final agreement and hope that this offer will be enticing enough for Alice to accept."
