"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $125 for the product.  This is a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's meet in the middle.",120.0,Bob,6,
