"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than the $1,500,000 he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a good starting point:

* **It's a substantial drop from Alice's offer:**  A $250,000 difference shows Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **It's still above Alice's minimum:**  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for her to accept.

This counteroffer gives Bob a good chance of securing a deal while minimizing his costs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant drop from her original offer.  At this price:

* **Bob saves a substantial amount:**  He's getting the product for $450,000 less than what John would charge.
* **It's likely the best he'll get:**  Alice has already lowered her price considerably. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further delays and a risk of her rejecting any future offers.

It's more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
