I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a significant profit for me, but it still leaves room for Bob to make a profit as well. I'm confident that he'll see the value in this deal and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit while hopefully enticing Bob to close the deal."
