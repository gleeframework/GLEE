{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. This also signals that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $145?  That seems fair considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to go that low, and I don't want to risk getting into a protracted negotiation with him. It's best to sell to John for $150 and get a guaranteed profit."
