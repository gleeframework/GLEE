"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice,  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget perfectly.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $100.  Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is simply too far below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $115. This gives us both a fair deal, and I truly believe you'll find this product worth every penny. ",115.0,Alice,5,
