{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly greeting and acknowledges Bob's potential interest. The price of $130 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a sense of getting a good deal. This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and encouraging Bob to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget perfectly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $100.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll make another counteroffer to Bob."
