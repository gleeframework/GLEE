"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. This price is fair and reflects its value to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675000. This price still reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",675000.0,Alice,3,
