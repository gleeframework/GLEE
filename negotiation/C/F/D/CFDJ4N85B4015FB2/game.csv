"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for this product. This is my maximum offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is less than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1250000. This price still reflects the true value of the product, but it shows my commitment to reaching a deal with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
