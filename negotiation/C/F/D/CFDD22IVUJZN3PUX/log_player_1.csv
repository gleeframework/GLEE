Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product for a limited time. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $150.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The high initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, it indicates he might be very price-sensitive. If he counters, it shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a backup buyer ensures that Alice is not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. She can always walk away and get her minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $70 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value of the product ($100).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this lowball offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and encourage him to make a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $70 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Anchoring):** By countering with $120, I'm essentially splitting the difference between my initial offer ($150) and his offer ($70). This creates the illusion of a compromise while still keeping the price well above my minimum.  It also sets a new anchor point, moving away from his lowball offer.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While $120 is closer to my desired range, it still leaves a small margin for further negotiation if Bob pushes back. 
* **Confident Tone:** The language remains positive and collaborative, emphasizing fairness and encouraging Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving towards a fairer price, Alice.  While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is negotiating, the increments are small and he seems fixated on a price point significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll meet my valuation quickly.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $100 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob for a potentially small gain. 

**It's important to value my time and resources. John's offer ensures a fair profit without dragging out the negotiation process.**"
