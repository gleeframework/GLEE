"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $70 for it.  What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $70 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a fairer price, Alice.  While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
