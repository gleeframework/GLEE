"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a price we both agree on.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your guns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my range. Given that the product is worth $10000 to me, I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle at $10250.  This way, I get a good deal, and you're still able to make a profit.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your proposal to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your proposal, which would be $10775. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to consider it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10775.0,Alice,7,
