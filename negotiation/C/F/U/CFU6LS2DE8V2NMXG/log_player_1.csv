{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for compromise. I'm hoping this strategy will encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to $9,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and continue negotiating until I reach a satisfactory price or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it matches what John is offering.  While I would prefer more, it's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since Bob's offer is already at my minimum."
