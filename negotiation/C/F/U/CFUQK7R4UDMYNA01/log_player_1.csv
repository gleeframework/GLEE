Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows John will pay her full value ($1,200,000), so she has a strong fallback position. This allows her to start negotiations with Bob at a price significantly above his perceived value ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal. This can be crucial in securing a sale.
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message subtly highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product without explicitly revealing Alice's bottom line. This helps justify the high price and encourages Bob to consider the long-term benefits.

By starting high and engaging in a dialogue, Alice maximizes her chances of either securing a price closer to her asking price or confidently moving on to John who will pay her full value."
