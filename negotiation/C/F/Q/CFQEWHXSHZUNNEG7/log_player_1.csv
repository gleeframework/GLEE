{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a little higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get at least this much, as John is willing to pay $10,000.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in getting a deal closer to his perceived worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get a little more, $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the deal and potentially having to sell to John for the same amount.  It's a good outcome overall."
