"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $8500?  That's a fair price for a product of this quality.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, this product is truly worth more than $7500. How about we meet in the middle at $8000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $8000. I'm willing to go up to $7200, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7200.0,Bob,6,
