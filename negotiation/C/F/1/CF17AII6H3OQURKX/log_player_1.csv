Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, hoping to get more from Bob.  I'm aware he only values it at $80, so this is a big ask, but it gives me room to negotiate down.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still well below my minimum of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit from the initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows some flexibility and encourages Bob to come up a little higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to justify continuing to negotiate with Bob. John's offer of $150 is guaranteed, and I'm not willing to risk getting less than that. I'm going to sell to John."
