Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll aim to get as close to the minimum value of $1,200,000 as possible. Let's say I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $1,190,000}

This is a relatively high offer, but it's still below the minimum value of $1,200,000. Let's see how Bob responds!"
