Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested but finds the price a tad high. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While close to your minimum, the price isn't so outlandish that Bob will immediately dismiss it. It suggests you're serious about selling but still valuing your product. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't know if Bob is aware of your other potential buyer. If Bob knew about John, he'd have no incentive to pay more than $120."
