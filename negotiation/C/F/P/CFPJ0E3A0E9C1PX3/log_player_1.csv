Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for in a product of this nature. I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
