Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I am hoping we can come to a price closer to my budget. Would $10000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum value, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I need to try and get a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit and still give you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I'm showing respect for Bob's position by acknowledging his offer.
* **Maintain my minimum:** I'm clearly stating my minimum price point but also offering a compromise.

* **Open to further discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for more negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still working within my budget, so I'd like to propose $11000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer $12,000, accepting $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  There's a risk of further negotiation resulting in a lower offer or having to sell to John for $10,000.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy at this point."
