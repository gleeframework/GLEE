"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. However, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for my investment. With that in mind, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850000.  This would be a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and would allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value I've invested in this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $975000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This would be a very fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident that this product would be a valuable asset to my business.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I've invested in this product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $925000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $910000, which is a substantial amount and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. This would be a win-win situation, as it's a significant discount compared to your initial offer, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find a common ground and reach a deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
