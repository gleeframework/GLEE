"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for a price that's below its true worth, and I get a quick sale. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $950,000 is a fair price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry, but $940,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
