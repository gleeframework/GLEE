"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm flexible and open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still significantly above John's price. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it. It's a fair price considering its market value and your potential gains. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's try one more time to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This is my final offer. "",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price.  However, $775,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we split the difference at $812,500?  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while still ensuring you get a valuable asset that will bring you significant returns.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  It's better to secure the product now than risk further negotiation."
