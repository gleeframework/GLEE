"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations.
* **Confidence and value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and my confidence in the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** While I'm starting high, I'm also leaving room for negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts. 

This approach allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm always aware of my alternative option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a deal that leaves me with a loss.  

Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value and continue negotiating.  I'm aware of the option to sell to John, but I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob, given the potential for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm flexible and open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $900,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and justifying the higher price.
* **Flexibility and negotiation:** I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate by saying I'm ""flexible and open to discussing this further.""  This keeps the door open for further compromise.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  

Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to counter with a more favorable price.  I'm also aware of my backup option of selling to John, but I want to explore all avenues with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it. It's a fair price considering its market value and your potential gains. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising but not conceding:** I'm lowering my price from $900,000 to $850,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still within my acceptable range and reflects the value of the product.
* **Highlighting value and benefits:** I reiterate the unique value of the product and the potential benefits Bob would gain from owning it. This helps justify the price and encourages him to consider the long-term gains.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  My message emphasizes finding an agreement that benefits both parties. This creates a more collaborative tone and encourages Bob to consider a compromise.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my interests.  I'm aware of my option to sell to John, but I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize the value of the product and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This is my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls short of my desired value.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I believe there's still potential for negotiation. 

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving room for compromise.  

Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to push for a price closer to my desired value. I'm aware of my option to sell to John, but I'm determined to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price.  However, $775,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we split the difference at $812,500?  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while still ensuring you get a valuable asset that will bring you significant returns.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 812500}
