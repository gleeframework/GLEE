"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm flexible and open to discussing this further.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it. It's a fair price considering its market value and your potential gains. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This is my final offer. ",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price.  However, $775,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we split the difference at $812,500?  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while still ensuring you get a valuable asset that will bring you significant returns.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,7,
