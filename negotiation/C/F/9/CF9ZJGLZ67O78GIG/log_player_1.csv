Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $17,000. This is above my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, since he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $15,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully closer to a price Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, so I'll sell to him."
