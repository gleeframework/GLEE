"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If you can't get a better deal, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that I'm willing to pay close to my maximum budget but not exceed it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still within my budget and is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John and paying the same price outweighs the potential for further savings."
