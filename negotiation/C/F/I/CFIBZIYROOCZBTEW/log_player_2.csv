Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I want to save as much money as possible, I'll offer a price that's closer to the product's worth to Alice ($12,000) than to the price I'm willing to pay ($15,000).

{""message"": ""I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's offer of $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's closer to my target of saving as much money as possible.

I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down a bit more. Since Alice's last offer was $13,500, I'll offer $13,000, which is the same as my previous counteroffer, but this time I'll make it a formal counteroffer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit shy of the price I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
