"Alice's offer:

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $94. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you close to the middle 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Alice is clearly trying to push the price higher.  At this point, accepting the $94 offer saves me $26 compared to John's price. It's a good deal, and further haggling might not yield much better results."
