"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
