"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me and still leaves you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. It's still a great deal for you, but it's a more comfortable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John for a much higher price. I need to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $800,000 is my absolute bottom line. It's still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit shy of $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my bottom line, I still have several rounds left to negotiate. There's a good chance I can get closer to $800,000 or even higher. I'm not desperate to sell right now and could always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still not there.  How about we split the difference and go with $775,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $750,000. How about we meet at $760,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $760,000 is tempting, I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate. I'm confident I can push Bob a little higher. I'm also aware that selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, so I'm not under pressure to accept a deal that's too far below my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. Let's split the difference again and go with $765,000. It's a fair price that reflects both our needs, and it's a great way to end this negotiation. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 765000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal. How about we go with $785,000? It's a fair price for both of us, but I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob is now offering $785,000 which is higher than my previous offer.  However, we only have two rounds left. I need to decide whether to continue pushing for a higher price or accept this offer. Considering that selling to John would guarantee me $1,200,000, but there's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round.  It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, even though it's not my ideal price."
