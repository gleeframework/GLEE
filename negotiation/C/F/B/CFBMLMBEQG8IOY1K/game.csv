"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",17500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,750?",18750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $18,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",17500.0,Bob,4,
