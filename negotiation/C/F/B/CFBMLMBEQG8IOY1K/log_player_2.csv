# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?

$20,000 is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,750

$18,750 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. Let's see if I can negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $18,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
