Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to maximize profit. Since the product is worth significantly less to Bob, I'm using this initial offer to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the gap a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still staying above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is consistently offering prices below my minimum, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  John is offering my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to John."
