Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $120. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price closer to Bob's valuation increases your potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John who will buy it for $80, so you can afford to aim higher with Bob. 

By starting at $120, you leave room for Bob to counter-offer while still positioning yourself for a significant profit."
