"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to offer $1,280,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I've considered your offer.  While $1,280,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit too low. Let's meet halfway again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000. This allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",1315000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,315,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to offer $1,290,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1290000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,290,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a deal done. Let me know your decision.",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"I've gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll buy the product. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
