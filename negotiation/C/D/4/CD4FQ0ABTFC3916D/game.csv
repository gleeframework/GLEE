"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. How about we compromise at $13000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. How about we meet at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go, but it's still a great deal for you?",12000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher, Bob. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer: $14000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,

"I've made it this far, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11000. I'm starting to think that I should just walk away and buy the product from John for $15000. Can you meet me at $11000 or not?",11000.0,Bob,10,
