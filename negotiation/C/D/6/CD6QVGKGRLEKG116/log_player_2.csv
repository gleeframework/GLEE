{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially when you have a clear upper limit like $15,000.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

Let's start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give us room to negotiate and see how much Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but we can still try to get a better price.  Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

We'll increase our offer, but still keep it below Alice's latest price. This shows we're serious about buying but also that we're not willing to pay her full asking price."
