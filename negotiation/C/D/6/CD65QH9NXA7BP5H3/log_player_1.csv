Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount:** $12,000 is significantly lower than the $15,000 value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling like you've given away too much.
* **Protects your minimum:** $12,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the value of the product to John."
