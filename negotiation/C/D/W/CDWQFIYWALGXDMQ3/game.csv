"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
