"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it, while still allowing me to make a worthwhile purchase.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1100000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, while also being more in line with your budget.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1250000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
