"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and to Bob ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, signaling that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any) or his willingness to accept my initial offer.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I cannot accept such a low price and still achieve my desired outcome.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to explore a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be more firm in my stance. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring I won't be forced to accept a price I find unacceptable.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming for a compromise that benefits both parties. I'll also remind Bob of the product's value and my willingness to negotiate, but I'll maintain a firm stance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is still above my minimum threshold ($800,000) but closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, highlighting that $850,000 is a fair price considering its worth.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll consider making a final counteroffer, possibly closer to $800,000, before turning to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 finally meets my minimum threshold. Accepting it allows me to secure a sale without further negotiation.
* **No Further Room for Compromise:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Bob has stated his absolute maximum, and further haggling might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time and Risk:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and avoids further delays. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale. While John offers the same price, Bob's offer has been achieved through negotiation and represents a successful outcome."
