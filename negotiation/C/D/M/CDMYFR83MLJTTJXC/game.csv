"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $8500 for it, which is still a great price for a unique item like this. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm thinking of a price between $10000 and $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $11000, but I'm still working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9500? This would be a good compromise and would allow me to buy the product without stretching my finances too far.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9500. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000. How about we try $10250? It's a good middle ground that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to make it a more attractive offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'll offer you $9875. This is a fair price, and it would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget. What do you think?",9875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9875. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. How about we try $10100? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to throw in some additional extras to sweeten the deal.",10100.0,Alice,7,
