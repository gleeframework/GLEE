"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated, and it's still a good deal for me. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $11,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not at a price I can accept.  How about $12,500? That's a big step closer to my original price, and I think it's fair considering the value to both of us. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
