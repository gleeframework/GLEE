Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that allows you a significant return on your investment. I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please consider my offer of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The Price:** $1,150,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), but still leaves room for negotiation and a healthy profit for Bob.
* **The Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, framing the offer as an opportunity for a good return on investment. It also suggests the possibility of negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases the potential for a higher sale price.
* **Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a possible compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Plan B:**  The offer is still significantly higher than my guaranteed price from John, ensuring I'm not taking a major risk."
