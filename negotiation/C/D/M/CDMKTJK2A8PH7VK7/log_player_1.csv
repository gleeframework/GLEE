Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your perspective, I believe $2,000,000 is a fair starting point considering the true value and potential of this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your position, and I respect the value of the product.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,825,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the true value this product offers."",

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to our minimum, but we're still above John's offer. We'll push a bit further, but we need to be prepared to accept a price around $1,775,000 or switch to John soon."

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're holding firm at our desired price point and making it clear this is our final offer. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a good deal or risk losing the opportunity. We're prepared to walk away and sell to John if he rejects this."

Round 8

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to meet our minimum acceptable price.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk Bob walking away and getting even less."
