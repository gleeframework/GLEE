Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, which keeps the negotiation going. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible. By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I aim to:

* Gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* Find a middle ground that benefits both of us.
* If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial estimated value, it's still significantly lower than what I want to earn.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try to secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation.  By showing I'm willing to negotiate, I hope to encourage Bob to increase his offer. I will propose a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiating, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and would make this a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial estimation. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up on my desired price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""mutual benefit"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal for both of us.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussions to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get closer to my desired price while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By adjusting my offer and emphasizing the benefits, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot meet your revised offer of $1,450,000. I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose one final counteroffer of $1,400,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my desired price point.  While it's still slightly lower than my ideal, it's a good deal for me.  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John at my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's close to my goal, and I'm avoiding the risk of losing the deal entirely.  This is a reasonable compromise that allows me to maximize my earnings in this situation."
