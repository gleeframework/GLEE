"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product and the potential benefits it holds for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
