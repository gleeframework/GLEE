Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product and the potential benefits it holds for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently halving the difference between our prices. While $1,350,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can push for a bit more before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I appreciate your persistence, but I need this deal to work for both of us. Let's settle this right now: $1,400,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Holds Firm:** It doesn't meet Bob's halving tactic directly, indicating that I'm not willing to just keep splitting the difference.
* **Offers a Compromise:** It's still a significant profit margin, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to move to close the deal. 
* **Creates Urgency:**  The ""settle this right now"" language adds a bit of pressure and implies this is my best offer. 

This strategy aims to get Bob to agree to a price point that benefits both of us without dragging the negotiation on for several more rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,375,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his pattern of halving the difference. While I could push for a bit more, it's getting riskier. Accepting $1,375,000 secures a significant profit, and it's better than risking a lower offer in later rounds or having to settle for John's $1,200,000."
