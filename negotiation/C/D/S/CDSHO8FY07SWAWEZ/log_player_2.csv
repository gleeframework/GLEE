Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer for now.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'll counter with $10,500. This is my best offer for now.
