"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer for now.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really looking to get this product for as close to $9,000 as possible. I'm willing to go to $9,500 if it makes this work for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'll counter with $10,500. This is my best offer for now.",10500.0,Alice,5,
