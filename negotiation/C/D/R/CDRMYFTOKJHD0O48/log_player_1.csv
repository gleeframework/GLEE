Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to let it go for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob has a good deal. Here's why:

* **Maximizing Profit:** $130 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving you a decent profit.
* **Attractive Offer:** It's a lower price than your fallback option with John ($150), but it's still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider.
* **Negotiation Space:** The message leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter with a lower price."
