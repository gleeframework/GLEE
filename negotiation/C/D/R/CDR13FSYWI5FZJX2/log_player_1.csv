Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you bargaining power. 
* **Aiming high, but staying reasonable:** Starting with an offer of $100 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Considering your fallback option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so any price Bob accepts above that is a win. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while ensuring a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
