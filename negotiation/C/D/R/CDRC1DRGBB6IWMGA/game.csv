"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $110 was a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $118?",118.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $118 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $122. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",122.0,Alice,5,
