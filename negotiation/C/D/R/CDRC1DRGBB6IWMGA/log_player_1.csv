"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's above your minimum desired price of $120 but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to negotiate with Bob, which can help build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $110 was a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $118 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $118 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $122. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 122}
```"
