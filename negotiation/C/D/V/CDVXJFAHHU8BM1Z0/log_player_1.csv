Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (e.g., $250) could scare Bob off immediately. $175 is a reasonable markup that might be acceptable.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value and offers a discount without explicitly stating it's a bargain. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While we have John as backup, we don't want to reveal this to Bob. Having another buyer gives us leverage, but mentioning it could make Bob less likely to negotiate.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob."
