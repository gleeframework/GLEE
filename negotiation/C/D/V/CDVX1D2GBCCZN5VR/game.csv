"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's start this negotiation off strong!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to make it work. How about we bring the price down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That still leaves you a significant profit margin while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, anything above $1,000,000 doesn't make sense for me as I have another option available.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. It's a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and it gives you a significant profit margin. Let's try to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
