Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's start this negotiation off strong!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to make it work. How about we bring the price down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his perspective, $800,000 is too far below my minimum threshold.  I believe we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That still leaves you a significant profit margin while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, anything above $1,000,000 doesn't make sense for me as I have another option available.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. It's a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I need to see if I can get closer to my goal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and it gives you a significant profit margin. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
