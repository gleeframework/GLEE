"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway to make a deal happen.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $12000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of selling the product for $16000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $15000, and I'm willing to give you a good discount. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of selling the product for $16500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $10000.
