"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset worth well over a million dollars to you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You'd pay $1,150,000 from Alice versus $1,200,000 from John.
* **You still save money:** You're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000."
