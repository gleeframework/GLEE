"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still limited to $10,000.  I'm confident this product is worth it to you at that price, given it's value to me is higher. Let's try to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to give you another chance to make this work, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'll make before I have to consider other options.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
