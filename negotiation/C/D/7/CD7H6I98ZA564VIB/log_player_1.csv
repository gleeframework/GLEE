Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Create Urgency:**  Offering a ""just below"" price creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a special deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims to maximize profit, it's essential to consider the potential impact on the relationship with Bob. If he finds out the product was offered to John for less, it could strain future interactions."
