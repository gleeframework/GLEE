"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's still a good starting point to see if he's seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to sell for that right away. I want to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm hoping to squeeze out a little more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
