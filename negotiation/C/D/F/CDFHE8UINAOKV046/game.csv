"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product definitely seems interesting, but $600,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $525,000.
