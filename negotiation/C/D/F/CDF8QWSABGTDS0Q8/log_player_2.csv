"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Alice has indicated the product's true value to *her* is $1,000,000, which means there's a significant margin for both of us to find a mutually beneficial price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  This price reflects the potential savings I'm looking for, but it also demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my initial counteroffer, but it's still above where I want to be.  I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price point if we continue negotiating. There's no need to rush into a deal, especially with John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to securing the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $790,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's closer to your target. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now within a reasonable range.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again is too high.  Accepting her offer at $790,000 saves me $210,000 compared to buying from John, which is a substantial saving."
