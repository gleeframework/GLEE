"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  This price reflects the potential savings I'm looking for, but it also demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to securing the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $790,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's closer to your target. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",790000.0,Alice,5,
