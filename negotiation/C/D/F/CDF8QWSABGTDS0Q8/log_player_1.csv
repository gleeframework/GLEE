Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  This price reflects the potential savings I'm looking for, but it also demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
