"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to counter with $19,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",19000.0,Bob,4,
