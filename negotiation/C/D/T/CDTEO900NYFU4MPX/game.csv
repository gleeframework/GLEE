"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique item. I can offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800.
