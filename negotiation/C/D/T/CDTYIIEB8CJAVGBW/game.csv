"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
