"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation but still secure a good profit.  I'm confident in the product's value and believe Bob will recognize its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but shows a willingness to compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable settling for less than $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm prepared to explore that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial asking price, but it still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as I'm running out of rounds to negotiate."
