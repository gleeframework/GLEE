"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, even to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects both the value of the product and the need to stay within a reasonable range. I'm confident this offer is fair for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What do you think?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $980,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
