"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in buying, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $13000? I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and quality. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $12800? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12800.0,Alice,5,
