It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

I'm offering Alice $700,000. This is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still a substantial amount. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to come down a bit."

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $750,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and her counteroffer.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, but it's still higher. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since it's unclear if she's willing to go lower. Buying from John guarantees a lower price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
