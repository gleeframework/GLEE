"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price needs to work on my end as well. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still a bit too wide for me. To be frank, my budget caps out at $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to keep exploring other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's below its true value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
