"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still a bit too wide for me. To be frank, my budget caps out at $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to keep exploring other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's below its true value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is not budging significantly and seems fixated on a price well above your limit. You've been clear about your $800,000 budget, and it's unlikely she'll meet it.  Cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
