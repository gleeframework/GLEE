"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go down to $120, Bob. I'm still confident that you value the product more than that. I'll meet you at $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",125.0,Alice,5,
