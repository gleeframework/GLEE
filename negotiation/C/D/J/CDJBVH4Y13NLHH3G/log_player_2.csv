Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $9,500? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,250 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, her ""final offer"" of $11,250 is still significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at this point, it makes more financial sense to secure the product from John at $10,000."
