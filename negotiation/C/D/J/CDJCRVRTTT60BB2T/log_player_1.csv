Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  However, it's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000.  This is still significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's a more realistic starting point for further negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a more reasonable price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for him to consider. This keeps me closer to my desired price while still giving Bob room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to get more than $15,000 for the product, Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm not comfortable risking further negotiation.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
