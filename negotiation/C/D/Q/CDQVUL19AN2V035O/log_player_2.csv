"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to pay no more than $80, and Alice is offering it for $100.  You can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $85?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high for you. You're aiming for $80 or less, and $92.50 is closer to her $120 value than yours.  It's time to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting a little concerned that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $88 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is my final offer, and if we don't agree, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has stated this is her final offer and is threatening to move on to another buyer.  While you could counteroffer again, it's clear she's not willing to budge much further.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $80.  You're still getting the product at a price you're comfortable with, and you're not risking further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
