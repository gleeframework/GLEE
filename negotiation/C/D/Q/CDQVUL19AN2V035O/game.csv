"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $85?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50? ",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a little concerned that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $88 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is my final offer, and if we don't agree, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer.",90.0,Alice,5,
