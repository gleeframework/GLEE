"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,100,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
