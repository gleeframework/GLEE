"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
