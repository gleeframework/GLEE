{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in this deal, as it still offers him a good value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,250 is only $250 away from my minimum.  It's a fair compromise and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the price even more.  I'll accept his offer."
