Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. I'll offer the product to him for $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll reject it. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my minimum price.

My counteroffer is: $1,100,000
