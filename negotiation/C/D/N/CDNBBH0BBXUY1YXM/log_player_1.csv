{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $135.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$135 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** This helps to build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

By starting at $135, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and think it could be useful, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything less than $150.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:** $140 is a compromise, closer to my minimum of $150. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Positive tone:**  I remain friendly and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal, but I'm still prepared to walk away if needed."
