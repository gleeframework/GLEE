"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,350,000? This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a fair price for my product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,300,000?  This is my absolute bottom line.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
