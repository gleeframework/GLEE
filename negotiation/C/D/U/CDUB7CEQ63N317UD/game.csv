"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900000 is a significant discount for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also considering your serious commitment to purchasing the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is a significant discount from the original price.

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to meet you at $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
