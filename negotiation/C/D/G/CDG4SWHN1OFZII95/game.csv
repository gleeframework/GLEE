"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, as that's its true value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to finalize this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $13,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
