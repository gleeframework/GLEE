"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I propose $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is pushing it. How about we split the difference and call it $1,600,000?  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
