"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's important to start the negotiation by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value that goes beyond its price tag. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $18,000 is still way too high for me.  I need to continue to push for a lower price, even though my maximum budget is $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints, and it gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be fair to both of us, I propose $16,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I need to keep pushing for a lower price, and see if I can get her down to my maximum of $8,000.  If I can't, I can always buy from John, but I want to try and get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're making progress. I'm still committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $12,000. This is a fair compromise given our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
