"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You'd pay $130 from Alice versus $150 from John.
* **It's still a good deal for you.** You value the product at $150 and are getting it for $130, saving $20."
