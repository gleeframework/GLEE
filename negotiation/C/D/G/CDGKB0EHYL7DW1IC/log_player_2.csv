Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $880,000, which is only $20,000 higher than my last offer.  With 5 rounds remaining, I can try to negotiate further, but there's a risk of Alice getting stubborn or the deal falling apart.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer and saving $120,000 compared to buying from John."
