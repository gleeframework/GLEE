"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $15000 to you. I would like to propose a price of $14000 for this exceptional item. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm not quite ready to go that high yet.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the tone for negotiation and demonstrates Bob's willingness to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better align with your budget, I am now proposing a price of $13500 for the product. This still reflects its value to you while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and is a good deal considering the product is worth $12,000 to Alice.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product while still saving money compared to buying from John."
