"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows me to potentially get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's still above Alice's value of $800,000, leaving room for a compromise while also giving me a substantial saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than my desired price.  It's good that she's showing willingness to negotiate, but there's still room for a better price. I'll continue to counter-offer to get closer to my target.  I have 7 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into an agreement yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. How about $875,000? This compromise allows us both to gain something from the deal.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a smaller decrease from Alice's last offer, signaling a willingness to compromise. It also keeps the price within my budget and above Alice's minimum, making it a reasonable proposition. I aim to find a price that is acceptable for both parties while still keeping my savings as high as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both.  Would you consider $887,500?  This is a significant concession on my end and demonstrates my willingness to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to my target price. Accepting this offer would save me $112,500 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I'd be left with only a few rounds to close a deal.  Given the potential savings and limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer is the most prudent choice."
