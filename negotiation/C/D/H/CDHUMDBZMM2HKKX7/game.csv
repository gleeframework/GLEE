"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can consider your offer of $9,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,200? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,200 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
