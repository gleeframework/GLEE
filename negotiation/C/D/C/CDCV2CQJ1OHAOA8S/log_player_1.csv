"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still reasonable given the potential worth of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my ideal profit margin.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher. I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer, as I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a good profit margin. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price significantly below my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant profit for me and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up with John's lower offer."
