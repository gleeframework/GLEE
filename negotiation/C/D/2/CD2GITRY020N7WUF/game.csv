"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
