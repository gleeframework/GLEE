"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly impact your business. We're offering it to you for $950,000. This price reflects its high value and potential benefits for you. We believe this is an excellent deal that maximizes both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice values the product at $800,000, meaning there's potential to find a price that benefits both of you.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, but it's not the most ideal solution due to the higher price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially save some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the mutual interest in reaching a fair deal, I propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to you while allowing us to maintain a reasonable margin. I look forward to your consideration.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price range.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice is clearly willing to compromise.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John if negotiations fail, but it's still not the most cost-effective solution.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
