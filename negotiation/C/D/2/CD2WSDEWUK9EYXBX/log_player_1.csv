"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,800,000. I'm confident its value will exceed this price."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a significantly high offer to establish a strong initial position and leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a much higher price than Bob's perceived value if he is particularly eager.
* **Confident Tone:** My message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly suggesting that my asking price is justified. 
* **Leaving Room:**  Even though John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I have ample rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially achieve a significantly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, understanding the value of your product might be subjective, I would like to propose a price closer to what I believe its worth. My counteroffer is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and steer the negotiation closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is firmly above that mark.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This demonstrates flexibility while still emphasizing the product's high value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price significantly above John's offer, allowing for further negotiation while keeping a comfortable buffer. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, focusing on the key point of the counteroffer without excessive elaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation. My counteroffer is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a substantial profit over John's guaranteed $1,000,000 and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. Holding out for a higher amount might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  While I have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner rather than later reduces uncertainty and allows me to allocate resources elsewhere."
