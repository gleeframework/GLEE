Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think would be really useful for you.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. However, it's still below Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, as you value it at $120."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $90?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$90 is a good compromise and is closer to my target price than what John is offering. It's worth closing the deal with Bob."
