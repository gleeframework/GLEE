"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $1,100,000 is still lower than my minimum value, so I have room to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone might make Bob more inclined to accept or negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Opportunity to increase offer:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to $1,100,000, potentially finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I emphasize the ""great value"" to remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language to maintain a constructive tone for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of your product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited time:**  We are already in round 4, and there are only 6 rounds left. 
* **Risk of losing a better offer:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal with him or even get to sell to John. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures I don't lose out on the opportunity."
