"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price that reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and is the highest I can go at this time.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being within your budget. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with this purchase.  Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
