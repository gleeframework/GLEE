"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is above your budget of $10,000. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that we'll go back and forth for a while.  It's more efficient to simply purchase the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
