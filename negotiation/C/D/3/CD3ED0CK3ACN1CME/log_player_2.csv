It's too expensive at $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

While $1,250,000 is getting close to my limit, I'm still only $50,000 away from John's price. I'll make one more counter-offer to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
