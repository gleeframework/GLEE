"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's highly unlikely you'll be able to negotiate down to a price you're comfortable with, especially in just one round. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price. This establishes a clear boundary and sets the stage for negotiation.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, it shows my serious intent to buy the product while remaining within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I want to see if I can push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still within my budget and is closer to Alice's last offer, potentially creating a more agreeable middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to my budget, I still see room for further negotiation.  It's worth continuing to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $12,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current one.  I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly above my comfort zone. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since we're down to the final rounds. I'm not comfortable committing to $12,800 yet and want to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12600}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small counteroffer, increasing my bid just slightly to $12,600. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget. Since we are nearing the final rounds, a slight increase in my offer might encourage Alice to close the deal."
