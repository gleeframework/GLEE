"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so I'm giving him a chance to make a counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent profit, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet.  I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  $13,000 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob yet. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800} 
```

I'm making a small counteroffer, only $300 above Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and reach an agreement, but also that I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm still not thrilled with the price, it's getting very close to my minimum.  It's probably not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and possibly ending up with nothing.  It's time to close the deal and take the profit."
