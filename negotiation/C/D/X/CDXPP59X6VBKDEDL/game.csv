"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth more than $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm proposing a price of $120. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both the product's worth and your budget. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product, which reflects its value to me and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer of $90. However, due to the high demand for this product, I need to ensure it goes to someone who values it equally. Therefore, I would like to counter with an offer of $100. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,
