# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer of $90. However, due to the high demand for this product, I need to ensure it goes to someone who values it equally. Therefore, I would like to counter with an offer of $100. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value.
