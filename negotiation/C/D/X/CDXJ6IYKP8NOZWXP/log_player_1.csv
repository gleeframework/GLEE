Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know John will buy the product for $100 as a last resort, I have a guaranteed profit margin.  It makes sense to start with a higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  By offering the product at $120, I'm giving Bob a chance to accept and net me a $20 profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always lower the price slightly in a follow-up message."
