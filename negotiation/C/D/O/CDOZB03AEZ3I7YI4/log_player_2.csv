Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've reached your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but I'm not sure if I can get her down further. Since John is selling the product for $1,200,000, it's best to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation."
