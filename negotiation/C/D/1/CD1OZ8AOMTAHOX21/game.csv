"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $10,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, anything over $10,000 is pushing it for me. My absolute final offer is $10,000 even.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
