"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1600000 is closer to my expectation, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This price still reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1700000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1700000, so I'm offering $1650000. Can we agree on that price?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
