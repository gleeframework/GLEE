"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a little more than I had in mind. Would you consider $11,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
