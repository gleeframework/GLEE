"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a lower price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a strong counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price.  This accomplishes two things:

* **Establishes our position:** We signal that we're serious about getting a good deal and won't easily settle. 
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:** Her reaction to this offer will give us an idea of how much lower she might be willing to go.

It's a calculated risk, as a very firm seller might be turned off by such a low offer. However, we have the safety net of John's offer if negotiations stall."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still above our target price and what John is offering. We know she's willing to negotiate, so we'll continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a little more than I had in mind. Would you consider $11,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We're moving closer to Alice's price while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness emphasis:** By suggesting this is a ""fair compromise,"" we frame the negotiation as a win-win scenario. 
* **Maintaining pressure:** We're not accepting her offer outright, showing we're still willing to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met us halfway, and $11,500 is a reasonable compromise. While we could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, it's getting close to the point where the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal. We're getting the product for $500 less than John's offer, which is a good outcome."
