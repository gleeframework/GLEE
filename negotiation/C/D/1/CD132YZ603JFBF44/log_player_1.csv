Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $15,000 as a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get at least $10,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message conveys a positive attitude and a belief in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

**Important Note:**  This is a strategic starting point. I'll need to carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers and behavior."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation and a higher price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price point, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome. 

**Next Steps:** I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob. I want to propose a price that is appealing to him while still ensuring I receive a fair amount for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,000?  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not all the way. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Reasoning and Justification:** I'm not simply stating a new price; I'm explaining why it's fair, linking it back to the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages further discussion and a positive outcome. 

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer, ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still not ideal. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob might result in further concessions and a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Income:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is a safe and reliable outcome. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of a $10,000 sale with John, selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision at this point."
