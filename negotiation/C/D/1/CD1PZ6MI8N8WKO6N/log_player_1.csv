Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm asking for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the product's value can make the offer more appealing. 
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give Alice valuable information. If he outright rejects it, she knows she might need to come down significantly. If he counters, it opens the door for negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, it's essential to maintain a respectful and professional tone throughout the negotiation to ensure a positive outcome, even if Bob ultimately declines the offer."
