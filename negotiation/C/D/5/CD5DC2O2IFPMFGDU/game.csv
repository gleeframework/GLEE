"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,500?  It's a fair offer, and we can close the deal today.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet at $13,000 and we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
