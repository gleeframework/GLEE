"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) and above Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price. This avoids making Bob feel like he has no bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:**  $85 is far less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. There are still 8 rounds left, giving us both time to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While John's offer is acceptable, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired price but still reflects some willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to sell the product at a price that works for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Within Range:**  $125 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Compromise:**  My message emphasizes that I am willing to compromise and meet halfway.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that it's still a good deal even at the counteroffered price.
* **Encouraging Response:** I'm asking for Bob's feedback to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $105 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, there's still room to negotiate. I'm not yet ready to accept a price below my minimum. 
* **Selling to John is still not the best option:**  I'm confident I can get a higher price with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, giving us time to find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $115 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still more than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?  This is a fair offer that lets us both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $110 is still below my desired price, it's only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This is a reasonable compromise, especially since I've already rejected Bob's previous offers.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  If I continue to reject Bob's offers, I risk running out of time and being forced to sell to John for $150.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, I can still potentially negotiate a higher price in future rounds.  

**Next Steps:**  I will accept Bob's offer but keep in mind that I could potentially negotiate a higher price in future rounds."
