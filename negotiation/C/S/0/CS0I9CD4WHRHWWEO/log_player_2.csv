Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to sell the product at a price that works for me.  Let me know what you think.

Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
