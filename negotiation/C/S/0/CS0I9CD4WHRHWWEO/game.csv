"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to sell the product at a price that works for me.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still more than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?  This is a fair offer that lets us both walk away satisfied.",110.0,Bob,6,
