# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, considering your value for the product and my need to get a reasonable return. Let's find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a great deal. However,  $1250000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1275000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to my target price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance she'll stick to this price or increase it, and I might end up buying from John at a higher price.  I'm comfortable with $1,275,000, as it's a good compromise and saves me a significant amount compared to John's price."
