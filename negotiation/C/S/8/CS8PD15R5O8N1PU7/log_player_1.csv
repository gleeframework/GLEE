"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than my minimum. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  I'm flexible, but I need to get closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my $10,000 minimum, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing Bob altogether.  $9,000 is a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the sale now than hold out for a higher price and potentially have to sell to John for $10,000."
