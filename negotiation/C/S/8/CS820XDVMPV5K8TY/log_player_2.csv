"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation. This tactic might encourage Alice to move down from her initial high price more readily.
* **Staying Within Budget:** Our offer is well below our $10,000 limit and even lower than John's $10,000 offer, giving us some bargaining power. 
* **Positive Tone:**  We want to maintain a polite and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above our $10,000 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have several rounds left to negotiate, and Alice seems willing to move from her initial high price. There's a chance we can get closer to our desired range.
* **John's Offer:** We have the safety net of John's $10,000 offer if negotiations with Alice don't work out favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about $9,500?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  We're gradually increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're not jumping too high too quickly.
* **Below Budget, Above John:** Our offer is still below our $10,000 budget but a good amount higher than John's $10,000 offer. This keeps us in a competitive position with Alice while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Seeking Compromise:** We're framing our offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Alice to meet us closer to our desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another offer for $12,000, but I'd rather make this deal with you. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is coming down, $11,000 is still $1,000 over our budget. 
* **Pressure Tactic:**  Alice mentioning another offer could be a tactic to pressure us. We shouldn't let it rush our decision.
* **Rounds Remaining:** We still have several rounds to negotiate. Let's see if we can get Alice closer to $10,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate that. I'm glad we're finding some common ground. I could potentially do $10,500, but that's really pushing my limit."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Limit:**  We're moving closer to our absolute maximum budget of $10,000. This signals to Alice that we're serious but also reaching our limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying it's ""pushing our limit,"" we're creating a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $10,500 still leaves a small amount of room for Alice to counter if she's completely unwilling to go below $11,000."
