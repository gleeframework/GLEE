"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you.  While I value the product highly, I'm currently unable to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price still represents a significant profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $1,000,000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
