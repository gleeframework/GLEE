"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Can you consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $18000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get a little closer. How about $19000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $19000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17500. Can you consider that?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. $17500 is definitely within the realm of possibility, but to be honest, I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway though.  $18250 would be my final offer.  What do you think?",18250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to go down to $17500, but that's my absolute bottom line. I believe this is a fair price for a product that's worth much more. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to go down to $17500, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16750. Can you consider that?",16750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're down to the wire here.  I'm willing to make one final concession. $17000 is my last offer.  If we don't reach an agreement, I'll be moving on to another buyer.  What's your decision?",17000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $16500. If this doesn't work out, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",16500.0,Bob,10,
