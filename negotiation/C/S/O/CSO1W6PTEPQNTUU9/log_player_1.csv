{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, but it also sets a high initial price that is closer to my ideal selling point. This allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to accept that just yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750?  I think that's a fair compromise that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,750. How about we meet at $12,200? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has come down significantly from his original counteroffer, and we're getting close to a deal. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, I think it's in my best interest to accept his offer of $12,200. This is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000."
