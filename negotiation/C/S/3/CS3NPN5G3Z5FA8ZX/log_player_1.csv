"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to create a positive atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product ($15,000).  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's still a good deal, and it gets us closer to finding a price we both agree on.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a counter-offer at $12,500, which is still higher than Bob's offer but represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price. I'm also trying to keep the conversation positive and focused on finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer again, trying to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $12,000? That's a very fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer at $12,000, which is just below my minimum price but still a significant amount of money for Bob. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for too little. I'm hoping that this will be a good enough compromise for Bob to accept."
