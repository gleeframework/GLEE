"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's still a good deal, and it gets us closer to finding a price we both agree on.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a better price. You have room to counteroffer before reaching John's price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $12,000? That's a very fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your target price of $12,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as you won't get a better deal."
