"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's still a good deal, and it gets us closer to finding a price we both agree on.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $12,000? That's a very fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",12000.0,Alice,5,
