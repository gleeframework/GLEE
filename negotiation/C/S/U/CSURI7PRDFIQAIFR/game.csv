"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Considering its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding common ground. Let's make this simple: $1,150,000, and we have a deal. This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe the value you'll receive far outweighs the cost.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll propose a price of $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
