"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the competitive price, I'm working within a specific budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $500,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering my budget constraints.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still a bit high for my current budget.  How about we settle at $600,000? That seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working within my constraints.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",650000.0,Alice,5,
