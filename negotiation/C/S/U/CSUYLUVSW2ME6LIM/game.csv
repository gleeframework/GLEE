"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",130.0,Bob,4,
