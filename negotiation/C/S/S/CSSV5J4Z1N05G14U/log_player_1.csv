Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a fair price that leaves room for negotiation.  I'm asking for a price that's higher than my minimum but lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay. This increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still below Bob's perceived value, but it's a compromise from my previous offer. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87.5 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's getting closer to my initial target. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
