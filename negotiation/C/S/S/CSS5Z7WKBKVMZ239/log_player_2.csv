{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no reason to accept it at this stage. It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This signals my serious intent to buy the product, but also establishes a clear limit. It's a bold move, but I'm hoping Alice might be willing to negotiate down from her initial price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still far above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,000.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to Alice's price, but still keeping it well below my initial offer.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my bargaining position."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is clearly coming down in price, $16,500 is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price of $8,000.  I'm also aware that I have the option of buying from John at any time, so there's no immediate pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $12,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal.  However, it's still below her current offer, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too far above my target price.  I'm hoping this move will encourage Alice to come down further in price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, $15,200 is still too high. I'm determined to keep negotiating, as I believe I can get a better price.  John's offer provides a safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the price hasn't dropped significantly enough to warrant further negotiation.  While $14,800 is lower than Alice's previous offers, it's still above my target price of $8,000. It's better to secure the product from John at a guaranteed price, rather than risk Alice rejecting my final offer and leaving me with no deal."
