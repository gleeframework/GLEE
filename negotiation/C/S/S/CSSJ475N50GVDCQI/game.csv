"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found out that the product could potentially be purchased from another source at a lower price. However, I would like to continue our negotiations. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000 for the product.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
