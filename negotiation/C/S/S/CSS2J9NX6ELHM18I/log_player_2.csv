Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I really need to get closer to my target price. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge much further on price.  At this point, accepting her offer would mean overpaying significantly compared to John's standing offer of $100. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
