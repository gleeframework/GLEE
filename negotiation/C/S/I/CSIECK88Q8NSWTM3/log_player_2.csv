"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a price that's closer to Alice's value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while also signaling his seriousness about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob! However, I have to make a profit, so I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing Bob to potentially secure an even lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, providing time to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price while demonstrating his willingness to compromise. By offering $100, he's splitting the difference between his previous offer of $95 and Alice's latest offer of $105. This shows a genuine attempt to reach a middle ground and may convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can do $110, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Alice has come back to her initial offer of $110.  While Bob might want to continue negotiating, he needs to consider the following:

* **Time:**  He's already gone through several rounds and has limited time remaining (5 rounds).
* **John's offer:** John is willing to sell the product for $120, which is a higher price than Alice's current offer.
* **Alice's stance:** Alice has shown she's firm on her price, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.

Accepting Alice's offer is the best decision at this point. It secures the product at a reasonable price while avoiding the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
