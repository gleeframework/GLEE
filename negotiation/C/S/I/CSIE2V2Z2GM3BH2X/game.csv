"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $13,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $13,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,500. It's a good deal for both of us, as it's within our budget and allows us to make a successful transaction. Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Bob,4,
