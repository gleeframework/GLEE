"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you and I'm happy to accept that price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or stick with your backup plan and save $500."
