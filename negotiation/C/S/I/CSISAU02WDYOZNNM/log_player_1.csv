Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, reflecting the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,150,000 is a good deal given Bob's budget and the risk of further negotiation.  I want to secure the sale rather than risk losing a deal altogether."
