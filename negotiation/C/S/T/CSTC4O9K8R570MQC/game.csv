"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $180 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a good deal.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $140 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
