You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm also willing to walk away if she doesn't come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round of counteroffers to see if I can close the gap further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering my maximum price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but won't go higher. If she accepts, it's a good deal for me. If she rejects, I can still buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to budge much.  While $1,020,000 is a decent price, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation. John offers the product for $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget, and guarantees a successful purchase.  It's a safer option to go with John."
