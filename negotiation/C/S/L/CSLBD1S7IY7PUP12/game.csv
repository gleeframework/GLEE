"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $7,500 for the product. It's a great price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good price for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,800 is still a little too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $8,200. This is a great price for both of us, and it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
