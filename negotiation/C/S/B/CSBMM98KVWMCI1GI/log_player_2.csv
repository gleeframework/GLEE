"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you can likely get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price with Alice, potentially saving you some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  While $95 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $105?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $105, which is closer to your desired price range.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best move.  You're getting a good price ($105 is significantly less than $150 from John), and further negotiation could risk losing the deal or prolonging the process."
