"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer higher than that.  You can counteroffer to Alice in the next round and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your own desire to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirement. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  You can counteroffer again and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's work together and find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $11,750. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirement. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's offer of $11,750 is still higher than what you can get from John, and you only have 5 rounds left. It's not worth risking further negotiation to save a few hundred dollars when you have a guaranteed deal at a lower price."
