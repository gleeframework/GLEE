Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
