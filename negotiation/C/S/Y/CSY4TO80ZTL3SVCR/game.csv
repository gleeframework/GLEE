"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
