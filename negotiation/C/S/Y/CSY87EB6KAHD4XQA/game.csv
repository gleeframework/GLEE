"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $13500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,4,
