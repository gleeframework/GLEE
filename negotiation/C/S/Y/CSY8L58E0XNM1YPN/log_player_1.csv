"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a serious negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have several rounds left to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a higher price than his offer.  It's a smaller step down from my initial offer, signaling that I'm not desperate to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, we're now at a good price that's above my minimum and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
