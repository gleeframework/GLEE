"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to my target price, but I can still save more by negotiating."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price, and I'm not sure if I can get her to go any lower.  It's best to take advantage of John's offer and buy the product from him for $800,000.  This will ensure I get the product for my target price and avoid further negotiation."
