"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $15,000. There are more rounds of negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This offer is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his value of $15,000. Bob has more negotiation rounds available, and he should aim for a lower price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to negotiate. By proposing $11,000, Bob is closer to Alice's counteroffer, which increases the chance of reaching an agreement. This offer is still within Bob's budget, allowing him to potentially save more money compared to buying from John."
