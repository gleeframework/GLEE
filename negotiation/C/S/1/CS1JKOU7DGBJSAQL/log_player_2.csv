"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration and evaluation of its value, I am offering this product to you at a special price of $9,500. This is a significant discount from its true worth of $10,000, which I believe represents an excellent investment for you considering its value to you is estimated at $8,000. I trust that you will find the product invaluable and worth the investment. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is discounted, it's still significantly higher than your maximum valuation of $8,000 and the price John offers ($8,000). By rejecting this offer, you can pursue a better deal with John."
