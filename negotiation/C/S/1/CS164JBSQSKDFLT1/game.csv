"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's worth discussing. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 yet. I can do $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This seems like a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can do $1,075,000, which is a bit above your last offer, but still below my initial price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,037,500.  Let me know if this works for you, as I need to explore other options if it doesn't.",1037500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000, which is a compromise. What do you think?",1065000.0,Alice,9,
