{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is attractive to Bob, while still giving me a good profit. It also leaves room for potential counteroffers.  The message is friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $11,000 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
