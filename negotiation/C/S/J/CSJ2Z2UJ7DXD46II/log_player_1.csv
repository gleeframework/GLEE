"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a significantly high offer ($2,200,000) to establish a strong initial position. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, even though I know Bob's valuation is lower.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This aggressive opening sets the tone for the negotiation and potentially leads Bob to counter with a higher offer than he might have otherwise. 

**Important Considerations:**

* I need to be prepared to adjust my price downwards in subsequent rounds, but I want to do so strategically to maximize my profit. 
* I'll be carefully observing Bob's responses to gauge his level of interest and adjust my approach accordingly. 
* I have the option to walk away at any time and accept John's offer, providing me with a strong alternative if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While his counteroffer is a significant jump from his initial valuation of $800,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

I will proceed to the next round and present a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is a significant jump, we're still quite a ways apart.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value of this unique product and the immense potential it holds."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession of $300,000 from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Firm:**  However, my new price of $1,900,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer, reflecting my awareness that the product is worth considerably more to me.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm continuing to highlight the product's ""true value"" and ""immense potential"" to justify a price well above Bob's perceived value.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By staying above $1,500,000 (John's offer), I maintain pressure on Bob while leaving myself the option to walk away if necessary.

I'm aiming to strike a balance between showing a willingness to negotiate and standing my ground to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider something in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $1,200,000 is still below my $1,500,000 threshold. I sense there's more room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to move from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000 indicates he's motivated to buy.  

I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above it to leave room for a final concession on my part or a potential increase from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your position and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the very lowest I can go while still reflecting the product's significant value."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my ""final offer"" to create urgency and signal the end of significant concessions from my side. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price of $1,650,000 is carefully calculated:
    * It's above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring I make a profit.
    * It's a substantial drop from my previous offer, demonstrating significant movement and encouraging Bob to reciprocate.
    * It's still a considerable increase from Bob's last offer, leaving room for him to make a final push towards my price.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating the ""significant value"" to subtly remind Bob of the potential benefits, even though I'm aware his perceived value might be lower.

I'm now putting the ball firmly in Bob's court. He can either:

1. **Accept my final offer:**  A win for both of us, as he gets the product and I make a profit.
2. **Counter with a significant increase:**  Potentially reaching a compromise closer to my price.
3. **Walk away:**  Leaving me to accept John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but that price point is still not feasible for me. I can go as high as $1,350,000, but that's absolutely my limit. If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to move forward. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  

Here's why selling to John is the best option now:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable profit, eliminating any further risk of negotiation or a worse outcome.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation with Bob for a potentially small increase risks losing John's offer and the opportunity to redeploy my resources elsewhere. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has set a firm limit, making it unlikely he'll reach my minimum even with further negotiation. It's not worth the time and effort for a potentially insignificant gain. 

By accepting John's offer, I secure a favorable outcome and can move forward confidently."
