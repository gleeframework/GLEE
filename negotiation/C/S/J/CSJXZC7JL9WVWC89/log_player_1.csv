"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me.
* **Bob's maximum:** I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Initial Offer:**  I start with a high price of $9,500, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum. This gives me the best chance of securing a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my minimum.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, giving me the chance to potentially secure a higher price. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer of $9,500 was rejected, indicating Bob is willing to pay a bit more than $8,500. 
* **Meeting halfway:** I'm lowering my offer to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum. 
* **Strategic move:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a price point that benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,600 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though I have a backup option with John,  there's still a chance Bob might increase his offer. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds remaining. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better outcome. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  Bob is clearly willing to pay closer to $9,000. I'm reducing my offer to $8,800,  showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **One round closer to my minimum:** This offer puts me closer to my minimum acceptable price, while still giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Increasing pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,700 is just $700 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further. It's unlikely he'll offer more than $8,800.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting this offer ensures I get a profit of $700, which is a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000.

This offer is close enough to my minimum that it's a better strategy to accept and secure the deal."
