"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $1,100,000 is high, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $950,000.  If you're able to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my valuation. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position.  Let's make this easy - $975,000 and we have a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my valuation. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final concession, and I expect a serious commitment from you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, that last offer doesn't make much sense given where we've been.  I'm willing to finalize this right now for $985,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer.",985000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to push me to my limits, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm now offering the product to you for $1,015,000. This is my final counteroffer.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
