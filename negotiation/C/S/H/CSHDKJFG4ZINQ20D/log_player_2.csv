(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough call! It's down to the wire. Here's how to break it down:

* **Alice's Latest:** $1,015,000
* **Your Limit:** $1,200,000 (John's price)
* **Potential Savings:** $185,000 

**The Risk:** If you reject and counter, Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John.

**The Dilemma:** You're currently tempted to go lower, aiming for around $995,000 (splitting the difference again). But, is risking the whole deal worth an extra $20,000 in savings? 

**Recommendation:**

I'd lean towards accepting.  Alice has drawn a hard line.  While there's a small chance she'll budge, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. You're still getting a significant discount. 

**Final Answer:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
