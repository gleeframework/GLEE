Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit if he accepts.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $20,000 is a high price, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  He might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still sell above your minimum.
* **Confident approach:** The message to Bob emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price. He might reject it outright, or you might need to negotiate further. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit."
