Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** It gives him some room to negotiate while still giving you a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves you open to negotiating further, ensuring you don't sell below your minimum value.

By offering a price slightly above Bob's value, I'm hoping to entice him to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I also have the backup option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counteroffer him and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  This would give you a good deal, and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Above Bob's offer**:  It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.
* **Below my minimum**:  It keeps the door open for further negotiation if needed.

By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. It's a fair compromise that gives him a good price and allows me to secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000.  It's also a fair price considering the value of the product to him is $8,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob."
