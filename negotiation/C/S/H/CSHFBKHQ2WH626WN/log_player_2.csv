Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. Can you meet me at $105?

It's unlikely Alice will go below $105, and it's not worth the risk of her going higher in the next round. You can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John."
