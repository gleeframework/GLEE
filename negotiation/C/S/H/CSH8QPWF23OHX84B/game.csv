"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows for a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant price reduction for you and still allows for a profitable deal. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
