{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This offer is a good starting point, maximizing my potential profit.
* **Reasonable offer:** $1,200,000 is still significantly less than the product's worth to Bob, making it a potentially attractive offer for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process open. 
* **Safety net:** I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't be stuck with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  While $950,000 is more than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, which means there's potential to reach a higher price. 
* **Avoiding hasty decisions:** Selling to John now guarantees $800,000, but a counteroffer could potentially lead to a better outcome. 

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows for a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Reasoning:**  I've justified the price by highlighting the value for both parties.
* **Open to final agreement:** The message implies that I'm open to a final deal, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant price reduction for you and still allows for a profitable deal. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

* **Profitable deal:**  While not the ideal price, it still yields a substantial profit.

It's time to secure the deal and avoid any further risk."
