Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,800 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially with the option to sell to John for $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,800 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $9,200,  which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 9200}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a good deal and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's also a solid price, considering the option to sell to John for $10,000.  I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiations and potentially lose out on both Bob and John."
