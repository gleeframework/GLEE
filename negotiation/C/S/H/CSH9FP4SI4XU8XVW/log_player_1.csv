"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation but is still a significant profit for me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a high price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,800. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, but it's still a decent profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer, as it's a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is a decent profit, I'm not willing to sell it for that low yet. I still have time and can continue to negotiate with Bob or sell to John as a last resort. I will try to get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  At this point, it's more likely I'll get a better offer from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
