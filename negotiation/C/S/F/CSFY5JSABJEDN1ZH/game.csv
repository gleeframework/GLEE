"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position.  While $12,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise considering its value to you.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which would be $12,750. Can you consider this price?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $13,250.  This price reflects the value you've placed on the product and is a fair middle ground.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,5,
