{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and set a starting point for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer with a slightly lower price, always keeping in mind John's $15,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price that's closer to $14,000, hoping to reach a compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not desperate. John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price.  A counteroffer will show my willingness to negotiate while also conveying that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position.  While $12,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise considering its value to you.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" and the desire to ""work together,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and collaboration.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value to him, strengthening my position.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer.  By offering a compromise, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer again, keeping John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which would be $12,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  I am not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed alternative offer from John.

**Strategy:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer is not yet satisfactory.  I will make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $13,500. If that doesn't work, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $13,250.  This price reflects the value you've placed on the product and is a fair middle ground.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than my previous one. 
* **Fair Middle Ground:** I'm positioning this price as a ""fair middle ground,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially encouraging him to accept.
* **Value Reminder:** The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value, reinforcing my position. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to either make a final, slightly lower offer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,250, which would be $12,625. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  $12,625 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Further Negotiation is Unlikely to Yield Significant Results:**  The price gap is narrowing, but Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. Continued negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that's satisfactory to me.
* **John's Offer Provides a Better Outcome:**  I can sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, the current price is simply not acceptable.  I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements and ensures a more favorable outcome."
