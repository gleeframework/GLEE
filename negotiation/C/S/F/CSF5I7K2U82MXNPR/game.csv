"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially setting the price at $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to my budget.  I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
