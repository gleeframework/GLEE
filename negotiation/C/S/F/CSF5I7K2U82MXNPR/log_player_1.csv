Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to my budget.  I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.
