Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.
