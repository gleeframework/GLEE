"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is simply not enough to cover my costs and the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a fantastic product at a competitive price.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
