"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,200,000. I understand it's worth significantly more to you, and this price allows for a substantial gain while still representing a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
