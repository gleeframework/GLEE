Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my valuation.  Given that, I propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal where we both benefit."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price around $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above our minimum. 
* **Win-Win Framing:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit and fairness, making it more likely for Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
