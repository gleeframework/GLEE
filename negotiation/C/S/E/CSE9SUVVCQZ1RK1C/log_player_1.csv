{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum price, giving some room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $120. Would you consider lowering the price to match my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150. While I'd like to sell it to him, it's not worth losing $30.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me. How about $130? It's still a great price for this product, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to stick to my budget of $120 if possible. Could you perhaps consider coming down to that amount? I believe we could reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I want to sell the product, Bob is sticking to his price, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best option at this point."
