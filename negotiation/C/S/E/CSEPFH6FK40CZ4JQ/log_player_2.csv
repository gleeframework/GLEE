{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is halfway between his maximum price ($15,000) and Alice's initial offer ($14,000). This shows he's serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, potentially leading to a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price. There's no more room for negotiation to save money.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his budget limit.  While he might get a better price if he keeps negotiating, it risks losing the deal entirely."
