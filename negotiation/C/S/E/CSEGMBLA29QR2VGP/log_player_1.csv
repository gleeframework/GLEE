Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's risky to accept Bob's offer as it's below my minimum threshold.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum threshold, and it's a good deal given the limited rounds.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future, and risking more rounds could lead to a lower price or the need to sell to John."
