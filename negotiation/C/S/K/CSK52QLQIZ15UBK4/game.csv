"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a significant price, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $1000000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
