"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $15,000. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move on to another buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
