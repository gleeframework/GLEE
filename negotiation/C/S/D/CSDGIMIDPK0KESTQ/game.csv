"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1600000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I need to know that's the lowest you can go. Can you confirm that?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already told you I can't go below $1600000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1550000. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $1480000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's make a deal. If not, I'll consider other options.",1480000.0,Alice,9,
