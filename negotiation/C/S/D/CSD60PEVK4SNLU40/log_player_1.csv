Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 allows for some bargaining if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Strong but Fair:** The offer is significantly more than your minimum ($8,000) but still a good deal for Bob (saving him $2,000). 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or how desperate he might be for the product."
