Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob engaged.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to respond and be open to negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By setting a price lower than my minimum, I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested. I can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $9,000 but lower than my minimum. This will allow for further negotiation and hopefully get us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer but still staying above Bob's counteroffer.
* **Clear Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (discount from original price). 
* **Focus on a Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that this price would still be a good deal for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a price closer to my target.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess if his counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might drag on and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John at $15,000, which is less desirable.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,500. This secures a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
