"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth its weight in gold!  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  He can likely get it for closer to $1,200,000, especially since he has the option to buy from John at that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. While $1,150,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,175,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $1,200,000. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. He's already made a counteroffer and Alice rejected it, so continuing the negotiation could lead to a better deal. He also has the option of buying from John, so there's no pressure to accept a price he's not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm prepared to offer $1,170,000.  This is a very fair price, considering your initial offer and my budget. It's almost at your desired price, and I believe we can reach an agreement here.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1170000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're so close to a deal!  I understand your budget, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer the product for $1,190,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and the compromises we've both made. Let's seal the deal and move forward! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,190,000 is very close to Bob's budget, he should still reject it. He's only got a few rounds left, and he can still potentially get the product for a lower price. He could make a counteroffer at $1,180,000 or even $1,185,000, and see if Alice is willing to come down further. If Alice rejects his final counteroffer, he can always buy the product from John for $1,200,000."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  I'm prepared to offer $1,185,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering your initial asking price and my budget. Let's finish this negotiation and close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1185000}
