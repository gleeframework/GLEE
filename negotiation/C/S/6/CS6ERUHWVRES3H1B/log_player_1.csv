"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. While $1,150,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,175,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm prepared to offer $1,170,000.  This is a very fair price, considering your initial offer and my budget. It's almost at your desired price, and I believe we can reach an agreement here.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,170,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can close the deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  I'm prepared to offer $1,185,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering your initial asking price and my budget. Let's finish this negotiation and close the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer, I only have two rounds left. It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's no guarantee he will accept my next counteroffer.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and it's a sure thing."
