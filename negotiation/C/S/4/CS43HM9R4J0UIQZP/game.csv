"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to land closer to my initial offer of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to meet me there.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
