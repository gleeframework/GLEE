"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and potential impact, I propose a price of $900,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's perceived value, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of a better price in future rounds or allows Bob to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its potential benefits to my business."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to work within your budget. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, he still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price. It also provides the opportunity for Alice to potentially drop her price further to secure a deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $825,000 for the product.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. After considering your proposal, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to suggest a price of $850,000 for the product. This still offers significant value while accommodating your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $850,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $800,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While a counteroffer could potentially get the price lower, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Rejecting and continuing could risk Alice getting frustrated or walking away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John. 

Given the limited rounds remaining, it's a reasonable strategy to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's very close to Bob's goal."
