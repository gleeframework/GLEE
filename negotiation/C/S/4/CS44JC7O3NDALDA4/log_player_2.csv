"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic deal and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a guaranteed alternative with John for $150. There's no incentive to accept Alice's offer since it's the same price, and you don't know if it's a good deal for you.  Rejecting allows you to potentially find a better price."
