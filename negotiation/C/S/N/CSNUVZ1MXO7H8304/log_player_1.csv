"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be acceptable to him if he sees the product's potential worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves room for negotiation, allowing us to potentially find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm comfortable with a high initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is too low,  I can still attempt to negotiate a better price. 
* **Exploring options:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value the product offers you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm highlighting the value the product offers to Bob to justify the price.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to further discussion. 
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:**  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in making a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I understand the value, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Exploring options:**  Selling to John right now would be a safe bet, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  Could we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm genuinely trying to find a solution that works for both of us. Let me know if this is something you can consider."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground that's closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Shared Goals:**  I'm stressing the desire to find a mutually beneficial solution, which might encourage Bob to be more flexible.
* **Assessing Bob's Flexibility:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move further towards my price point. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum of $15,000, giving me some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your counter.  I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about we make it $10,500 and call it a deal? That's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below $15,000, which is my absolute floor. 
* **Negotiation continues:** I believe there's still room for a better price.  We're both getting closer to a mutually agreeable point.
* **Assessing Bob's Flexibility:** By rejecting, I want to see if Bob is willing to raise his offer further.  
* **Selling to John is an option:** While selling to John is always an option, I'm still optimistic that I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you consider $12,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm continuing to negotiate while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise & Finality:** I'm proposing a compromise, suggesting this could be the final offer, to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation productive.
* **Assessing Bob's Limits:** I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway and reach a deal. If not, selling to John becomes a more attractive option."
