Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs and the potential of this product.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product's inherent value is significantly higher. How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,075,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while staying within my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that outweighs the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short."
