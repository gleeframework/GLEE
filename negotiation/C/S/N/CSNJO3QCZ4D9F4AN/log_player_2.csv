"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  There's room to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value while still leaving me room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $125?  That's still a great deal for you since the product is worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is right that the product is worth $150 to me, but that doesn't mean I should pay that much. I'm aiming to pay as little as possible. There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about $118? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 118
}
``` 

I'm slowly moving towards her price, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a good deal."
