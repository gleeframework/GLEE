{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a friendly message, setting a positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $110, it's below your minimum.  I'll counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $125?  That's still a great deal for you since the product is worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about $118? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure we'll be able to agree on a price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting even less."
