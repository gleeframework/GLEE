"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm happy to buy it for $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon.  Let's close the deal at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $98. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $98. This is my final offer.",98.0,Alice,5,
