"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $77.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $82.50, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $80? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,6,
