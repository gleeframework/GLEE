Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $14,000. This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer of $18,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further negotiation with him is too high. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This will ensure I get my minimum desired value and avoid the possibility of a lower offer from Bob."
