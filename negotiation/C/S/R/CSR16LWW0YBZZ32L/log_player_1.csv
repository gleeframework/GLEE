"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob to incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The offer is high enough that Bob might reject it, allowing for the negotiation process to start. 

I'm aiming for a quick win, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** I'm still confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. 
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** This gives me plenty of time to explore other options and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for Bob.

I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John at any time for a much higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time to Push:** I've already made a concession, and I need to start pushing for a higher price. 
* **John is an Option:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, which is a valuable fallback.

I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm again rejecting Bob's offer but keeping the negotiation going.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a compromise that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Emphasizing Fair Price:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal. I'm still aware of my option to sell to John, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. How about $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $9,800 is still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation progress:** While Bob is getting closer, we're still not close enough for me to accept. 
* **Remaining rounds:** I have 4 rounds left, which means I have time to continue negotiating and potentially push for a higher price. 

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress satisfactorily."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $10,200. This is a good compromise, and it shows how serious I am about making this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm making a small concession, but I'm also making it clear that I'm approaching my limit. This is a tactic to push Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Expressing Seriousness:** I'm reiterating my desire to make a deal with Bob, hoping to encourage him to be more flexible.

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept. However, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to $9,000 as possible. How about $9,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to our last two rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Significant Gap:**  The gap between our desired prices is too big to close in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a much better deal. Selling to John ensures that I get the most value for my product."
