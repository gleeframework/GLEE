"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $120.** 
* **It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal.** 
* **Buying from John right away is not the best option since you have room to negotiate with Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in your product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **This counteroffer is within your price range ($120) and is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.**
* **It shows Alice you're serious about buying but are also looking for a better deal.** 
* **The message is friendly and keeps the negotiation open.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $108 is within your budget of $120.**
* **This is a good compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price.**
* **Accepting this offer ensures you get the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John.**"
