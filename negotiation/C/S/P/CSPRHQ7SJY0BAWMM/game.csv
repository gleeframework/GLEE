,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $9,500 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefit to my business.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product and your needs, I would like to counteroffer at $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,750. This represents a significant saving for you while staying within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I see, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to sell the product at $8,900, which is closer to your offer but still reflects its true value. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $8,900 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $8,750 one more time, as I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Considering our previous discussions, I believe we are getting closer to an agreement. I am willing to sell the product at $8,800, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value it holds for both of us. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.",8800.0,Alice,7,
