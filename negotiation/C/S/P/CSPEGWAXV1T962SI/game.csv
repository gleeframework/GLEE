"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still a little high for me. However, I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go to $8,250. It's the absolute most I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $8,250 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to throw in some extras, like a premium warranty and a personalized setup, to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the added benefits you're offering.  However, $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,100 for the product, which is my final offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the extras you've included.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",8100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $8,100 is a tough ask, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,100 and $8,500, which is $8,300. I'll throw in the premium warranty and personalized setup, and I'll even include a free consultation to ensure you get the most out of the product. What do you think?",8300.0,Alice,7,
