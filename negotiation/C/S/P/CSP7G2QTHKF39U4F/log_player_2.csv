It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, rejecting and counteroffering is the best course of action."

We are getting closer to the target price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There are still a few rounds left, so rejecting and counteroffering will give us the opportunity to get a lower price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for our target price. Since we're running out of time, it's better to secure the product from John at $15,000.  We can save more money than if we continue to negotiate with Alice and potentially fail to close a deal."
