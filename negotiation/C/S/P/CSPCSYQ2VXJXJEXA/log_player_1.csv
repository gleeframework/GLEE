Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $130 is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately hitting my minimum price.
* **The ""Fantastic Product"" Mention:** This adds a bit of persuasion without being too forceful. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 

I'll need to be strategic in my next offer to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for a product like this.  Let's try to meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from $130 to $120, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Re-emphasize Value:** I remind Bob about the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I phrase it as a question (""Let's try to meet in the middle?"") to encourage further negotiation. 

This approach should keep the conversation going and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with $110 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 threshold. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested. 

I'll make one more counteroffer to try and close the gap. If it doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $110 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last counteroffer before I sell to John.
* **Compromise Again:** I've lowered my price from $120 to $115, showing I'm committed to a deal.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I remind Bob that $115 is a fair price given the product's value.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
