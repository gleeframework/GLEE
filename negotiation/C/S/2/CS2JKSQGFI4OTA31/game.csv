"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,250. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference.  How about $12,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm willing to hold firm. I'm confident you'll love the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. Let's meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
