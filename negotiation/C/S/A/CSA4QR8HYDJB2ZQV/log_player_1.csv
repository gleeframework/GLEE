"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is still a bit low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds remaining, I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum price, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a sale with John and get $10,000 rather than risk getting nothing from Bob."
