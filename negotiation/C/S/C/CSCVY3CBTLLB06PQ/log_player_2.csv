Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  This product offers you significant value, and I need to see a price that reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $9,750.  This product is a real game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000 even?
