{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** This price allows for Bob to make a counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net and helps me gauge my negotiation strategy.  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown a willingness to negotiate. This indicates there's still room to reach a more favorable price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, hoping to find a middle ground. This keeps the negotiation process alive and potentially leads to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning and Appeal:** I'm providing justification for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, aiming to maintain a good relationship with Bob and keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal while still saving me some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with no sale and only the option of selling to John for $1,200,000.
* **Securing the Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and allows me to avoid any potential delays or uncertainties associated with further negotiations."
