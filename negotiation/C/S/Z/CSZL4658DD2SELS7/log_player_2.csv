Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible while still staying within his budget. 
* This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* It's also a reasonable starting point, as it is closer to Alice's minimum value of $1,200,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving Bob sufficient time to attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,260,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's minimum value as possible, but wants to ensure he doesn't go over his own budget. 
* This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise. 
* By offering a price halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, Bob demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement, while still striving for a good deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,270,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,500,000.
*  While Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer allows him to secure the product without exceeding his budget.
* There are still five rounds remaining, so the potential for further negotiation exists, but the risk of a higher price in subsequent rounds or a breakdown in negotiations leading to a purchase from John at a higher price is significant. 
*  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
