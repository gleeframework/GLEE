"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $11000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $11000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $11250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
