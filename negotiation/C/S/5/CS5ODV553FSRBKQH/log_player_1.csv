This offer is a good compromise between maximizing my profit and securing a sale.  While I could offer it to Bob for $1,000,000 and potentially get that price, there's a strong chance he'll reject it.  By offering $900,000, I still make a good profit, and there's a higher chance Bob will accept it, as it's within his valuation range.  If he rejects it, I can still sell it to John for $1,000,000."
