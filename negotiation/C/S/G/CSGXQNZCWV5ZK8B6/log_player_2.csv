"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you have a maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a substantial gap for both of you to find a mutually beneficial price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than the product's value to Alice.  It signals that you're serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic positioning:** It leaves a good amount of space for potential concessions, allowing for further back-and-forth negotiation without pushing Alice to completely reject the deal. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** This offer aims to find a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the deal by being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still not ideal for you. You can likely push for a lower price, especially considering Alice already rejected your counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last price but still staying below $1,100,000. It shows you're willing to negotiate but are serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reasonable expectation:** A price of $1,000,000 would be a good outcome for both parties. It allows Alice to make a profit and you to save significantly compared to John's offer.
* **Anticipating a deal:**  By offering a price closer to the middle ground, we increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement. This offer  also signals your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable price:**  $1,050,000 is within your budget and a good price considering the initial offers and counteroffers. It represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price but also risks stalling the deal or leading to a breakdown in negotiations. 
* **Time and opportunity cost:**  Further negotiation takes time, and you might miss out on other opportunities if you prolong the process. Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price without unnecessary delay."
