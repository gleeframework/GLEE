"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:** 

I'm starting with a higher price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in subsequent rounds while still keeping my minimum in mind.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm also confident that if I can't reach a better deal with Bob, I can still sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm being firm but also hinting at other options to create a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:** 
I'm pushing for a price that's more favorable to me, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob's offer is becoming increasingly appealing.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round, as it seems unlikely that Bob will go much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. Can you meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is only $2 away from my minimum. While I'd prefer to get $95, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for only $100 is too great.  It's better to accept the $92 and secure the sale."
