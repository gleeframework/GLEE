,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down to $19000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $17500 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer the product for $18500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find it to be a great value. Let me know what you think.",18500.0,Alice,5,
