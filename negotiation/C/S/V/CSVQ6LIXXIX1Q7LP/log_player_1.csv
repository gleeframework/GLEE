Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can start to negotiate down towards your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and are willing to negotiate with Bob."
