"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering an alternative purchase from another seller.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
