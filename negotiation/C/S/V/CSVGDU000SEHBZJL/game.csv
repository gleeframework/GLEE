"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, your offer is quite a ways off from what I believe the product is truly worth. To find middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects my strong belief in its value while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I consider a fair price. This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your decision.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
