Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Offering Bob a ""first chance"" can create a sense of exclusivity and urgency. 
* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both parties, starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't undervalue the product.
* **Backup plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product at your minimum price provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost out.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
