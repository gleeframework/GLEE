"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
