{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I'm sure it will be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $1,000,000 is still too low, considering the value of the product to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,200,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000. This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000 in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet halfway again. How about $1,075,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000 in the next few rounds. There's still some room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower price yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle again and go with $1,080,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to move a bit to get this done.  How about $1,070,000?  That's my final offer.  Let's shake on it and get this deal finalized. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation. There's not much room for further negotiation, and if I reject this offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer.  It's better to secure this deal at $1,070,000 than risk losing both Bob and a higher price."
