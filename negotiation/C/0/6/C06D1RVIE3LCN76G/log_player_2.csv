"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $11,000. This is more than Bob is willing to pay. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10500 is a good start, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me. How about $10800?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has a set limit of $10,000 for the product. While Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is closer to his limit, it's still above it. To stay within his budget and avoid further negotiation, Bob should go ahead and buy the product from John for $10,000."
