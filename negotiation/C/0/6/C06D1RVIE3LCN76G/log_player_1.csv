Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation, but it's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation, while still ensuring I can walk away if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with him to see if I can push the price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a good start, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me. How about $10,800?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 10800}
