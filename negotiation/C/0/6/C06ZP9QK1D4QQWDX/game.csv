"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To make this work for both of us, I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find a fair agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I can't agree to $1,300,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I hope this is within a range that we can both agree upon.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
