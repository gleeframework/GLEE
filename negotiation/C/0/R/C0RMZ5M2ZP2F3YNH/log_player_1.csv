"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $1,750,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000), but high enough to encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to create a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $1,400,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  I have room to move downwards, but I want to ensure I get at least my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I'll counter with a price that is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective but reiterate my own needs.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  Using this phrasing suggests a collaborative approach and makes it easier for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might have to settle for John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Time Constraint:** With 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing time by continuing to negotiate. 

**Conclusion:**  It's a good deal, considering my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing this sale. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure the deal."
