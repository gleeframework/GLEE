"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll see if Bob bites, or if he's willing to counter-offer.  If his counter-offer isn't close to my goal, I'll keep him negotiating or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic.  Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer, and we're very close to an agreement.  It's better to secure a sale at this point than risk losing him completely and having to sell to John at a much lower price."
