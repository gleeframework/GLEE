"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I can easily purchase it from John for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product to me and the alternative option I have.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,087,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,087,500 is still a bit too high.  Given my alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000, I'm prepared to offer $1,062,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and the opportunity cost. I'm confident we can finalize this deal with a small adjustment on your end.",1062500.0,Bob,6,

However, I want to remind you that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider selling it to him.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
