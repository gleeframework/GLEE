"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. While it's tempting to take advantage of the potential savings, Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob has leverage in this negotiation, knowing he can buy from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to set the stage for a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I can easily purchase it from John for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is a better deal than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob is within his leverage range by considering the alternative option of purchasing from John.  Bob has the opportunity to push for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing the negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product to me and the alternative option I have.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,087,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While this offer is getting closer to his desired price, it's still above the $1,000,000 he can get from John. Bob has the upper hand and can push for a lower price. By rejecting the offer, he maintains leverage and continues the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,087,500 is still a bit too high.  Given my alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000, I'm prepared to offer $1,062,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and the opportunity cost. I'm confident we can finalize this deal with a small adjustment on your end."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,062,500. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. However, I want to remind you that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider selling it to him. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his target price of $1,000,000, it's a good deal considering the alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Alice's mention of John is a strong indicator that she's willing to walk away if she doesn't get a price closer to her valuation.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving $25,000 compared to buying from John.  At this point, continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing the deal altogether."
