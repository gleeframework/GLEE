"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,750 for the product. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. While I appreciate your offer, $13,750 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,375?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14375.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll meet you at $14,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John.",14000.0,Bob,6,
