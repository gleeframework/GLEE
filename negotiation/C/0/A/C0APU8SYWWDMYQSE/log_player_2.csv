# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer, as you can get the same product from John for the same price.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to get a better deal from another seller or potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
