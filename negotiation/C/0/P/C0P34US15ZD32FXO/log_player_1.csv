"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, and I expect Bob to counteroffer. My goal is to get as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible within the 10 rounds. I also want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility, and hopefully  enough to reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with $1,700,000. We're getting closer to my minimum, but I'm going to counteroffer in the next round. There are still plenty of rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,850,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I want to show that I'm serious about making a deal. If this doesn't work, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and we're getting close to my minimum. Accepting his offer for $1,750,000 is a good outcome, considering we have only 4 rounds left. There's a chance I could push for a slightly higher price, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
