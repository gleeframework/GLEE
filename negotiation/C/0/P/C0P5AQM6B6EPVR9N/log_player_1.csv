Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting at $15,000, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll assess Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for $8,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still a decent profit for me and shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure how much further we can negotiate.  While $9,500 is better than $8,000, I'd rather sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000.  This ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoid further potential haggling."
