"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
