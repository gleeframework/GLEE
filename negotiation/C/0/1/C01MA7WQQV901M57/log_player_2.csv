"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $130 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $130 is below his maximum price, he can likely get a better deal. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $115 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $125, he's still getting a good deal compared to John's $150 price.  There's a good chance he could continue negotiating and get an even better price, but with limited rounds, accepting is the safer option."
