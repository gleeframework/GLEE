"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000. There are still rounds left, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to make a profit, and $13000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $14500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $14,500 is still higher than his desired price. While this is closer to his ideal price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $14,500 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's try $14,250. This would be a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to at least $14750. I'm offering the product to you for $14750. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,750 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his desired $12,000. Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a slightly lower price.  There's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $14,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $14500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $14800. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** Only 3 rounds left.
* **Alice's last offer is still too high:**  $14,800 is above Bob's ideal price and there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price in the next round.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Even though it's not the ideal price, buying from John for $15,000 ensures Bob gets the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation.

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
