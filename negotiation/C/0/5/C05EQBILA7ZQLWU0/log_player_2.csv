"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still within Bob's budget and a good deal.  It's lower than Jhon's price and closer to Bob's desired price point.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids potential delays or a worse outcome."
