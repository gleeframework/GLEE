Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you want to start negotiations with Bob at a higher price. This gives you room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions ""initial proposal"" and ""open to discussing,"" signaling to Bob that there's flexibility in the price.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of its worth without directly revealing your minimum price.

This strategy aims to find a balance:

* **Maximizing Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial price or negotiates down slightly, you'll secure a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Ensuring a Sale:** By being open to negotiation, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, avoiding the risk of him outright rejecting the offer and forcing you to sell to John at your minimum."
