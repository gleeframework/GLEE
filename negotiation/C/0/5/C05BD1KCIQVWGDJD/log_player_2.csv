"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has immense value, and I'm confident it can be a significant asset for your company. My initial offer is $1,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows me to gain a good return while offering you a substantial deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,150,000, which is still lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $350,000 compared to buying from John.  There's always the risk that Alice might come down further, but it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
