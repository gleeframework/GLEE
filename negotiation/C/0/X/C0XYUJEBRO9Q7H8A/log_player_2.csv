"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know is worth a great deal to you, for a price that is significantly lower than its true value. This is a chance for you to acquire something invaluable at a very attractive price. Please consider my offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using sales tactics to highlight the supposed ""deal,"" $1,200,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
