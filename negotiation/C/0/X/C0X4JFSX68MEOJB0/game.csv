"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
