"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal for a valuable item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation while still leaving room for profit. It's above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000. This aligns better with my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price, as I have 8 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  My minimum price is $11,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a solution within my budget. Would $10,500 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $10,500 is still below my desired profit margin. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident we can find a mutually acceptable price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $11,000. This aligns closely with your last proposal and also fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would ideally get closer to that amount, with only 4 rounds remaining, it's strategically better to accept this offer and secure a sale. It's a win for both of us, allowing Bob to purchase the product within his budget and me to make a decent profit."
