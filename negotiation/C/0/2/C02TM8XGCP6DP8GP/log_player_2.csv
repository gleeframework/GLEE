Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This gives you a good price, and it ensures I can move forward with the sale. What do you say?
