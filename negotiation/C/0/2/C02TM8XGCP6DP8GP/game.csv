"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a price that works for us both.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This gives you a good price, and it ensures I can move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's try to make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 still isn't enough for me to consider this deal.  Let's aim for a final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise that will allow us both to move forward. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
