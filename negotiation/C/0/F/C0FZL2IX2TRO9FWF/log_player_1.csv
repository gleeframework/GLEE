"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), I'm employing the anchoring bias. This psychological tactic can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and set a higher reference point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial high price gives me considerable room to make concessions throughout the negotiation, potentially leading Bob to feel like he's getting a better deal in the end. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in the fairness of the offer, projecting confidence that can be persuasive.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while remaining open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I aimed higher initially, Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price with him, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting this offer secures me my minimum desired profit."
