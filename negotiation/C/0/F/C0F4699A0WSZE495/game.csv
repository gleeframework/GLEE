"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,400,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's much closer to what I need to sell.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,250,000. Would that price be workable for you?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum. To keep things moving, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're ready to make a decision.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
