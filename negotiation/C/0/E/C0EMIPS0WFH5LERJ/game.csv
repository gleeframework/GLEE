"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,150?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",9150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,150. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $9,600. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9600.0,Alice,5,
