Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I think  $1,150,000 represents a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's walk-away point is key:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he wouldn't pay more. 
* **Maximize your profit:** You want to get as close to $1,200,000 (your value) as possible, but leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **The ""fair price"" approach:** By framing the price as fair and leaving room for negotiation, you increase the chances of Bob accepting without revealing your absolute bottom line.

**If Bob rejects the offer:**

You'll simply sell to John for your full asking price of $1,200,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
