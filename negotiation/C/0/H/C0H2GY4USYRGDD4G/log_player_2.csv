"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your honesty about the price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate but her counteroffer is still a bit high. I'll reject and try to push her closer to my initial counteroffer of $800,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $850,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I'd prefer to pay closer to $850,000, $875,000 is a good price and saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John.  I'll accept this offer."
