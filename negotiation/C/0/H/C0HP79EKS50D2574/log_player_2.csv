{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this.  It's still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it gives you a great value for the product.  What do you say?
