"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can offer you a slight adjustment to $10,700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",10700.0,Alice,5,
