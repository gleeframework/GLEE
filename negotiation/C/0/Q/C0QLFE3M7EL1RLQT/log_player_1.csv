"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit and get as close to that $1,500,000 mark as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer, but still gives me a profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial offer, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
