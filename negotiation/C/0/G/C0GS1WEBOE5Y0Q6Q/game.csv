"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000? That's still a good price for you, and it's a significant savings for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this happen.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1,060,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll counteroffer at $1,090,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,090,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000, which is a good price for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the perfect price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,080,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,070,000 and $1,090,000, so I'll counteroffer at $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal soon.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
