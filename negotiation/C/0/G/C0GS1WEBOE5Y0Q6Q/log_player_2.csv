"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,000,000) and still lower than what it's worth to you ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000? That's still a good price for you, and it's a significant savings for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. This approach shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also respectful of Alice's needs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what it's worth to her, but it's getting closer to Bob's ideal price. While it's tempting to accept, Bob can still potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate.  There's still room for Alice to come down in price, and rejecting the offer shows Bob is determined to get the best deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's staying within a reasonable range. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.  He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his commitment to reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1,060,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll counteroffer at $1,090,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. However, it's important for Bob to remember that he has a backup option in John, who is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a better price and potentially reach a deal that's more favorable to him. He should also consider that with only 5 rounds left, he needs to be strategic and avoid letting the deal stall completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,090,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000, which is a good price for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1070000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer again, but still remaining under Alice's last offer. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway. By stating that this is his final offer, Bob is creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to accept the deal. He is also acknowledging the backup option of John, which helps him leverage his position during the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the perfect price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,080,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,070,000 and $1,090,000, so I'll counteroffer at $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than what it's worth to him ($1,200,000) and significantly less than Alice's initial offer.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the deal could fall through.  

With only 3 rounds left, it's crucial for Bob to weigh the potential savings of continuing to negotiate against the certainty of getting the product at a reasonable price. Given the current circumstances, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision."
