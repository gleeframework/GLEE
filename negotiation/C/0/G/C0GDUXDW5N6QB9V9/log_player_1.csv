"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a 20% markup on the product's worth to Bob, and it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counter-offer, but I want to start strong and see if I can get a good price quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for a loss.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his. It still gives me a profit and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at a loss. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob. There's still a possibility of finding a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a further concession, getting closer to Bob's offer. It represents a good compromise, as I'm still getting a profit, and it may be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but with only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000. It's a safer option, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to him."
