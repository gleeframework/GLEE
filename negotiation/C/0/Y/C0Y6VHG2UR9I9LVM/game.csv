"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure $1,300,000 is a good compromise, considering I was thinking more in the range of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
