Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering the product at $95 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer.  Even if Bob negotiates you down, you're likely to still get a price higher than your $80 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, you're not desperate to sell to Bob. This strengthens your position."
