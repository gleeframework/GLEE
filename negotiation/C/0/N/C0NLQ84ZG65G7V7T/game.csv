"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $14000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to get closer to my budget of $12000. I'm offering $13000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",13000.0,Bob,6,
