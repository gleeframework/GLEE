"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
