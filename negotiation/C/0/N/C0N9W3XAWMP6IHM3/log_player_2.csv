"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a lower initial counteroffer. This leaves room to move upwards while still potentially securing a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate. A significant difference between her offer and mine might reveal how flexible she's willing to be.
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the option to buy from John at $800,000. This gives us leverage. Alice needs to offer a price that's more appealing than simply going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be totally transparent, I've got another offer for $800,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  If not, I'll need to move on."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to John's Offer:** By explicitly mentioning John's offer, we're setting a firm upper limit for our price. Alice knows we have a viable alternative and are serious about not exceeding that budget.
* **Urgency and Clarity:** We're signaling that this is a ""take it or leave it"" offer.  This can prompt a quicker decision from Alice, potentially avoiding further back-and-forth.
* **Potential for Success:** There's still a chance Alice might accept $800,000.  It's a significant profit margin for her, and losing the sale entirely means no profit at all."
