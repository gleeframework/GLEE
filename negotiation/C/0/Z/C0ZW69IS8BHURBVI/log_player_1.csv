"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also aware that I can always go to John for $8,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I'm going to hold out for a bit more.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good deal, considering he started at $8,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to hold out for more, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate. Accepting his $9,200 offer means I'm getting a decent profit and closing the deal without risking a further drop in price."
