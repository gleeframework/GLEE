Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for your needs!  I'm asking for $140. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to sell below our minimum ($120). Starting high allows room for negotiation or for Bob to surprisingly accept. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the safety net of John who will buy it at $120, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is framed positively, focusing on Bob's potential benefit and presenting the offer as exclusive. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! We get more than our minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door to find a price between $120 and $140 that works for both of us.
* **Bob Rejects:** We sell to John at $120, still meeting our minimum."
