"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a valuable asset at a great price.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm proposing $1,075,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while also showing my desire to close the deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a little low for me. To get this deal done, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,7,
