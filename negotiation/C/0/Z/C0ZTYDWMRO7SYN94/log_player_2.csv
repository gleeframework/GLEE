# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. In light of your offer, I am proposing a final price of $1,120,000 for the product.

Accepting this offer is the best course of action to ensure a deal without risking a breakdown in negotiations and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price."
