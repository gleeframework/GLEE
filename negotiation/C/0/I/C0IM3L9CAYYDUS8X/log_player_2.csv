(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good deal, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get Alice closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $125, which is a fair compromise between Alice's initial price and my maximum budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my financial limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above my maximum budget. While I could accept and still save some money compared to her initial offer, it's worth trying to negotiate further. I'm confident I can push her down closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $130. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. I believe this offer is fair and gives Alice a good opportunity to make a deal, while still keeping me below my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my target price of $120. It's risky to continue negotiating because I'm already in round 5, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down to a price I'm happy with.  It's wiser to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $120, ensuring I get the best possible price."
