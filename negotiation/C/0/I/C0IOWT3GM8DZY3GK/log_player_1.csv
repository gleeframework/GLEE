"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate as he values the product at $1,000,000, and I'm confident I can close the deal within 10 rounds.  

However, if the negotiation stalls or becomes too time-consuming, I will switch to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob within the remaining rounds, especially since he's already shown a willingness to increase his offer.  

Selling to John now would guarantee me my minimum price, but I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a significant profit for me, and I believe Bob is likely to accept given his previous offer and the fact that he's already moved closer to my initial offer.

I'm aiming to strike a balance between being assertive and showing flexibility to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of time. It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob.  

Although I'm not satisfied with the $1,500,000 from John, it's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirement.  I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
