Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and meet in the middle at $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing for more."
