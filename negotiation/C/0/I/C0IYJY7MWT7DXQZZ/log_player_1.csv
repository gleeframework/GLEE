"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undervalue the product.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and presents the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door on negotiation, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profits while staying open to negotiation.  I'm also aware of John's offer and will keep that in mind as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  While it's closer, it's not enough to justify selling at this point.
* **I have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a better price.** 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob.**

**Strategy:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round but still staying above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** While I'm lowering the price, I'm not drastically changing my position, ensuring I still get a good deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. I'm keeping the negotiation moving towards a deal while still ensuring I get a price that's fair for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that, even though it's getting closer.
* **I have room to counteroffer again and try to reach a price closer to my target.**
* **Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob first.**

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility without compromising too much.
* **Emphasis on Closing the Deal:** The message reinforces the potential for a successful deal, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move forward with John's offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that, even though it's getting closer.
* **We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result for me.**
* **John's offer is guaranteed and meets my minimum acceptable price.**

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown of the deal."
