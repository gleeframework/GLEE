Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product worth even more to you. Let's start our negotiation with this price, and I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we start the negotiations at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired value by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budgetary concerns.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a more favorable price.  Would you consider $975,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating to see if I can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to secure a good price. However, $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway. I'm offering $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move closer to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum threshold, I can secure the same amount by selling to John immediately. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential further rejections, ensuring a quicker and more certain outcome."
