"Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product worth even more to you. Let's start our negotiation with this price, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we start the negotiations at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budgetary concerns.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a more favorable price.  Would you consider $975,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to secure a good price. However, $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway. I'm offering $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move closer to an agreement.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
