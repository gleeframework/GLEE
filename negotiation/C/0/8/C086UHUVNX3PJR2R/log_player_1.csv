Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the consideration. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
