"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $12,000 is less than your maximum of $15,000.
* **You save money:** Buying from Alice saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

While it's possible you might find a slightly better price elsewhere, the risk of not finding anything and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a small savings."
