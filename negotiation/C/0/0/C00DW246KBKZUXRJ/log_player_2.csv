Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.

Alice's offer is way too high ($2,000,000) compared to your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
