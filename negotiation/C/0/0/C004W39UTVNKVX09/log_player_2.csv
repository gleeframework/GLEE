"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is your maximum budget.**  There's no immediate benefit to accepting. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** You might be able to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John offers no advantage.**  John's price is the same as Alice's initial offer.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** A significant counteroffer (20% lower) shows your serious intent to negotiate while leaving room for compromise.
* **Test the waters:** This price gauge's Alice's willingness to budge and gives you a starting point for future negotiations. 
* **Room for concessions:** You still have 9 rounds left, allowing for adjustments if Alice rejects your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Potential for a better deal.** There's still room for you to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John offers no advantage.**  His price is still higher than Alice's latest offer. 

By rejecting, you can continue to negotiate with Alice and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  You're showing flexibility by increasing your offer, but not by much. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is halfway between your previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You still have 6 rounds left, allowing for more negotiation if Alice rejects your offer again."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still coming down:**  Each offer from Alice has been lower, demonstrating a willingness to meet you halfway.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There is still some room to lower the price. 
* **John offers no advantage.** His price is still significantly higher than Alice's current offer.

By rejecting, you can continue negotiating with Alice and potentially secure a price closer to your desired range."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near compromise:**  This offer is only $50,000 away from Alice's latest offer, demonstrating a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Testing Alice's limit:** This price checks to see if Alice is willing to meet you in the middle.
* **Leveraging time:** You still have 4 rounds left, which gives you some flexibility to adjust your offer if needed.

This strategy aims to close the deal quickly while still potentially securing a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is only $25,000 higher than your last counteroffer. This is a significant difference from the initial $200,000 gap.
* **Limited time:** You only have 3 rounds left. It's unlikely you can negotiate a significantly lower price in such a short timeframe.
* **No advantage from John:** John's offer is still much higher than Alice's current offer.

By accepting, you secure a good deal without risking the chance of having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's time to close the deal!"
