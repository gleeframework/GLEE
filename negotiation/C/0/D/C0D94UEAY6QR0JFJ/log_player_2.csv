"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer of $135 is too high.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's intention to get a good deal.  There's a chance Alice might reject this offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** Alice's offer of $125 is still too high for Bob, who is willing to pay a maximum of $120.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, potentially leading to a better price.  While buying from John for $120 is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Alice, and Bob may be able to get a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $110 to $115.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Alice's latest offer.  This counteroffer is in the ""sweet spot"" â€“  it's higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still lower than Alice's offer, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer of $120 is now equal to Bob's maximum price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate and potentially get a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for his target price and avoids the risk of further negotiations leading to a worse outcome."
