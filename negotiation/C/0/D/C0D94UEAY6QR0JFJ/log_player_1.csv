"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value of $120 just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price of $125, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also indicates that I'm not desperate to sell at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to sell below it. I'll reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering my minimum price of $120. At this point, I'm not willing to go lower, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this price."
