"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a good price for a product of this value, and I'd like to meet you in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll counter with $925,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a little below my minimum.  Let's try $940,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle again.",920000.0,Bob,6,
