"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a lower price.  However, $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for you as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still thinking that $1,200,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise and still leaves room for a good profit for you.  Let's make a deal!",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider this final offer?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
