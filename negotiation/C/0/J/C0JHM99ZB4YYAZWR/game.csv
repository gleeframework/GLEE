"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1250000. This price still reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair representation of the product's potential. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1000000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's potential value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
