{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly lower than my minimum desired price but still within a reasonable range. This allows for potential back and forth while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value and potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, the negotiation has stalled. Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price, and I don't see a lot of room for further bargaining. To secure the best possible deal, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
