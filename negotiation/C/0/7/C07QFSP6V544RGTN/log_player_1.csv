Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $15500. Would you be willing to consider this price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $15750 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $15500, but I think we can do better than that. How about $15250? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We've reached an impasse with Bob. While $15,000 is a respectable price, I'm getting close to running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
