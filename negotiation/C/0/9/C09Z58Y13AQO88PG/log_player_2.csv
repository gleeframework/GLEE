"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she is offering it for $140. This means there is room for negotiation.
* You are willing to pay up to $150, but you want to save as much money as possible.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $130, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $140 and my maximum price of $150. 
* This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. 
* Alice may be willing to accept this price, as it's still above her value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $145, which is only $5 less than what John is offering. 
* The potential savings are minimal, and the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or a stalemate is too high. 
* It's more efficient and less risky to simply buy from John at $150."
