While $112 is still a bit above your target, it's getting close. It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and if you reject this offer, you risk her getting frustrated and walking away from the deal. You also risk ending up paying $150 to John.  Accepting the offer at $112 is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
