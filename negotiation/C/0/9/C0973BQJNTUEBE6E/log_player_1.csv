Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'm selling that I think you'd be interested in. It's a great deal for the right person. Would you be willing to pay $95 for it? "", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This is a balanced approach:

* **Reasoning:**  $95 is a good starting point, higher than my minimum but not too high to scare Bob off.
* **Strategy:**  If Bob accepts, great! If not, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer. This allows for some negotiation room if Bob is interested but wants a lower price."
