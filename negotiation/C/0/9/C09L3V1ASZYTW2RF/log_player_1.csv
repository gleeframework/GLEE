Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, and I think you'll get significant value from it. How about we settle on a price of $15,000?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This approach aims to maximize profit by starting with a significantly higher offer than Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. Here's why:

* **Anchoring:** Offering a high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""fair"" price.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the $15,000, netting you a $5,000 profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you have room to negotiate down towards his $10,000 valuation while still aiming for a price higher than your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive or dislikes aggressive negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Your risk tolerance:** Starting high means a higher chance of Bob rejecting the offer outright. You are secure knowing John will buy it for $10,000, but there's a chance of missing out on a larger profit if Bob walks away."
