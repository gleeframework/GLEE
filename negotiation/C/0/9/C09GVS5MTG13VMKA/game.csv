"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is simply too high.  Given my budget and the product's true market value, I'm willing to pay $600,000. Let's work together to reach a fair price.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
