"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $17000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18500.

"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $16750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $16000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be willing to walk away if we can't meet there.",16000.0,Bob,8,
