Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is beyond my current budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the immense value this product brings."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I have a strong alternative with John if Bob won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm offering the product for $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $975,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I'm hopeful it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $925,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even at this price, I'm still making a substantial profit over my minimum ($925,000 is far greater than $1,200,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows me to re-invest the earnings sooner, potentially leading to further gains.  

While John's offer is tempting, the bird in hand is often worth more, especially when it represents a healthy profit."
