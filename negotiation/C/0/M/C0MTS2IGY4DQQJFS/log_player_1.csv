Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response.  I also have the safety net of John's offer to fall back on if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  However, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise,  halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this is a reasonable price that might be acceptable to Bob while still earning me more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise and is only $100,000 less than my initial offer.  It's also $100,000 more than what I'd get from John.  Accepting this offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit."
