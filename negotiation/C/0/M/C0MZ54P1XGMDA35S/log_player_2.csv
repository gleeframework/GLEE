"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's target of $12,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $12,500.  That's my absolute top limit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his target price of $12,000 as possible. He knows that Alice is likely to counter, but he wants to start the negotiation by showing that he is serious about getting a good deal. $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still significantly below Alice's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his target price. By offering $13,000, he demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a firm stance. This counteroffer shows that he is serious about buying the product but also that he is not willing to overpay."
