"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $850,000?  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this compromise?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm committed to getting as close to my target price as possible.  How about $805,000? This is just a little bit above your offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's close this deal, I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",805000.0,Alice,7,
