Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  While losing $50,000 is undesirable, it's preferable to potentially losing even more if negotiations continue and fail. John represents a guaranteed sale at your desired price."
