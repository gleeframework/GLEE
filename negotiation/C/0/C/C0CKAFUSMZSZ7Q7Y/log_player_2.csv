Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, but I can still try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,075,000. I'll make a new offer: $1,125,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, but also acknowledges your desire to find a fair price. Let's see if we can shake on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her walking away or me missing out on a good deal with John is increasing. Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product at a price that's significantly lower than what John is offering, and I'm confident that I can make a good profit on this purchase."
