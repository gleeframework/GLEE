"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value to me, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $14,000 and $13,000. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
