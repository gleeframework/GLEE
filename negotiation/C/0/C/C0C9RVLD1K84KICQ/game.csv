"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While we appreciate your offer, we need to maintain our minimum price for the product to ensure its value is respected. We would like to counter with a price of $800,000. We believe this offers a fair compromise between the value we place on the product and your budget constraints. Please let us know if this proposal works for you.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $800,000 is still pushing it for me.  How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"We understand your position, Bob, and we're glad to see that we're closing in on a mutual agreement. After careful consideration, we've decided to counter your offer with $775,000.
