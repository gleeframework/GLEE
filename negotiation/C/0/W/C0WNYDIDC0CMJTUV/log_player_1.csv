Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, and I'm happy to offer it to you before I take it to other buyers. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, meaning any offer above that price could be appealing to him.
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This provides a safety net and sets the minimum price you're willing to accept.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can potentially still settle above your guaranteed price from John.

This approach aims to maximize profit while considering the potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
