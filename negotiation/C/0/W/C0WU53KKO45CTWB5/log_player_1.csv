Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position, leveraging the fact that Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  I'm hoping he'll counter with a price closer to my target, allowing for a profitable negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always go to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price in the next round. This keeps the negotiation moving and allows me to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,400,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is holding firm at his minimum price.  I've already dropped my price once, and there's a real risk of getting stuck in a back-and-forth that could go on for the remaining rounds.  I'm confident John will pay my minimum price, and I'd rather secure the deal with him and avoid further risk."
