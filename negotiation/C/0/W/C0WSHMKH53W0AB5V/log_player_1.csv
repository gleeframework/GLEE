Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to be ambitious with my initial offer to Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000), I'm setting an anchor in Bob's mind.  Even if he negotiates down, it's less likely he'll aim for a price below my minimum.
* **Value Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential"" of the product to justify the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, I maximize my profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens the door for a negotiation where I can still aim to stay above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** I accept no less than $1,500,000 from Bob. If he rejects, I have the safety net of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
