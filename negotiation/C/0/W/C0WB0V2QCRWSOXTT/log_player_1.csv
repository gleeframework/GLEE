Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Protecting My Interests:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below $1,500,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. I'll always have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we set the product price at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offer is too low for me to accept right now. There's still potential for a better deal through further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and maintains my leverage. It shows that I'm serious about getting a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming for a compromise that's still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Profitable:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I'm not selling at a loss.
* **Fair Offer:** I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our perspectives. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and positions this price as a win-win for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to stay within my budget, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about setting the product price at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely push for a price closer to my minimum without risking the deal completely.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation alive and show him that I'm serious about getting a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer.  I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the fairness of my proposed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,125,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Still Profitable:** $1,125,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I'm not losing out on this deal.
* **Pressure to Accept:** By offering a compromise and highlighting the mutual benefit, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept.  It might be his last chance to get a deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  If Bob still rejects, I can always choose to sell to John, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I am willing to negotiate, I still feel that we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've been going back and forth, and Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to more rounds of back-and-forth, potentially wasting time and potentially not yielding a better price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is my minimum requirement.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John. I'm confident I'll receive a better price than I can realistically get from Bob at this point."
