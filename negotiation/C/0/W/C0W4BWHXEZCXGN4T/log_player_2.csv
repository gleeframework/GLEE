"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is above your limit.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $95, which is still below my maximum of $100. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still staying within my budget.  I'm hoping this will incentivize her to accept, as it's closer to her desired price than my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $105 is within my budget and represents a compromise from her previous offer. While I would prefer to pay $100, accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation and potentially needing to buy from John."
