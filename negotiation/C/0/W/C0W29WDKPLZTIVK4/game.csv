"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $990000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",990000.0,Alice,5,
