Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get a good price. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $120}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $90. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to the true value of the product. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $95}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to keep negotiating or sell to John if the opportunity arises!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob rejected my initial offer, and then made a counteroffer of $90. I rejected that offer and sent a counteroffer of $95. Now, I'll try to get even closer to the true value of the product. Here's my next counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $98}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll keep negotiating or consider selling to John if the opportunity arises!"
