"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, this offer represents a good deal for him, and it's a starting point that allows us to explore potential common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not desperate to sell and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who values the product at my minimum. I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $1,100,000, but it still leaves a substantial margin for me to make a profit. I believe this price is reasonable for Bob, as it's significantly higher than his initial offer of $850,000 and closer to his value of $800,000. I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $900,000 is still below my acceptable threshold.  I want to see if I can push him further.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, there's no rush for me to accept a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counter-offer to $950,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to increase his offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm feeling optimistic that Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his perceived value."
