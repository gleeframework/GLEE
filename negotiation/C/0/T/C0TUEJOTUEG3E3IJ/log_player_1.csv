"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm going to start high, but not too high.  This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also shows him I'm serious about getting a good price. I'm confident I can get at least $1,300,000, but I'm willing to leave some room for negotiation in the early stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000.  However, it's also a significant step up from Bob's last offer, and shows I'm not willing to settle for anything less than a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,250,000.  This is still a good price for Bob, and it shows that I am willing to be flexible and negotiate. However, I'm also getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm going to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already lowered my offer significantly.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a good deal, and it's better than risking getting stuck with a lower offer or running out of rounds."
