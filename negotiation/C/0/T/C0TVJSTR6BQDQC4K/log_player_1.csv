Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but it also reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident Bob will see the value and hopefully be willing to pay a decent price.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John's guaranteed $8,000."
