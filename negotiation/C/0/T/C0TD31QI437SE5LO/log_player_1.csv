``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and could be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit as well.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make at least $1,200,000 for this to be worthwhile for me.  I'll counteroffer him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid going with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. John is willing to pay my desired amount, so I'll go with him and avoid further negotiation."
