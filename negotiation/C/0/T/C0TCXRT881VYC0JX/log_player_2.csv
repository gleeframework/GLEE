# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

You can do better than $11,000. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to say that $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a good price for you. You can save $1,500 compared to buying from John, and it's still within your budget."
