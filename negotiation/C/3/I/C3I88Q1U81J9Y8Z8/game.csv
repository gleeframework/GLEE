"Hey Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $75? I'm really interested in this product but need to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go much lower than that.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $80, but that's my absolute limit. If we can agree on that, I'll take the product.  Let me know if you're willing to go there.",80.0,Bob,4,
