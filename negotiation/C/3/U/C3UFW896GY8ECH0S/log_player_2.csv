"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, her message suggests she might be willing to go even lower.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal before settling for $900,000."
