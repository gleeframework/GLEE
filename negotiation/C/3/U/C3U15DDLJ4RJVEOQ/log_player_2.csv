It's too early to buy from John.  Alice's offer is too high, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $9000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate while still staying within my budget.  Let's see if Alice is willing to budge."

Alice has come down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high.  I'll reject and try to get closer to my target."

I'm going to raise my counteroffer to $11,000. This is still a good deal for me and might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement close to this price."

Alice's offer is still higher than I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

I'm going to raise my counteroffer to $12,500. This is a compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a good deal to close the deal. If she rejects this, I might have to consider buying from John."
