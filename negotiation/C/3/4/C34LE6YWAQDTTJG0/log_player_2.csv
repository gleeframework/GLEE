**Explanation:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** $120 
* **John's offer:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the current offer is still within your budget and a good deal."
