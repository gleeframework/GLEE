"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $11,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll have to consider lowering the price, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum value in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum value. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still securing a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still feel there's potential to secure a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,250. This is a further compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my last offer and his last offer. I'm hoping this shows my commitment to reaching an agreement while still protecting my minimum value. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
