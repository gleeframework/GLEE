"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. I'm confident this product will be a great asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($1,400,000 vs. $1,500,000), it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for a price that fits your budget."
