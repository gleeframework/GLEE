"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its market value. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I have another buyer who is willing to pay the full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000. Bob can save $200,000 by going with John."
