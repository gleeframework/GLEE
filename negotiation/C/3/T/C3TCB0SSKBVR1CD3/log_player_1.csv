Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price is still below what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), so it's likely he'll counteroffer.  
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses positive language to encourage Bob to accept. 

This strategy allows for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price, and it leaves open the option to move on to John if Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my absolute minimum of $10,000.  Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Potential to Reach Agreement:**  Bob has shown interest by making a counteroffer, indicating that there's a possibility we can reach an agreeable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and keep the possibility open for a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  That's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffering Within a Reasonable Range:**  $13,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $12,000. 
* **Motivating Bob to Accept:** The message emphasizes that this offer is a fair deal for both of us, highlighting the value Bob will get while indicating my willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining My Position:**  This counteroffer is above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money while still showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to agree. 

By counteroffering at $13,000, I aim to find a middle ground and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
