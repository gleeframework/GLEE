"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can do better than $14,000.  You want to save as much money as possible.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, you can use that as a benchmark to negotiate with Alice.  You can start by counteroffering at a price closer to Alice's value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  That's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good deal. It's a reasonable compromise, and it saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. While you could continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $13,000.  It's a good deal for both of you, so accepting the offer is the best choice."
