"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget allows me to only consider offers below $1500000. Based on that, I would like to propose an offer of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. Considering its value to me is at least $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you're willing to pay and the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
