"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $90 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $80. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
