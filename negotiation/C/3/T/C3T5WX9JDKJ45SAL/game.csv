"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is definitely lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really committed to this product, but my absolute max is $13000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you. How about $14000? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute max is $13000.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to go with another option.  I really hope we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
