"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get $12,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is definitely lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really committed to this product, but my absolute max is $13000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, and I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet in the middle with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you. How about $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute max is $13000.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to go with another option.  I really hope we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob has made it clear that $13,000 is his absolute maximum.  If I reject his offer, I risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale, as I'm still getting a reasonable price and can always try to sell for a higher price to someone else in the future."
