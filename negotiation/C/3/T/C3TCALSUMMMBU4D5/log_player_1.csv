"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. It also leaves some room for me to lower the price if necessary.  However, it's important to remember that John is my safety net at $8,000, so I can't go too low too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's also a reasonable middle ground, close to Bob's offer, but still slightly higher. This should encourage Bob to accept the offer, as it's more favorable than his previous counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,600.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, we're nearing the end of our rounds, and accepting this offer is better than risking another rejection and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
