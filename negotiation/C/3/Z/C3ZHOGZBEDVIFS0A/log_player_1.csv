I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This gives me the best chance of getting my desired value. If Bob rejects, I'll move to Plan B with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm meeting Bob halfway.  This price is still higher than his offer, but hopefully, it's enticing enough for him to accept. If not, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range, and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  I'll accept his offer and avoid any further negotiation."
