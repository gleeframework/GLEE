Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts, Bob, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final offer: $110. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $110.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, we have a guaranteed option with John for $100.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best price."
