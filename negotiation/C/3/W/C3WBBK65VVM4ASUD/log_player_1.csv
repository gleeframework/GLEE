"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $125, which is a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention that the product is worth at least $100 to me, emphasizing its value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I use the phrase ""What do you think?"" to make it clear that I'm open to discussing the price.

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest while leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum value of $100, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have John's offer of $100 as a backup, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm counteroffering at $110, which is still above my minimum value of $100 but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Reiterate value:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why $110 is a fair price.
* **Open to compromise:**  I use the phrase ""Let me know if that works for you"" to show I'm flexible and open to a deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price.  I'm hoping to get closer to $100. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  I'm not willing to settle for $95 yet. There are still rounds left, and I can potentially get a better offer.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $100 as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reiterating value and profit:** I emphasize the product's value and my need to make a profit to justify the price.
* **Direct question:** I ask ""What do you say?"" to encourage a response and hopefully reach an agreement.

This counteroffer attempts to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:** $102.50 is higher than my minimum selling price of $100, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the negotiation process.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's offer as a backup:**  While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's still better than John's offer of $100, which I can always fall back on. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and maximizes my earnings within the remaining rounds."
