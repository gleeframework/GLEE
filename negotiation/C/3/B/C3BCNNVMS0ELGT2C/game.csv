"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,100,000? This shows I'm serious about buying, but also respects my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
