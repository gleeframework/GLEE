"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation.  While I understand your initial offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still very far apart on price.  To be frank, anything over $1,000,000 simply doesn't make sense for me as I can buy it elsewhere.  If you're serious about doing business, I'm willing to go up to $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer but are still too far apart.  I appreciate this isn't something I can find easily elsewhere, but I have a hard limit at $1,000,000.  I can do $850,000 to show I'm serious, but that's as high as I can go.",850000.0,Bob,6,
