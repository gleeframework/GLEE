{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a fairly high price, giving you room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. Remember, you can always accept John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point. I'm interested but would like to offer $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While $8,000 is your minimum acceptable price, you can try to get more from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
