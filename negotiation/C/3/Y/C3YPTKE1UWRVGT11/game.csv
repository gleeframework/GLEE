"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we try $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to at least get $1,040,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can bridge this small gap.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
