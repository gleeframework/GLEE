"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's price of $800,000, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is definitely interesting, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  There's still room to negotiate further, and Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  While $850,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $825,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a strong starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the details of the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $875,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John ($800,000).  Since there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a lower price, Bob is better off buying from John and securing the product at the lower price."
