"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is definitely interesting, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits the product can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  While $850,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $825,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a strong starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the details of the sale.",875000.0,Alice,5,
