Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable to both of us. I know this product can significantly benefit you, and while it's worth well over a million to me, I'm prepared to make a deal. How about we settle on $900,000? It's a win-win."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, Alice needs to get a price from Bob that's higher to make the negotiation worthwhile.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  Offering the product for a price close to $1,000,000 (but slightly lower) increases the chances of Bob accepting. Bob gets the product for $100,000 less than its value to him, which is a significant deal.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message uses language that emphasizes the value of the product while also conveying a willingness to make a deal."
