"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $7,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,750?",7750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $7,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,500 and $7,750, which would be $7,125. Can you consider that?",7125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  $7,125 is closer, but still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $7,437.50.  This is a fair price, and it lets us both get a good deal.  What do you say?",7437.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $7,437.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,250, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",7250.0,Bob,6,
