Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $10,000 offers a potential $2,000 profit over your minimum. This markup isn't so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $10,000, this doesn't mean it's your final price.  If Bob counters, you can always negotiate down closer to $8,000 if needed."
