"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $1100000. It's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely do better than $1,100,000. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're aiming for.  You can likely secure a price closer to $950,000, so rejecting the offer gives you a chance to continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1080000. It's a price that reflects the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but there's still some room for negotiation.  You've already shown your willingness to compromise, but rejecting the offer allows you to make one final counteroffer before you consider buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely that you'll be able to reach a price significantly lower. Buying from John guarantees you the product at a slightly higher price, but it avoids further negotiation and ensures you get the product."
