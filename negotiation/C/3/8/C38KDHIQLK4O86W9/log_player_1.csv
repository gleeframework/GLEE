Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to him, emphasizing the potential savings he'll get.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message doesn't close the door completely, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if he wishes. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
