"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** My message highlights the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer is my minimum price, which is not ideal. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can get a better price than $10,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John right now would only yield my minimum, while negotiating further might lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and signals that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain from owning it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage further dialogue and maintain control of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $10,750 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for improvement. 
* **Seeking a higher price:**  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's only slightly above my minimum value, especially since Bob has shown willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer involves the risk of him walking away, but it also allows me to potentially secure a better deal in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product and me to ensure a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and flexibility:**  I'm continuing to demonstrate a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway again, this time between my previous offer and his.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the new offer for both parties, aiming to create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Highlighting value again:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth and the value he'll receive, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price and is significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Risk of losing deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer again might lead to him walking away, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time constraint:**  With only four rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer seems like a safe bet to secure a good profit."
