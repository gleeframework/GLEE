"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
