Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.,10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet. I can offer you $9000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $9750. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,
