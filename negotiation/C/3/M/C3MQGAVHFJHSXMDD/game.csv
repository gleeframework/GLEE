"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is out of my budget.  Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This allows for a healthy profit for you and keeps me within my spending limit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer and understanding the value of this product.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to compromise, but $1,200,000 is my final offer.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit while still allowing me to stay within my spending limit.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
