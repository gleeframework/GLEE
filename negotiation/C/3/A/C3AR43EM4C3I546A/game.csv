"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to gain something from this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,275,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, given the value you place on the product.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a balance between your desired price and the product's value to you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession. My counteroffer is $1,225,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product. This would represent a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet you at $1,150,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is still a little higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to offer $1,175,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1175000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,175,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. My counteroffer is $1,200,500. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200500.0,Alice,9,
