"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it immediately."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. It's a price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $1,300,000 is better than buying from John, Bob can likely negotiate further.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This allows us to close the deal quickly and efficiently."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's try $1,280,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident we can close this deal if we work together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,250,000.  At this point, it's becoming a matter of ""splitting hairs"".   Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that's significantly better than buying from John, and the negotiation process is nearing its end.  Further negotiation may result in a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the deal."
