"Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it immediately.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. It's a price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This allows us to close the deal quickly and efficiently.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's try $1,280,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident we can close this deal if we work together.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
