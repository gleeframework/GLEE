Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my target price of $1,400,000 by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. It's a price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This allows us to close the deal quickly and efficiently. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's try $1,280,000.
