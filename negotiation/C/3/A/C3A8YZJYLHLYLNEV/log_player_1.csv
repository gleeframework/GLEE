Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,800,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to both of us, starting with a higher price gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing my absolute bottom line, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation door open. 
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my minimum acceptable price."
