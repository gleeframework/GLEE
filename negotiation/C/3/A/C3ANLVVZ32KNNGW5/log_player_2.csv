"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000. However, I can likely get a better price than $1,200,000.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Given the product's value to you, I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and your initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for me compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower than her current offer. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
