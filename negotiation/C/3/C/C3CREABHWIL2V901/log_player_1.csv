{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point for negotiation.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for compromise. I am confident that I can sell the product to John for $150 if negotiations fail, so I have some leeway to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell at such a huge loss.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $120 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I'm willing to make this compromise to get the product to you."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to keep the cost below $130. Could we perhaps agree on $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  It's not worth further negotiating with Bob.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him to ensure I don't lose money."
