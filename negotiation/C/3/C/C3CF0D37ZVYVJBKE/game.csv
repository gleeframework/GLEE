"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. $1225000 is close, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1200000 - my final offer.  This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and avoid any further negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
