{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth a guaranteed $1,000,000 to Alice (from John), she has leverage to aim high initially. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  A price of $1,500,000 represents a 50% potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer doesn't necessarily mean Alice won't negotiate. If Bob counters, she can always lower the price, knowing her minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uses positive language to encourage Bob's interest."
