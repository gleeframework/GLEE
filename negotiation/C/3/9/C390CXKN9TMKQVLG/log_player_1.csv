Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  Consider this my best offer:  $1,150,000. This allows you a significant profit margin while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Offer:** $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It gives Bob a substantial discount from his perceived value while still giving me a profit above my minimum.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for potential negotiation. I'm presenting it as my ""best offer"", leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed to sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no real risk in making this offer."
