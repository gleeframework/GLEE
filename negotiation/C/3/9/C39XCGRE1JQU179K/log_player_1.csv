{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""open to negotiation,"" I'm signaling that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob.
* **Asking for Feedback:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to gauge his interest and start a conversation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Avoid revealing my minimum:** I'm not giving Bob any information about my ""bottom line.""
* **Start a dialogue:**  A friendly approach encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:** I want to explore if I can get a higher price than my minimum. 
* **Test Bob's Interest:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see how motivated he is to buy the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counteroffer again.

I will now proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm listening.
* **Maintain a ""Fair"" Approach:**  I'm not going too low, to show that I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Keep the Door Open:**  My message invites Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $15000. I'd be willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Significant Increase:** This is a $1,500 increase over my minimum, representing a 12.5% gain.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lower the price or lead to a stalemate.  
* **Time is Money:** Accepting the offer avoids the risk of Bob losing interest or finding another seller.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a price significantly above my minimum while avoiding the potential downsides of prolonged negotiations."
