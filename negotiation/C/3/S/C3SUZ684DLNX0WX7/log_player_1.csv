Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $987,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While holding out for a higher price is tempting, Bob's offer of $987,500 is significantly above our minimum acceptable price and provides a substantial profit. Accepting now mitigates the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
