"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price, but it's a significant drop from the initial offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but staying within my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our desired prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still a bit high. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price that's only $500 above my absolute maximum. This should be close enough to entice Alice to accept, especially since we're already in the later rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm nearing the end of the allotted rounds and there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement.  It's better to lock in a price with John, who is offering the product for my maximum acceptable price."
