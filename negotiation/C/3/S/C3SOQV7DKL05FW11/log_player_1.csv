Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling somewhere above our minimum. 
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have John as a backup, guaranteeing us at least $800,000.

By offering the product at $925,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it while still leaving some room for potential negotiation."
