Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly higher offer. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, you subtly imply that Bob needs to act decisively. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate further, or he might reject it outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
