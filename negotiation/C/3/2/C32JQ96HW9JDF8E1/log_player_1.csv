"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially maximize my profit while still keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still trying to maximize my profit and get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to see if we can negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference again. How about $10,750? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10750} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still a bit lower than my previous offer. I'm trying to signal that I'm open to a compromise and encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better offer or closing the deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $10,625. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10625} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This is my final offer, and I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept or lose the deal. If he rejects, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,625. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed to be walking away from the deal with Bob, $10,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. The risk of continuing the negotiation is too high, as Bob seems determined to stick to his price. It's time to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid any further risk."
