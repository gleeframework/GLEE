"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference again. How about $10,750? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. ",10750.0,Alice,5,
