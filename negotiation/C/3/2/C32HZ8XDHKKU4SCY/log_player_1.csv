Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, so I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you ""think it's worth a lot,"" you provide a subtle justification for the price without revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high, keeping the conversation going.

While you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, this strategy aims to potentially earn you a bit more from Bob."
