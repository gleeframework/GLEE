"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for your product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1550000?  This price reflects the product's value while also being a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
