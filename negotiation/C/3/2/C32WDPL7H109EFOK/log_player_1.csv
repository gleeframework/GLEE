Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers great value and you'll be very satisfied with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. There's a chance he might value some unstated aspect of the product (like urgency or convenience) higher than the base value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $150 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than the $120 guarantee from John.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly rather than overthinking it.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price."
