Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is well above his budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make a compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still $2,000 above what he's willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still only able to offer $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can go. Let me know if you're willing to accept this."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $13000. I can offer it to you for $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $1,500 above what he's willing to pay. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice.  It's best to buy the product from John for $12,000 and avoid the possibility of a higher price with Alice."
