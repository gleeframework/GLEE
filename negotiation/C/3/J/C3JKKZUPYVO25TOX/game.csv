"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make a compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14000, but I'm still only able to offer $13000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can go. Let me know if you're willing to accept this.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $13000. I can offer it to you for $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
