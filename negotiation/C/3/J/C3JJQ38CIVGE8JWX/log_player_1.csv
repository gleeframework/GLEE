"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay that amount. This sets a strong baseline and leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's too risky to accept his offer when I have a guaranteed higher price with John. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm aiming to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties. I'm also mindful that I have 10 rounds to close the deal and  I don't want to miss an opportunity to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and I am not desperate for a quick sale. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a more favorable price.  I still have John as a backup buyer, providing a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, to $1,050,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above his perceived value. I'm hoping to reach a compromise where we both feel like we've gotten a good deal.  I'm also aware that I have limited rounds left and need to find a way to close the deal with either Bob or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I have John as a guaranteed buyer, and I'm not desperate to close this deal quickly. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering $1,025,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's current offer. I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while still ensuring a profit for myself. With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to reach an agreement before having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. However, with only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. I will reject Bob's offer, hoping to secure a higher price in the next round.  If we can't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final offer. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering Bob's perceived value and my guaranteed offer from John.  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
