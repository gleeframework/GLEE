"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum budget of $150, it's a good deal. Accepting the offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John."
