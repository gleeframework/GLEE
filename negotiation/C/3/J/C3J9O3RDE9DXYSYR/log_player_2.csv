# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. Considering the product's intrinsic worth and potential ROI, I'm proposing a revised price of $900,000. This feels like a balanced compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  Although it's a slight improvement from the previous offer, Bob is aiming to spend no more than $800,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a price closer to his target."

This price would allow me to proceed with the purchase and still stay within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
