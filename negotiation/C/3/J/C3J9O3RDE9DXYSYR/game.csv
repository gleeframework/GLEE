"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $875,000 represents a fair price, considering both our interests. This price would allow me to proceed with the purchase and still stay within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
