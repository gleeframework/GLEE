"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $14,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

``` 
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $14,500 is a significant profit above your minimum of $15,000.
* **Stronger Position:** You've negotiated Bob up from $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away, leaving you with the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
