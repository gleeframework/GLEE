"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to spend more when you have a better option available."
