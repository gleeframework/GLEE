{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's much too early to accept Alice's offer. You can likely get a much better price.  Let's see what kind of counteroffer Alice is willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

Let's start low and see if we can get Alice to budge.  $300,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still a decent amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price, but $450,000 is still more than I'd like to pay. I'll try a counteroffer and see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

Let's try a slightly higher counteroffer than before, but still significantly lower than Alice's offer.  We're making progress, so hopefully this gets us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice seems to be stuck at a price range that's still too high. We can probably squeeze a little more out of her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

Let's try a counteroffer that's closer to her last offer, but still a little lower. Hopefully this will be enough to get a deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $500,000 is a good price, it's still quite a bit more than I'd like to pay. Let's try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

I'm going to try a counteroffer that's halfway between my last offer and Alice's offer. Hopefully, this is enough to get Alice to agree, but if not, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems to be unwilling to budge any further. It's getting too close to my limit, and I don't want to risk wasting any more time. It's time to go with John's offer, even though it's more expensive, to guarantee I get the product."
