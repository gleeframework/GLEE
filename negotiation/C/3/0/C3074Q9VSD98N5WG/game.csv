"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident its value justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is truly worth.  To show you I'm serious about reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
