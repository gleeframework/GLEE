``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the product's value and using friendly language.
* **Strategy:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up in price. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his response. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.

**Explanation:**

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,280,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,280,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I am willing to come down to $1,320,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant reduction from my original asking price.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1320000}
```

* **Message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob and highlighting the fact that I'm making a significant compromise. 
* **Strategy:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,320,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,280,000 again, as I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the wire with only two rounds left. Bob hasn't budged from his last offer, and I'm unwilling to drop below my minimum price.  The risk of continuing negotiations is too high.  I'm not confident that Bob will change his mind, and I risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.

* **Selling to John:**  At this point, selling to John is the most logical choice. It guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and secures a sale.  

* **Strategy:** While it's disappointing to not get a higher price, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale over potentially losing a deal with Bob and having to accept his last offer."
