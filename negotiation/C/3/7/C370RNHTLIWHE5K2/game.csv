"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immense value in.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 reflects the true value I see in this product, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
