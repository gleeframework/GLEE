"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob starts by offering $12,500, which is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still within Bob's comfort zone.
* **Motivation:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product, suggesting a willingness to negotiate, but also establishes a firm price point. 
* **Potential:** This offer leaves room for negotiation in future rounds if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob has already successfully negotiated a lower price, so there's a good chance he can get closer to his desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting the offer means continuing to negotiate, but there's also the risk that Alice might not budge further or that the negotiations could drag on. However, the potential savings of $1,500 outweigh the risks."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $13,500. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and Bob's preferred price.
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates Bob's interest and emphasizes fairness, making the offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Strategic positioning:**  $13,000 leaves room for potential negotiation in the next round if needed, without exceeding Bob's budget."
