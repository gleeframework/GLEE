"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit too high at $13,500. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase.",13000.0,Bob,4,
