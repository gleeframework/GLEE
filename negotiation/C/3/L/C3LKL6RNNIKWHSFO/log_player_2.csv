"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is an exceptional deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John.  It makes the most financial sense to accept her offer."
