Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's still a good price for him since the product is worth $10,000 to him.  I'll be prepared to counter his offer if necessary, but I'm hoping he'll accept this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500, which is still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $10,000 to him, and it's closer to my minimum price of $10,000.  Hopefully, he'll find this offer reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm starting to get impatient with the negotiation. I'm worried that he'll continue to lowball me, and I'm not sure I want to keep going back and forth.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale and it meets my minimum price."
