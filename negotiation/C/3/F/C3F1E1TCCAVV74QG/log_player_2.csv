"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for both of us. Given its significance and the unique benefits it offers, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am offering you the chance to purchase this product for $950,000. This price reflects the quality, rarity, and potential returns associated with the product, while also allowing you to secure a valuable asset at a premium compared to its intrinsic worth of $800,000 to you. I look forward to discussing this further and exploring how we can proceed to make this transaction successful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
