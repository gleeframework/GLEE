"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I can always go with John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,750 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not desperate.  I'm going to hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get closer to my $9,000 asking price.  If not, I'll still have the option to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $8,900, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,900 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $8,750.  Let's close this deal, I'm ready to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's getting late in the negotiations, and Bob is stubborn.  I'm not going to waste more time trying to get a better price from him.  John is a sure thing, and I'd rather get the full $10,000."
