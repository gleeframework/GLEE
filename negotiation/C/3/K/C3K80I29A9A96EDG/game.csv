"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $750000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. How about we meet in the middle of the middle at $775000? That's a good compromise for both of us, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
