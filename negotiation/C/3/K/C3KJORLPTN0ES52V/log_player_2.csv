"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a deal that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  He's willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so there's a potential for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit and represents a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer means getting the product for $1,350,000, which is still lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and leaves room for potential profit.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away altogether outweighs the potential savings at this point."
