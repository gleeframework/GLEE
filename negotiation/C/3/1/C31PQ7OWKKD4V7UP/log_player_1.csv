Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $13,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My message explicitly mentions that the price is negotiable, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to work with him. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I am aware that I have John as a backup buyer, but I want to explore maximizing my profit with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value in the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine. While it's higher than his initial statement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you consider $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down significantly from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that is above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to stretch his budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer keeps me in a strong negotiating position. If Bob accepts, I get a price significantly higher than his initial offer. If he rejects, I can gauge his willingness to move further and consider my alternative option (selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, which is still below your asking price but closer to what I'm comfortable spending. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more in another round, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees I make my minimum profit and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
