"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and it's a fair price for its worth to me. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, given its value. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $850,000 is significantly less than what I'm seeking, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,025,000. It's still a good deal for you given the product's value, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get closer to our desired outcome. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too far below my target. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground and finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your desired price, but $975,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to make a deal without me going over my budget. Let's work together to find a solution.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $925,000 is still too far from my ideal price.  However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. My final offer is $950,000.  If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll be forced to look elsewhere. ",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $937,500, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction.",937500.0,Bob,8,
