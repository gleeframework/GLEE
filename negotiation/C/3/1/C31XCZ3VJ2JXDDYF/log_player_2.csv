"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and it's a fair price for its worth to me. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, given its value. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $850,000 is significantly less than what I'm seeking, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,025,000. It's still a good deal for you given the product's value, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step closer to his target price, it's still too high. He's better off trying to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice closer to his price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get closer to our desired outcome. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too far below my target. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal. He's also relatively close to his alternative price from John, so he has some leverage in this negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your desired price, but $975,000 is still too high for me.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $925,000 is still too far from my ideal price.  However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. My final offer is $950,000.  If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll be forced to look elsewhere.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
