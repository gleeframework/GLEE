"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could you meet me in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
