"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's original asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $8,500, which is still a good deal for Alice as it's above her minimum price of $8,000. This counteroffer is also within my budget and gives me some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum threshold of $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John for my desired price.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
