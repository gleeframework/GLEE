"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. Given the value of the product, I propose a price of $875,000. This is higher than your offer but still below the product's full value. I believe this could be a fair compromise that allows us to move forward.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $850,000, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the value and benefits of the product, I'm proposing a price of $862,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and a decrease from your latest proposal. I hope this figure can help us reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",862500.0,Alice,5,
