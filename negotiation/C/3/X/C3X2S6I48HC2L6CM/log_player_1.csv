{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point. It's a significant profit for me, while still being less than the product's value to Bob. This allows for potential negotiation and a good chance of a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $7,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice, and I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we try $7,750? That's a significant move on my end while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,750 is closer to what I want, it's still not enough.  John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is more than Bob's offer. It's time to move on and sell to John."
