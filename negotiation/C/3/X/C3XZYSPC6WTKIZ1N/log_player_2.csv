Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

This counteroffer is another step towards Alice's price, but still leaves room for her to come down a bit.  With only a few rounds left, it's time to see if we can get a deal."

Alice is clearly not willing to come down much further, and we're running out of rounds. At this point, it's best to buy from John to secure the product at our desired price."
