Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is certainly a respectable offer, it's a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000 to make this deal work.  This price still reflects the value and potential of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,400,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
