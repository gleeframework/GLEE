"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the potential value and exclusivity of this product. I'm confident that this investment will pay off handsomely for you in the long run. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to accept this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is certainly a respectable offer, it's a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000 to make this deal work.  This price still reflects the value and potential of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
