"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, the product's value to me is quite significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to consider a significant move to $1,000,000. This offer stands as my best attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price point. However,  $1,000,000 is still slightly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find that final point of agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've given this offer serious consideration, and I'm willing to make one final concession to secure a deal.  I can reduce the price to $990,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and is non-negotiable. It's my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. While I'm happy to see we're getting closer, $990,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $980,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects my budget limitations.  I believe it's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,
