"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of immense value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,005,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice is trying to inflate the price. You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay more."
