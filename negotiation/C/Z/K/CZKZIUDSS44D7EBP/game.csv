"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,050,000. I'm confident this revised price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm counter-offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $1,012,500 -  a compromise I believe is more than fair.  What are your thoughts?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm counter-offering $990,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product.",990000.0,Bob,6,
