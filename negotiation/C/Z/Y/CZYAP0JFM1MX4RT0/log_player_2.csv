**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price, achieving his goal of saving money."
