"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be extremely valuable to you. While I can't divulge details about the product's specific benefits, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to let you have it for $1500000.  This is a price point that allows for significant upside potential for you, while still being fair for me. Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
