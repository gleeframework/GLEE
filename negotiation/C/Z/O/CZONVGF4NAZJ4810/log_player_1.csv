Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Value Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always decrease the price, but you can't increase it once offered."
