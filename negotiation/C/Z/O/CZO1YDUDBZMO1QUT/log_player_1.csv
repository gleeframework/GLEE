Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a great product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I value the product at. While John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, I still have 8 rounds to try and get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds to try and get closer to my desired price with Bob. It's still better than selling to John, but I'm not desperate.  I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still a bit higher than $1,250,000.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,275,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to stay within your budget and me to get a price closer to my value."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. How about we meet at $1225000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,225,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still have 4 rounds to try and get closer to my desired price with Bob. It's still better than selling to John, but I'm not desperate.  I'll try to push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,225,000.  Let's split the difference one last time. How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in buying the product from you, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1250000. How about we meet at $1220000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob is still significantly below my desired price. While I could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely I'll get closer to my target, and I risk getting stuck with a deal that's not in my best interest. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is closer to my value for the product."
