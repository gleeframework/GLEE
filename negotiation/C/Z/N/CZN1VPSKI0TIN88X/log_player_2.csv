It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very clearly comfortable negotiating around the $7,200 mark and unlikely to go much lower. At this point, the potential savings of a few dollars are outweighed by the risk of her increasing her price or the frustration of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price that meets our needs."
