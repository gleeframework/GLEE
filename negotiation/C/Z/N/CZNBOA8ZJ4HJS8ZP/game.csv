"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 would be fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the best price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to explore other options if we can't meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, as I mentioned before. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
