"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. How about $950,000?  That's still a good profit for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're serious about the product, I think this is a fair price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I think we're very close.  $975,000 is still a bit out of my price range, though.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000? I believe this is still a good price for you, and it's the maximum I can afford.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we've been over this price already. I'm not willing to go back to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $950,000, which is $962,500. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it or walk away.",962500.0,Alice,7,
