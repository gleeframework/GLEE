Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we want to secure the highest possible price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" motivates Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal. 

**The Goal:**

The aim is to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer ($1,000,000) while still remaining attractive enough for Bob to accept."
