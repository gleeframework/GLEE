Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob is still significantly underselling the product's worth to both of us. We're getting closer to my fallback option, but I'm willing to hold out a bit longer."

Bob is getting very close to my fallback price with John.  While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's risky. He's been very consistent in his incremental increases. It's not worth the risk of him stalling out below $800,000.  Selling to John guarantees a good outcome."
