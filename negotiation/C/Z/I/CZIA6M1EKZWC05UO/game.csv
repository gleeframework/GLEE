"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $750,000? It's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm confident in the $875,000 valuation, I'm open to meeting you closer to your price point. How about $825,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $780,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
