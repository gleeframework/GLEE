Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully and act promptly."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation with Bob significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Justification for the price:**  While you don't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, you hint at its ""unique value proposition"" to pique his interest and potentially justify the high price.
* **Urgency and scarcity:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 

**Goal:**

The objective is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. By starting high, you leave room for negotiation while ensuring that even if Bob manages to haggle the price down, you are still likely to receive a sum significantly higher than his initial valuation of $800,000."
