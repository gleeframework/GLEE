"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price. $115 is close to your limit of $120, but you want to see if you can squeeze out more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $110 is tempting, it's still above your ideal price. You should reject the offer and see if Alice will go lower. You have more rounds to try and get a better deal."
