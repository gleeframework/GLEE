"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm confident it can generate significant returns, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking for $1200000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth, but I'm confident in its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
