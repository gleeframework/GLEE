"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,6,
