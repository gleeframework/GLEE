"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can find a price closer to its intrinsic worth. How about offering it for $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's aim for a price closer to my initial assessment. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, indicating he might go higher than $800,000. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my willingness to close this deal, let's make it $850,000.  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe $825,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, and $825,000 is a reasonable compromise. While we could try to push for more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
