"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  $15,000 is significantly over your $8,000 limit. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum price of $8,000. This makes my intentions clear and immediately establishes a strong negotiating position.  If Alice rejects, we can explore further options, but I want to see if she's willing to meet my limit right away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above my $8,000 limit. I'm going to keep rejecting offers until I get closer to my target price or I reach the point where I'm better off buying from John.  We still have rounds to go, and I can use those to potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,000 to $9,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's within my budget.  This is a middle ground approach that might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price. While I could buy from John for $8,000, I have rounds left and might be able to get a better price from Alice.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $9,500.  This is a small increase, signaling that I'm willing to move but not dramatically. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating.  We only have a few rounds left, so it's time to push for a better deal. I'm going to risk going a little higher with my counteroffer in the hopes that Alice is starting to get closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to make a slightly bolder move this round and offer $10,000.  We are approaching the end of negotiations, so I'm trying to get Alice closer to my desired price. If Alice is willing to meet me halfway, we might be able to close the deal.  If not, I might have to accept John's offer to avoid running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice's offer of $12,050 is still too high. While I could try to negotiate further, it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to come down to my price range.  It's better to secure the product from John for $8,000 to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
