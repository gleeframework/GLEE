"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, but it allows for room to negotiate. I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit while also leaving some wiggle room for Bob to make a counteroffer. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to give up on getting a better price just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above the minimum I'm willing to accept. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation, while also demonstrating my commitment to selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a profit above the minimum I'm willing to accept and guarantees a sale without the risk of further rejection."
