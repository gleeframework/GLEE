"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's the first round, and Alice's offer is quite close to my maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $145 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation. This approach aims to determine Alice's willingness to lower the price and provide insight into her potential bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $110 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice moved down a fair bit in price, which is a good sign.  I still think there's room to negotiate, so I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both parties. It's a reasonable price point, considering Alice's previous offer and my budget."
