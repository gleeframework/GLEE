"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. This product holds immense value for us at $1,200,000, but I understand the importance of finding the right balance for all parties involved. Therefore, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase this product for you at $1,100,000. This is a special opportunity that I hope will be beneficial for both of us. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the transaction. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price, you know the product is only worth $1,000,000 to her. This suggests there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price closer to her valuation to avoid losing the sale altogether."
