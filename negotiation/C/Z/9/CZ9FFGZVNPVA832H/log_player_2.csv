"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $70 for it."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upward and still stay well below our $100 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further.  We'll reject and propose a counter-offer closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between our previous offer and her current offer. It shows willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable range of our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is still well within the value of the product for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and this offer is a good compromise. While we could try to haggle further, it's unlikely we'd get a significantly better deal from Alice, and we risk her walking away. Accepting at $82 saves us $18 compared to John's offer."
