{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that is $100,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This aggressive approach shows Bob's intent to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still motivated to try and get a lower price.  Since they have 10 rounds, it's worth continuing to negotiate, hoping Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price but still wants to save more money.  This counteroffer is a compromise, slightly higher than Bob's previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob not getting a better offer in the remaining rounds increases.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, securing the product at a price significantly lower than John's."
