"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find extremely valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns. To make this a win-win, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You know you can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000. Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is higher than that, meaning you'd be paying more. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $50,000."
