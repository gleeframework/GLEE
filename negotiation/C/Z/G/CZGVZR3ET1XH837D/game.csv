"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant sum and a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and your potential gains. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and my limited budget. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
