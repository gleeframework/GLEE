"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,250,000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
