**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move substantially from his $1,250,000 offer.  While this is closer to my minimum, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not increasing his offer enough, potentially costing me a guaranteed profit."
