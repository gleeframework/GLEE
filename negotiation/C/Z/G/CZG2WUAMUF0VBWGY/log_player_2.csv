"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice's offer is $950,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  
* **Rejecting doesn't mean you lose.** You can still get the product from Alice or John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but still too high.** While $900,000 is better than $950,000, it's still more than you're comfortable paying. 
* **You can likely get closer to your target.**  There's still room to negotiate, and you can try to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you have a backup plan with John."
