Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) creates a sense of urgency and value. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"":**  By mentioning another offer, I incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is a negotiation. There's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer, leading to further discussion."
