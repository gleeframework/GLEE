"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $800,000 to her, and she's asking $950,000, leaving a significant profit margin for her.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to profit from this purchase. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $950,000 to $900,000, which is progress. However,  $900,000 is still significantly more than the product is worth to her. I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer. $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground here.  "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $887,500. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $887,500, which is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer. This is a good compromise, and I'm happy with this price. It's well below the $1,000,000 I'd pay to John, so accepting this offer is the best option for me."
