"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but $9,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're not willing to go lower than $11,250. However,  I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875.  This would be a significant compromise from both of our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach an agreement.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,875. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you at $11,125. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11125.0,Alice,7,
