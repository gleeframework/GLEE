"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  It also shows him that I value the product and am not desperate to sell it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell right away. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, but still aim for more than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering the price a bit to $13,500. This is a reasonable compromise, showing flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and we are now in round 4.  Considering I could sell to John for $12,000, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure a better price.  It's a good balance of earning more than John's offer and not risking further negotiation rounds that could result in a lower price."
