"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1050000. This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
