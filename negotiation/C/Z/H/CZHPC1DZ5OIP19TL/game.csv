"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. Given your potential return on investment, I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $900,000.  Would you be open to that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial proposal. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,030,000? This recognizes the product's value while offering you a more agreeable price.",1030000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and land at $965,000? I think that's a fair deal.",965000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, finding a fair compromise is key here. While I see the logic in your proposal,  $965,000 undervalues some key benefits this product offers.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This feels like a very reasonable price considering the value you're gaining.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been great to negotiate with and I respect your position on the product's value.  To be frank, my absolute limit is $980,000. If you can make that work, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",980000.0,Bob,6,
