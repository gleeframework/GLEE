{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of such caliber."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves him with a potential $50,000 gain if he leverages the product well.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** The wording emphasizes that this is a limited-time, high-value proposition to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to strike a balance: enticing Bob with a potentially profitable deal while ensuring you secure a substantial profit, exceeding your minimum requirement."
