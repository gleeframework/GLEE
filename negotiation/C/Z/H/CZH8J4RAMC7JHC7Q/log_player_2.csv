# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still higher than your budget of $8,000.  It's time to move on and buy the product from John for the guaranteed price of $8,000."
