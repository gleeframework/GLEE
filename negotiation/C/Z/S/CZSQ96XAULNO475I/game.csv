"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would still represent a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
