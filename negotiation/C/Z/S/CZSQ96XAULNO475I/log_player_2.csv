"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would still represent a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.**  $875,000 is less than Bob's $1,000,000 limit.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited.**  Bob's initial counteroffer was already quite low.  It's likely Alice won't go much lower.
* **Risk of losing the deal.**  If Bob rejects this offer and tries to negotiate further, Alice might walk away.  John is still an option, but it's a higher price. 

Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to get the product at a decent price without risking a breakdown in negotiations or having to pay John's higher price."
