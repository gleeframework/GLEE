"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You should definitely buy from John to save $9,000."
