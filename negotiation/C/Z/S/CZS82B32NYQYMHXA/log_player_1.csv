Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $70.  While it's tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $77.50. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $77.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $77.50 is still a bit low. How about $82.50? It's a fair compromise that's closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $79.50, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $79.50 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds.  It's not worth the risk of going lower and potentially losing the deal.  I'll sell to John for $80 and be guaranteed a fair price."
