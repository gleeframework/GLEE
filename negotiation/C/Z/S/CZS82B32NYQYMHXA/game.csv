,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you consider that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $77.50. Can you consider that price?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $77.50 is still a bit low. How about $82.50? It's a fair compromise that's closer to my target.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $79.50, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",79.5,Bob,6,
