"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $1,125,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at that price.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
