# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still more than you need to pay. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. If Alice doesn't budge, you have the fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000."
