"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start with a price of $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $100, knowing I can always come down if needed. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  $100 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your interest, $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $85 is closer, I'm still looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm ready to offer $80.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already established my willingness to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
