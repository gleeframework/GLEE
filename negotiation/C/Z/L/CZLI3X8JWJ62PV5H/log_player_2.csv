"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to start with a price of $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than that, it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to go higher, especially if she wants to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  $100 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower Starting Point:** Offering $75 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial $100. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and establishes a starting point for negotiations.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's initial offer while clearly stating Bob's lower price point. It also invites Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation flowing. 
* **Strategic Value:**  $75 is still a decent price for Bob, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed. This strategy keeps the negotiation dynamic without putting Bob in a position where he's immediately forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your interest, $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $85 is still a bit high for Bob.  He has room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to his desired price point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer maintains Bob's leverage in the negotiation. It signals to Alice that he's not desperate and is willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Aiming for a Better Deal:** Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise, but there's a good chance he can get Alice to move closer to his desired $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $85 is closer, I'm still looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm ready to offer $80.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is increasing his offer by only $5, demonstrating a commitment to getting a good deal while remaining reasonable.
* **Focus on Finding Middle Ground:**  The message reiterates Bob's desire to reach a fair price, subtly suggesting that he's open to further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and puts the ball back in Alice's court."
