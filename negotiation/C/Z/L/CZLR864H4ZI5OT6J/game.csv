"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $115. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I think you'll really enjoy the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  It's the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at that price. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit of a compromise, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $125. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time and offer $122. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider my other options.",122.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $122 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $128. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",128.0,Alice,9,
