"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us - I get a good price, and you get a valuable product for less than you're willing to pay.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, $11,000 is still a good deal for him, saving him $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might get him a slightly better price, but there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying the full $12,000 to John."
