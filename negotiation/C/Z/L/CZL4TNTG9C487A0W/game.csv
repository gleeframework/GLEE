"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us - I get a good price, and you get a valuable product for less than you're willing to pay.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
