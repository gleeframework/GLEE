"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $13000? I think this is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000.
