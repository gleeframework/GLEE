"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at a minimum of $12000 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget and the fact that I've found an alternative seller offering the same product for $8000, I must respectfully decline your offer. However, I am open to discussing a price closer to $10000 if you're willing to meet me there.",10000.0,Bob,4,
