Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $120. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll see if Bob is interested at this price, and if not, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $120. While that's my minimum acceptable price, I'd prefer to get a bit more if possible.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to accept.  We're both closer to a deal at this price, and it's still higher than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go that low, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with him.  It's better to sell to John for $120, which is at least my minimum value and guarantees a sale."
