"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $11,500 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind, but I'm willing to go down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as this is the absolute lowest I can go.",15000.0,Alice,5,
