"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging to make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I won't accept it, and I will counteroffer in the next round.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $120 for this fantastic product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm making a counteroffer that's still above my minimum, but significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm also restating the value of the product to try and influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could we settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's closer, but I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm still not ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is just not feasible for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This is a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a price that's the average of my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product again to try and persuade Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but I need to stay closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is the closest he's come to my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting his offer will at least guarantee a sale and a decent profit."
