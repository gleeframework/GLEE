"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $13,500. This is a fair starting point, as it's slightly above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a price higher than his minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product is valuable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Bob's valuation of the product, but I won't go lower. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
