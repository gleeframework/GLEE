"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still a bit too high. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $875,000 is a good start, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $862,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $862500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go down to $870000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now only $20,000 apart.  It's getting close to my target price, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal with Alice.  While I'd still prefer to pay less, it's not worth risking the deal to try to negotiate further. Accepting Alice's offer saves me $130,000 compared to buying from John."
