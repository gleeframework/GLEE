"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $875000 is a good start, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $850000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $862500?  This feels like a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $862500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go down to $870000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
