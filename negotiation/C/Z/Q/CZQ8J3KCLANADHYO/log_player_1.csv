Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $875000 is a good start, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $850000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $862500?  This feels like a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.
