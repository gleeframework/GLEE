{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good price, I can still try to negotiate a better deal. I'm going to reject her initial offer and see if I can get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $85 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to Alice, and I'm still within my budget. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that Alice may be willing to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still asking for a price higher than I'm comfortable with. While it's better than her initial offer, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get her down to a price closer to $85."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $87. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to what I believe it's worth. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a compromise and accept the offer."
