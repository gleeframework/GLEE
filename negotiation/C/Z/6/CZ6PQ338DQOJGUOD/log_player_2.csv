"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially leading to a lower price and saving Bob money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer offers a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable value of $800,000. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and encourages further negotiation while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000, it's still higher than my ideal price. By rejecting this offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially achieve a price closer to my target, potentially saving myself $150,000 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,050,000. It shows a willingness to move closer to her price, but still leaves some room for negotiation,  keeping the price within my budget while hopefully finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a significant amount more than my desired price and my previous counteroffer.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much further, and continued negotiation might only lead to a slightly lower price.  

At this point, I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and it's starting to look like reaching a mutually agreeable price with Alice might take even more rounds. Given the urgency of my need for the product, it's more efficient to buy from John at $1,200,000, even though it's slightly above my preferred price. I can avoid the potential of further negotiation and save time by simply buying from John."
