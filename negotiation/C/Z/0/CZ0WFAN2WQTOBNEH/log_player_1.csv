Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll negotiate.  This allows room for a compromise that still gets me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $105, which is still above my minimum threshold but closer to Bob's offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while also trying to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $95 is still a good profit for me and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher.  It's better to secure the sale than risk losing him altogether and having to sell to John for $100."
