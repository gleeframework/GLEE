{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already in profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to negotiate a price closer to his value.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  A high initial offer can put pressure on Bob to make the first move and potentially lower his counteroffer.

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you would like to get.  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,200 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to consider $8,800? This product is truly top-notch, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad to hear that the product is top-notch, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is still not your ideal price, it's significantly closer to your desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's important to recognize the value of securing a sale, even if it's not at your ideal price."
