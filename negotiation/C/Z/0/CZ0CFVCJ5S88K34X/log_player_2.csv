# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my [product name] at a price that's a steal compared to its value to you. I know it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a significant discount. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
