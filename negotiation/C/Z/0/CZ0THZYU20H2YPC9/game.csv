"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, considering the value you place on the product is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
