Let's negotiate. Alice's offer is still considerably higher than my budget and John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, considering the value you place on the product is $8,000. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not willing to meet her at $9,000. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to my budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is holding firm, and while $8,500 isn't terrible, I know I can get it for $8,000 from John. It's not worth haggling further for a small potential saving."
