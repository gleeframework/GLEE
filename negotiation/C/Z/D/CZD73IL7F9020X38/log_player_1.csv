"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $80 to Alice, so accepting Bob's offer of $75 would result in a loss. Selling to John for $80 is a better option, but it's worth seeing if Bob will come closer to Alice's minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
