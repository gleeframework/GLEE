Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob only values the product at $80,  it's best to start with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering the product at $125 ensures a profit even if Bob manages to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, it's worth aiming higher initially."
