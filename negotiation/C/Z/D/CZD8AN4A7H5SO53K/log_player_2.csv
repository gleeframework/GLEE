"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if you can get the price even lower.  You have a significant buffer between your maximum value and Alice's offer, allowing for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $10,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and leaves you with a decent profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is just a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? That leaves us both with a good deal, and I believe it's still within your budget.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than John's price of $15,000, and you still have a decent amount of room below your maximum budget of $15,000.  Accepting this offer saves you money and avoids further negotiation rounds."
