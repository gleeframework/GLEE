{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's below Bob's estimated value, making it attractive to him.
* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a substantial profit, and it leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **It sets the tone:** This opening offer signals you're confident in the product's value and willing to negotiate, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $10000. It's still a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and leaves you with a decent profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is still a decent profit, it's not ideal.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is just a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? That leaves us both with a good deal, and I believe it's still within your budget.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
