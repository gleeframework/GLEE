"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still a little tight on budget. I'm happy to pay $14,500. If you're willing to consider that, I think we can finalize the deal. ",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $15,500? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product!",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my budget.  However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $15,250. That's a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",15250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go above $16,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,750. It's a compromise that works for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",15750.0,Alice,7,
