"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's always better to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds to do so, and you can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your best possible price and is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept it immediately, it establishes a clear starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still too high. You still have 7 rounds left to negotiate, and there's a chance you can get a lower price.  Furthermore, you have the fallback option of purchasing from John at a price that is significantly lower than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget.  This offer also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You have 5 rounds left, and you can potentially get a lower price.  While buying from John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, you're still close to closing a deal with Alice at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. It's still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to counter further. This strategy aims to reach a middle ground without going above your maximum price. With 4 rounds remaining, you have time to see if Alice will budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your desired price, and you've already spent several rounds negotiating. There is a good chance you won't be able to get a lower price, and with only three rounds remaining, you risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether. Buying from John at $1,000,000 is still an option, but this offer is a good compromise that gets you the product at a reasonable price."
