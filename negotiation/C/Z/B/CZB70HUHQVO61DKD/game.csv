"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within a tight budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to sell it for at least $9,500. That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize this deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider my revised offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,
