"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob has made it clear that $12,000 is his maximum price.  It's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer means losing out on a potential $3,000. It's more profitable to sell to John at our minimum acceptable price."
