Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for you, considering your value for it, and leaves some room for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
