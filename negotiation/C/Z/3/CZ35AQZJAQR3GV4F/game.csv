,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you offering this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $950,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $980,000, which is a bit above your latest offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  I'm still willing to pay $950,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $980,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  However, I'm really not comfortable going above $950,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with another option. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made a significant concession by offering $975,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a free consultation to sweeten the deal. But as for the price, I'm sticking with $975,000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,9,
