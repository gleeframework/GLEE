{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my budget, even with the added extras. While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to go over my target price. I've already made multiple counteroffers, and Alice seems unwilling to budge further.  Therefore, I'll move forward with purchasing the product from John for $800,000, which is well within my budget and aligns with my goal of saving as much money as possible."
