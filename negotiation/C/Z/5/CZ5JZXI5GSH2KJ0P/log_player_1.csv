{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than that! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've set your minimum at $10,000, so this offer gives you some room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for him to see this as a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer.  There's room to negotiate for a higher price. You'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and you still get the product for less than your estimated value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $11,000, Alice. While that's a fair point, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $10,750 isn't as high as you initially hoped, it's still a good deal considering your minimum was $10,000. You've been able to secure a price that's closer to your desired range, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a higher offer."
