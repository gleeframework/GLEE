"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and you still get the product for less than your estimated value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $11,000, Alice. While that's a fair point, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
