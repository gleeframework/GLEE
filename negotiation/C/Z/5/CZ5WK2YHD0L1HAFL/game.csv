"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  My initial offer is $2,000,000.  I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 to see if we can find common ground. This still leaves me with a decent profit, and it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway, but $1,375,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,625,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,625,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $1,400,000 is still below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to reconsider.",1500000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm starting to get close to my maximum budget, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
