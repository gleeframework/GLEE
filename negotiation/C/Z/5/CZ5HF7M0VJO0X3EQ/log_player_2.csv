"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John.  While $120 is better than $150 for Alice, it's still above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the product for $100 from John, this is the absolute maximum you're willing to pay. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. You can get the product for $100 from John, making it the best option at this point.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a lower price, and it's not worth the risk of potentially getting stuck with a higher price."
