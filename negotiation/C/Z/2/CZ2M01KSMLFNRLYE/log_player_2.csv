"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $120. You can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
