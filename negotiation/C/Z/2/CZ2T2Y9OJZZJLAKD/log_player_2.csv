While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still quite high. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $825,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer on the product at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a final offer of $835,000. This is a good price considering John is selling the product for $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a significant discount."
