Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), I create room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will give me valuable information to inform my next move.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John at $800,000. This knowledge gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's response indicates interest, and his offer is a substantial jump from my initial ask. By rejecting and countering, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Considering the true value of this product, I could come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still offering you a great deal. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, which shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still significantly above my fallback option of $800,000 from John, giving me leverage to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 represents a significant profit margin above my minimum selling price of $800,000. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer to ""split the difference"" suggests he's getting close to his maximum price.  
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation risks pushing Bob away entirely, potentially leading to a missed opportunity. Accepting now secures a very favorable deal."
