"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, I think $900,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from the initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, but that's as high as I can go.  It's a fair deal!",800000.0,Bob,6,
