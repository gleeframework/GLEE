# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
