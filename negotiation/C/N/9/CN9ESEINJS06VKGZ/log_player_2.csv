# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $140 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $120, allowing you to save some money while still getting a great deal. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more expensive than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for his desired price."
