# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and represents a good deal.  It's lower than her initial offer, and I've already secured a better price than what I'd pay from John. Accepting the offer allows me to acquire the product and avoid further negotiation."
