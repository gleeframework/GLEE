Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's too low and doesn't reflect the product's true value. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob or selling to John."

While $1,125,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm determined to get closer to my initial asking price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter again."
