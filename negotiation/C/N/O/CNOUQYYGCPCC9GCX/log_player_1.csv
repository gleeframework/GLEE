Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be very valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $130 is a starting point that aims to:
    * Be significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
    * Be tempting enough for Bob to consider, as it's a discount from my potential sale price to John.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussing the price further, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 
 
This strategy allows me to potentially secure a higher profit than my guaranteed sale while still having John as a safety net."
