"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be very valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $130 is lower than her value for the product, it's still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and John's offer. You'll save money by rejecting her offer and going with John."
