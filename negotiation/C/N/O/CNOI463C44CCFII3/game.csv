"Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget.  I'm very interested in your product but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to reduce the price to $1750000. This reflects a substantial discount, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering your previous offer and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
