Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A price of $110 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me having to accept a price lower than I want.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can potentially get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose out on the opportunity cost."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $100. This is still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $110 to $100.
* **Still above my minimum:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing out on the value of the product.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Further negotiation might only result in a small price increase, and it's not guaranteed to succeed.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:** I can secure a guaranteed profit of $120 by selling to John, which is significantly better than risking further negotiation with Bob."
