Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn a profit significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could accept and make a profit, it's significantly lower than my goal.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but still want to earn a substantial profit. This should give Bob a sense that I'm serious about negotiating while also indicating that his initial offer was too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could accept and make a profit, it's not as high as I'd like. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000.  This is a further compromise but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate but also that his offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,500,000, and since John is willing to pay that, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
