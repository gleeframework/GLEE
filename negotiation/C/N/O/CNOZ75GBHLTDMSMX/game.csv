"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my best offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm prepared to pay $9000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
