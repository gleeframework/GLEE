"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000.

What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $780000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $780000. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $820000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",820000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going above $800000. I've made a very serious offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which is the price I was initially offered by John, the other seller. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
