"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $17,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm choosing to reject the offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. Would you consider $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm choosing to reject the offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can still get a better price, and I'm willing to explore further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $15,500.  This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $15,500. Would you consider $14,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've already reached round 6, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might not result in a price I'm happy with. Additionally, John is willing to pay my minimum price.  To ensure I get a guaranteed $15,000, I'm going to sell the product to John."
