"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $15,500.  This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
