"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do think this product has value, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $120. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle, how about that?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down.  $135 is closer, but still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'll offer $130.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
