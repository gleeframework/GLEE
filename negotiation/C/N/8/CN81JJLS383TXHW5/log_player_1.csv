"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to help build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can't quite go down to $140, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at the higher price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Close to my minimum:**  However, it's getting closer, and I want to see if I can push a bit further.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price. There's still a chance he might come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here! How about we split the difference again and go with $150?  It's my absolute minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  This is my final push to get to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Splitting the difference:** Again, I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing minimum:**  I'm making it clear that this is my absolute minimum, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Fairness appeal:**  I'm appealing to fairness, suggesting that this price is good for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $142? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already at round 6, and Bob is not willing to budge much. 
* **Below my minimum:** $142 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Guaranteed price:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum and a better deal than what Bob is offering.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer in the next round, and I risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  

It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John now rather than risk losing time and potentially a better deal with Bob."
