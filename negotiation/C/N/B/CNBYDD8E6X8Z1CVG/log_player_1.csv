Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I've started with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've made it clear that I'm open to negotiating, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to work with him.
* **Value proposition:** I've mentioned that the product is ""unique"" and hinted at its potential value to Bob. 

This offer is a good starting point as it sets a high price but allows for flexibility during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $15000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
