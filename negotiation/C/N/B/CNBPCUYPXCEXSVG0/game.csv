"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,500? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,250, and that's as close to $11,000 as I can get. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10875.0,Bob,6,
