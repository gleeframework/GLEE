"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1325000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1295000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1295000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm going to make one last offer at $1250000.  This is my absolute maximum, and if we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to explore other options. ",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous offer, which is $1272500. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it.",1272500.0,Alice,7,
