{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm hoping for a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, offering a lower price than my initial offer while still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a solid price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to go that low. I've already rejected his offer twice and it's clear he's not willing to meet me halfway.  While I'd prefer to get more than $1,200,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  John offers a secure sale at my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
