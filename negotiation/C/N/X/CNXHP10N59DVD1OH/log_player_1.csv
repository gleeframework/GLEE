Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000. Can we try $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I originally hoped for, it's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  $10,750 is better than the $10,000 I would get from John."
