Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the benefits the product offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $15,000 is out of my budget range. I would like to propose $12,000 as a potential compromise. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While ideally, I'd want $15,000, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting $12,000 now is a better outcome than risking him walking away and getting stuck with a lower offer later or having to settle for John's $15,000."
