"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal to get it into your hands. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm prepared to come down a little. How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise and still allows me to get a decent price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good price for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
