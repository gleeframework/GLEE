"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my value. Since Bob is only willing to pay $12,000, he'll likely reject this offer. This will set the stage for negotiations and allow me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject this offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aim for a price that's closer to my value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to continue negotiating and potentially lead to a deal that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and I'm not sure how much more I can get from him. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm taking a calculated risk by accepting Bob's offer. However, it's better to secure the deal now than risk losing both Bob and John in the next few rounds."
