I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet either. I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my desired price. While I'd prefer to get a bit more,  I don't want to risk losing out completely.  John's offer is a safe bet, guaranteeing me $1,000,000. I'll sell to John."
