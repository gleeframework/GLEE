Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $950,000 is a good price point for you. However, I need to ensure I get a fair return on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,000,000. This would allow us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has met my maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further, as I can get the same price from John."
