"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I can offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
