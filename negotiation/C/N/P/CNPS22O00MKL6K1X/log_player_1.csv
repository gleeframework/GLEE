{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not selling yourself short and you're starting at a price that makes you feel good about the deal.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for both of you to find a price that works for both parties. 

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a successful negotiation and maximizing your chances of getting a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try to secure a higher price. You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, demonstrating you're willing to negotiate but not settle for the absolute minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come up to $9,000.  This gives you a great price and still allows me to make a profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep the price at or below $8,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum and closer to your initial offer. Accepting his offer ensures you get a decent price for your product.  While there's always the possibility of getting a bit more, the potential for more negotiation is less than the risk of Bob walking away and you having to settle for John's offer."
