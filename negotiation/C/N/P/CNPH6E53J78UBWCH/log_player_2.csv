"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I've valued it at $1,000,000, considering its potential value to you. This price is fair and allows for a significant profit for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer leaves room for negotiation. While $1,000,000 is within your budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to get a price closer to Alice's valuation and save a substantial amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high. How about we settle on $850,000? That feels like a fair price that recognizes its value."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Anchor the negotiation lower:**  Starting significantly below Alice's asking price creates downward pressure on subsequent offers.
* **Appear reasonable:**  While aggressive, the offer is still well above Alice's valuation, suggesting a willingness to make a deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob can still go up slightly if Alice pushes back, while staying well below John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a solid profit for both of us and is closer to my initial valuation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but she's still significantly above her valuation. While she came down in price, it's likely she has room to move further. Rejecting this offer and countering again keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price while staying below John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $950,000 is still a touch higher than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $880,000? I feel that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 880000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** This offer shows a willingness to move closer to Alice's price point but in a measured way.  The increase from $850,000 to $880,000 is small enough to not seem desperate but large enough to signal flexibility.
* **Maintaining a target:**  Bob is still aiming for a price well below $900,000, maximizing potential savings.
* **Time pressure:** As the negotiation continues, there's an increasing risk Alice walks away. This offer tries to strike a balance between getting a good deal and closing the deal."
