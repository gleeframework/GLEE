"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I've valued it at $1,000,000, considering its potential value to you. This price is fair and allows for a significant profit for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high. How about we settle on $850,000? That feels like a fair price that recognizes its value.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a solid profit for both of us and is closer to my initial valuation.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $950,000 is still a touch higher than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $880,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",880000.0,Bob,4,
