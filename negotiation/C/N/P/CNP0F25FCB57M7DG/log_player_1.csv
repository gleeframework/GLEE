"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation, but still ensures a profit for Alice. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $10500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is aiming for a higher price than $10,500, and she has room to negotiate. Even though selling to John is an option, it's not the most profitable choice. Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $11000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10750? That's a fair compromise and would allow me to proceed with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to Alice's desired price point.  While it's still a bit lower than her initial target, it's a good compromise that secures a profit. Selling to John at $10,000 would be less profitable, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer is the best choice in this round."
