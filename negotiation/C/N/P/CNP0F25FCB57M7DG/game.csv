"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $10500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  It's still a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $11000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10750? That's a fair compromise and would allow me to proceed with the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
