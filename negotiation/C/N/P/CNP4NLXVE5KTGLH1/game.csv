"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'd like to counter with $9,500. This would still be a good deal for you, and allows us to both find common ground. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9200.0,Bob,4,
