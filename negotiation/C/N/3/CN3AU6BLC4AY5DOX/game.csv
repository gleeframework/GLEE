"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  While this may seem high, I'm confident its potential benefits will far outweigh the investment.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $800,000? This would allow me to consider your product without exceeding my financial limits.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $800,000.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price we can both agree on. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant discount on the product's true value.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This is a fair deal that reflects the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to reach an agreement. However, I am still hesitant to go beyond my budget. Would it be possible to reconsider the price to $1,250,000? This would bring us closer together and might allow for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
