"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with my highest price, as I want to maximize my earnings. This gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer if he's interested but thinks the price is too high.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe it's quite valuable. Would you consider lowering the price to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low for me. I'd prefer to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option to sell to John for my desired price if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, as I value a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to bridge the gap between my price and Bob's offer.  I'm confident that $140 is a fair price, and I'm expressing willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to offer $135 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'm not in a rush to sell and have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $135 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 137.5} 
```

I'm trying to be flexible and meet Bob halfway with this offer. I'm confident that this price is reasonable, considering my minimum and Bob's offer.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the split, hoping to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with $136 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $136. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $136
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price. It's still above my minimum, and the negotiation has been going on for a while.  I'm going to accept this offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of further counteroffers or reaching a stalemate."
