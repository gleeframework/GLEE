"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is better than her initial offer, Bob is still saving more money by continuing to negotiate. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and he has a backup option with John. There is room for Alice to come down more before Bob needs to consider buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down again.  I'm still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10,000. If you're serious about selling this, I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has successfully negotiated the price down significantly from her initial offer of $12,000.  He is getting a good deal and saving a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John.  While there might be a small chance Alice would come down to $10,000 if he rejected her offer, the risk of losing the deal is not worth it.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, so rejecting it might mean losing the opportunity to buy the product at this price."
