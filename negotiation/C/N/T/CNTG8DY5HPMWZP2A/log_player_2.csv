"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to work with you on a fair price.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high for Bob.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, he should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup some of my initial investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  That's still a good deal for you, given the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still not within Bob's target range.  Bob is determined to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $1,275,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's still a very good deal for you considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to sell or that the price could go back up. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
