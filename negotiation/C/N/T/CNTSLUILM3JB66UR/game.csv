"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll need to move on to other buyers.",11000.0,Alice,5,
