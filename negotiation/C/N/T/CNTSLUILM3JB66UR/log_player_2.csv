"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $12,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get Alice to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.

You are still very close to your limit of $10,000 and it is worth trying to negotiate a little lower. It is possible Alice will come down further in price if you reject her offer again."

You have been negotiating for a while, and you've made it clear that you're not willing to go above $10,875. It seems Alice is firm on her final offer of $11,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to go with that option rather than continue to negotiate and potentially risk missing out on a good deal."
