"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact on your operations, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special price of $12,000. This represents a significant discount compared to the market value, making it an excellent investment for your company. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if there's anything else I can assist you with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price and below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have the backup option of John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her $10,000 value."
