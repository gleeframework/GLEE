"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, I'm confident the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,575,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
