"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $125, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting this offer sets you up to get the best possible price."
