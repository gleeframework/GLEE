Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I consider the minimum ($120), hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $125. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is better than my minimum and closer to my desired price.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
