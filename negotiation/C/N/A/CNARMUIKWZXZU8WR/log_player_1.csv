Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the value of the product but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
