"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a fantastic deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I understand the value of the product but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.
