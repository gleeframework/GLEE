{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 to make this a win-win situation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still have room to negotiate for a better price. I want to see if I can get him closer to my goal of $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth more.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $975,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. To show my willingness to come to an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can only stretch to $990,000. Can you consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price. There are only four rounds left, so I need to be strategic and push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $990,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for a much higher price. I'm going to try one last time to push Bob higher in the next round. If he doesn't budge, I'll go with John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
