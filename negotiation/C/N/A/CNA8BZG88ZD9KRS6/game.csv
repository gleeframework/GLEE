"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 to make this a win-win situation.  This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $975,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. To show my willingness to come to an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can only stretch to $990,000. Can you consider this price?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $990,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me halfway?",995000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been willing to negotiate with you, but $995,000 just isn't enough for me to let this product go. I'm going to have to stick to my previous offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, and if you don't accept, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
