Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is beneficial to me, while still being potentially appealing to Bob.  I'm giving him a little room to negotiate while also ensuring that I get more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get my full asking price, $9,000 is still a decent amount and a good compromise. It's important to be flexible in negotiations, and I think it's worth it to close the deal with Bob rather than risk losing him and ending up with John's $10,000 offer."
