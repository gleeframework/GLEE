Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. I don't want to offer it to Bob for less than this amount.

**The message to Bob is crafted to:**

* **Highlight value:**  Emphasize the product's benefits to Bob, making the price more palatable.
* **Appear fair:**  The phrase ""fair offer"" aims to frame the price positively. 
* **Encourage acceptance:** A strong initial offer can lead to a quicker deal."
