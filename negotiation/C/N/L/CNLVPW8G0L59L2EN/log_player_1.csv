Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately walk away from a potential deal.  I'm also adding a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering $150, my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to go any lower.  At this point, it's more profitable for me to sell to John for $150 than to continue negotiating with Bob."
