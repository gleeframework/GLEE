"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You have no information on the true value of the product to Alice. Accepting her offer at $1,500,000 means you're not saving any money. Since you can get the product from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller offering a better deal."
