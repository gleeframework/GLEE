Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower allows room for negotiation and potential for a quicker sale to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but leaves you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a significant profit, exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to negotiate down slightly while still exceeding your $1,500,000 fallback.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price."
