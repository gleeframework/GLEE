"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $8,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still finding it a bit expensive. How about $7,000?  That feels like a fair price to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
