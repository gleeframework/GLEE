Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a significant profit if he accepts. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that I have other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
