,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the market rate. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, I've had significant interest in this product, and  $1,300,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This reflects the true value and scarcity of what I'm offering.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on this product. I believe this offer reflects the market value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
