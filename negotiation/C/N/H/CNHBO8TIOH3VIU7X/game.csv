"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business.  While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party who is willing to pay $1200000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
