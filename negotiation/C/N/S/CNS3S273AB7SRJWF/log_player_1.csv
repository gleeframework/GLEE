"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I also want to see if he's truly interested in the product, and if he's willing to pay a higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm not going to give up on potentially getting more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him, while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good deal. It's higher than John's offer, and the negotiations seem to be getting close to a final price. Accepting now means I can close the deal and secure a good profit. There's always the risk of further negotiations, but I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely or going through many more rounds."
