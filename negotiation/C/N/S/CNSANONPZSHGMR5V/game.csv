"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is more reasonable for me.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to go with another buyer.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,800 and $8,200. Would you be willing to consider $7,950? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is more reasonable for me.",7950.0,Bob,6,
