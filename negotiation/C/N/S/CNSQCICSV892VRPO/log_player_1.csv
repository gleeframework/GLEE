{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant gain for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $15,000 risks Bob rejecting it outright. This offer strikes a balance between profit and the likelihood of acceptance. 

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, you increase the chances of a successful sale to Bob while still maintaining a healthy profit margin over your alternative with John."
