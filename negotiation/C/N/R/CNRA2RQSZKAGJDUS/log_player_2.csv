It's too expensive, let's see if we can get a better deal."

Let's start with $8,000. That's a significant discount from her initial offer, and hopefully, a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high.  Let's see if we can get closer to my budget with a counteroffer."

We're getting close, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can get a final counter offer in."

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Alice will see it's a fair price for both of us. If she doesn't, I'll happily go with John's deal."
