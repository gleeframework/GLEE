"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob wants to pay. He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $140? It's a fair price that leaves us both happy."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we try $142.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** Alice is now offering $142.50, which is only $2.50 more than Bob's last offer. 
* **Time is ticking:**  Bob has already gone through 4 rounds of negotiation and has limited time remaining.
* **Alternative option:** While buying from John for $150 is an option, it's a worse deal than what Alice is currently offering.

This is a good compromise, allowing Bob to save $7.50 compared to buying from John."
