"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  Would you consider $1,280,000? I think that's a very competitive offer and would allow us to close this out today.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close! I understand you're eager to close this deal, and I am too.  How about we meet at $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,7,
