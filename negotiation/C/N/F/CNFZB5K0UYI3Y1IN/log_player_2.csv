"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go directly to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to try to get a price well below my $100 maximum. It's possible Alice will be willing to go significantly lower than her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $125. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $125 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to my $100 limit, but I still want to see if Alice will come down further. There's no harm in trying to get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, Bob. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $110.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $100."
