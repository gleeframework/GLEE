"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire something valuable at a fair price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exaggerating the product's worth to you. While she's offering a discount, it's likely she's willing to go lower. By rejecting her offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower the price further to secure the sale. 
* **Get a better deal:** Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $10,000. 

It's worth seeing if you can get a better price before resorting to your backup option."
