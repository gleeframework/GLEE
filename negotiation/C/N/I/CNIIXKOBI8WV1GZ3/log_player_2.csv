Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. He's highlighting the shared value of the product to justify his offer. This approach sets a strong negotiating position and leaves room for compromise in the following rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more savings. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating flexibility by adjusting his counteroffer. This offer is closer to Alice's latest proposal, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than John's. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save even more, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price, and with only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk of running out of time. It's better to accept this offer than risk having to buy from John at a higher price or continue negotiating and potentially reaching an impasse. Bob can still save a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
