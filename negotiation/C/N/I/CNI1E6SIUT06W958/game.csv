"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $90, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a deal for $98. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
