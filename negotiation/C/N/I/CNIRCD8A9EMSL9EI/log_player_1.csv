"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but still below Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I want to start the conversation in a positive and friendly way to build rapport. 
* **Highlight value:**  I mention that it's a ""great product"" to subtly remind Bob of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $100?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see how determined Bob is to buy the product.

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and enthusiastic approach to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think $105 is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 away from my desired profit margin.  
* **Risk of losing deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with the less desirable option of selling to John for $80.
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a deal.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
