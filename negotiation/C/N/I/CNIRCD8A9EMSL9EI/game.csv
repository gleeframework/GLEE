"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $100?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think $105 is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
