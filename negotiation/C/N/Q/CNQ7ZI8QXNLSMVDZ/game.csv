"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000. This is my absolute maximum, as I'm very close to my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,500, which is $11,250. This is my final counteroffer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
