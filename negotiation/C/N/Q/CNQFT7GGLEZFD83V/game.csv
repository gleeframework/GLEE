"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value is more than worth the price. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000, which still gives you a great deal.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway. While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
