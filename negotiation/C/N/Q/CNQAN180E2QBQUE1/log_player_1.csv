Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,650,000. This product truly is valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is valuable, but I still think $1,650,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,580,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation and Bob is unlikely to go much higher. $1,580,000 is a substantial profit above my minimum, so it's the most logical decision at this point."
