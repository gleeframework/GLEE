You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating further to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down to his maximum budget of $800,000. This initial counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It is worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap between his offer and Alice's. This counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise, showing willingness to move closer to Alice's position but still staying within a reasonable range."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing.  At this point, buying from John for $800,000 guarantees a deal within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation."
