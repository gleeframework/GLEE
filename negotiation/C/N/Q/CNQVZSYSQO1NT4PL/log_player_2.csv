"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get the product for less. It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since Bob has a clear alternative (buying from John) and Alice has a higher value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering my alternative options.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is coming down in price, it's still higher than Bob's alternative option of buying from John. Bob should continue to try and negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,350,000 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $1,300,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is closer to his desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's only $25,000 higher than his alternative from John, and he has a few more rounds to potentially lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to meeting your price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to an agreement, but $1,275,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would be a fair price considering the product's value and my need to reach a deal quickly. If we can agree on this, we can finalize the transaction.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although Alice is getting closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate further.  He should aim for a price closer to his alternative offer from John. It's worth trying to get the price even lower since he has a few rounds left."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,285,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1285000}
