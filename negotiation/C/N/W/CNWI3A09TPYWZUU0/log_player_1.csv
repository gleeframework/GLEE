I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point that shows I'm open to a deal, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my last offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm confident John will buy the product at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
