"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $10000 would be a more reasonable price for me to pay. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
