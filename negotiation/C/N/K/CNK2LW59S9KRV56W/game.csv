"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you agree.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! However, I was thinking that $10,000 is still a bit low considering the value I'm bringing to the table. I can do $10,500, and that's my final offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
