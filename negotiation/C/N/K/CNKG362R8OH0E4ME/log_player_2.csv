This product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. This is not a good deal for Bob. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is still better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate further.  He can potentially get the price lower than $13,000."
