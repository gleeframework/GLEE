"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a great product at a good price, and I still make a good profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and proceed to negotiate with John, aiming for the $1,200,000 price he's willing to sell at."
