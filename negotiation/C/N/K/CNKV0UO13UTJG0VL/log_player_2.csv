Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $11,200, which is just $100 more than your last offer. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you the product for $11,100, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's offer is still higher than his budget, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price that meets his goal.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
