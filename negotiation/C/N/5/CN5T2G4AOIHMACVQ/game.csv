"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $990,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
