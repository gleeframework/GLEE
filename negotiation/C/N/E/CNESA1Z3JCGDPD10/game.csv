"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $800000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $750000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $650000. Can you meet me at that price?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $650000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
