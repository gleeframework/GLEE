"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) that is well above Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired minimum.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message brief and polite, emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to make it more appealing to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John in mind, which gives me a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. How about we set the product price at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal. 
* **Strategy:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter with a price between $950,000 and my minimum of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired minimum while still being competitive and keeping the potential deal with John in mind."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my appreciation for Bob's offer while still highlighting the need for a higher price.  I'm using the term ""fair compromise"" to frame my offer in a positive light.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price in the middle ground, I'm hoping to demonstrate flexibility and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement. This move also keeps the negotiation progressing towards my desired minimum while still being responsive to Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price. However, I still feel that $1,025,000 is quite high. Considering the market conditions and similar products available, I would like to propose a price of $975,000. This offers a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired minimum, it's still below what I need. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for that amount.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer. I'll emphasize the value of my product and the fairness of my proposed price to try and sway Bob towards a deal closer to my desired minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market, but my product offers unique features that justify a higher price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $990,000.  This price reflects the value I'm offering and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's only slightly higher than Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying closer to my desired minimum.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the unique value of my product and framing the proposed price as a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" This encourages Bob to see the deal as a positive outcome for both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to push Bob towards a price closer to my minimum while still showing flexibility and encouraging him to see the value in my product. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning closing the deal and moving forward, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide if I should continue negotiating or accept John's offer. I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and aim to secure a price as close to my desired minimum as possible."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a middle ground.  While $980,000 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $995,000.  This price reflects the value we've both agreed on while still allowing us to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value we've both agreed on and using the ""meet in the middle"" approach to make my offer seem more appealing. I'm also creating a sense of urgency by mentioning the limited time we have to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds remaining, I'm trying to close the gap between our offers as quickly as possible. By offering a price in the middle, I hope to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and believe we can still achieve a satisfactory outcome for both parties. How about we set the product price at $985,000? This proposal respects the value of your product while staying within my budget constraints.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Decision:** I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, meaning only two rounds remain. 
* **Price gap:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, the gap is still significant.
* **John's offer:** John is willing to pay my desired minimum, which is a much better outcome for me. 

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I can guarantee myself a price that meets my minimum requirement. Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a better result and risks losing the deal altogether.  I've already made a significant effort to negotiate with Bob, but time constraints and John's offer make selling to John the most favorable option."
