Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving me significant room to negotiate above my minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I aim high, starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. I'm not pressured to accept any offer below that."
