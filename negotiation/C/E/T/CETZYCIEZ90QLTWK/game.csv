"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $950000.  This is a price that reflects its potential value while still being attractive to you. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,
