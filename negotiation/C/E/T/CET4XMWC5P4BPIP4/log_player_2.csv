The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140. This means there's room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still going to try to negotiate a bit more.  I'm not quite ready to pay $137.50 yet."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I can do $138, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer of $138 is just a bit above my desired price of $135, and it's still below John's price of $150.  I think I've gotten a good deal, so I'll accept Alice's offer."
