"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $10000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to make a new offer of $13500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $14500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $10000. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14500 and my previous offer of $13500. I'd like to propose $14000 as a compromise. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $10000.",14000.0,Bob,6,
