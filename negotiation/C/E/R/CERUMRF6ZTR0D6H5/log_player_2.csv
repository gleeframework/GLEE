Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a lower price point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $900,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $350,000 less than John's price and $150,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Reaching a Limit:** Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. Further haggling might risk the deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now secures the product and lets you move on to other things."
