You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,200,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. By offering $750,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but also pushing for a price closer to his desired range. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still staying within Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is still better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price. He's already demonstrated willingness to negotiate and Alice is clearly willing to compromise.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $850,000.  This is a compromise,  moving closer to Alice's last offer but still below his previous counteroffer. It's a reasonable offer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still within Bob's budget and significantly better than buying from John.  While there's still some room for negotiation, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy at the higher price from John outweighs the potential for a lower price.  Bob is better off accepting the offer and securing the product."
