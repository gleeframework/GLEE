"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?  I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  Could you meet me at $16,000? This would allow me to make this deal work.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is important to you, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
