"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for something like this. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $60 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a great product and I'm sure you'll be happy with it at this price. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair price and I'm ready to buy if you're agreeable.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $85? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think!",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, I appreciate that.  I can go up to $78, but that's really the absolute limit for me.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your limits, but $78 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",82.0,Alice,7,
