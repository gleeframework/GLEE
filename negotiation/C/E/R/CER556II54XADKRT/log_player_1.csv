Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that the offer is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer to ensure Alice doesn't lose profit if Bob rejects."
