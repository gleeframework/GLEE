"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $600,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and demonstrates my serious intent to negotiate. It's likely Alice will reject this counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to make a more moderate counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite a bit higher than my counteroffer of $600,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially since Alice rejected my counteroffer. I will try to reach a more favorable price by making another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, so I'm meeting her halfway with a price of $700,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a good price. It's likely she'll accept this offer, but if not, I'm willing to go slightly higher in the next round if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $25,000 away from my last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting her offer at $775,000 saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's within my budget."
