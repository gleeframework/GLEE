"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for less than $120. Alice's initial offer of $180 is way too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer at $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and Alice will likely counter back with a higher price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still $40 more than his maximum budget. It's better to reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He raises his offer slightly from $100 to $110. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but still expects a lower price. The counteroffer should encourage further negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. While it's getting closer, he's not willing to pay that much yet.  He'll continue to negotiate to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he's still trying to get a better deal.  He increases his offer to $115, showing Alice he's serious about buying, but still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer is a good compromise and might be enough to convince Alice to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. He's already had several rounds of negotiation and is nearing the end of his rounds. There's a risk Alice might keep lowering the price only a little bit, making it a long and ultimately unsuccessful negotiation.

It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John. He'll get the product at his desired price, saving himself further negotiation and potential frustration."
