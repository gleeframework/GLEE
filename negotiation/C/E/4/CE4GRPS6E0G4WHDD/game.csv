"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go down to $125.  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $120.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
