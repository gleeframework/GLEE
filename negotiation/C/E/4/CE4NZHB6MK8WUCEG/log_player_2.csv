"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1000000. It's a truly unique asset with incredible potential. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to discussion. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's wise to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire [Product Name].  However, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lower counteroffer:** Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Bob's seriousness in acquiring the product.
* **Reasoning:**  Bob provides a reason for the lower price (""outside my budget"") and suggests a fair and reasonable alternative.
* **Open to discussion:** Bob keeps the door open for further negotiation by asking for Alice's thoughts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. However, it is getting closer to his target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While I acknowledge the product's value, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but respectful:** Bob reiterates his budget limitations but remains respectful of Alice's position.
* **Maximum offer:** Bob clearly states this is his absolute maximum, making it clear there's no room for further reductions on his end.
* **Emphasis on value:** Bob mentions the product's true worth, subtly reminding Alice that his offer is fair.
* **Closing the deal:** Bob expresses his desire to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency."
