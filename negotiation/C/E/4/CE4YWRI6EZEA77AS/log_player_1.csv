"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that's still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects, but also demonstrates my desire for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to hold out for a bit more. I believe I can get a higher price with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly, but still staying below Bob's perceived value. I want to show him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give away the product for too little."
