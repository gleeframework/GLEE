"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's a bit closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating with Bob or sell to John.  I'll try to get a higher offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'm hoping to get a higher offer from Bob in the next round. If he doesn't increase his offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob. He's not budging much, and I'm running out of time.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
