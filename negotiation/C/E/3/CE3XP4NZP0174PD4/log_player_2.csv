Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $120. This price reflects the excellent value it offers compared to its actual worth of $150, making it a fantastic deal for you. I trust you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, $120 is still significantly more than your $80 limit and the guaranteed $80 price from John. You can save the most money by going with John."
