"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to a reasonable value for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm working with a tight budget. Could we possibly agree on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too far below my minimum price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $9,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $8,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500, but that's my final offer.  This price allows you to get a great deal, and it's also closer to what I believe the product is worth.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,7,
