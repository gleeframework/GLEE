Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to a reasonable value for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too far below my minimum price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $9,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $8,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500, but that's my final offer.  This price allows you to get a great deal, and it's also closer to what I believe the product is worth.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $500."
