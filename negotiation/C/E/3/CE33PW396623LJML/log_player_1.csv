"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $10,000, I establish a high anchor point. This makes it more likely Bob will see $10,000 as a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
* **Positive and confident:** The message is optimistic and emphasizes the product's value. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $10,000 is still significantly above my minimum of $8,000, allowing room for concessions if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I haven't exhausted all options yet. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate for a quick sale. This gives me leverage for future rounds. 
* **Maintaining value:**  Accepting Bob's offer immediately would mean I'm not maximizing the potential value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to the value I see in the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $10,000 offer. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $9,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This approach is fair and reasonable. 
* **Maintaining value:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so it's a good deal for me, while leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive tone to emphasize that we're both trying to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining value:** While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can achieve a better price with further negotiation.
* **Leveraging remaining rounds:**  I still have 6 rounds left. Rejecting this offer shows that I'm not desperate and willing to push for a better price.
* **John's offer:** John's offer of $8,000 is still a safe option if negotiations with Bob fail completely. 

**Next steps:** I'll counter with a price closer to $8,000 to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:** $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I reiterate the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Building urgency (subtle):**  I mention ""getting us closer to a deal"" to subtly imply that time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short of my budget, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're now at round 6 out of 10.  There's significant risk that the negotiations with Bob will continue to stall, wasting valuable time.
* **Potential for further reductions:** Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum of $8,000.  There's a good chance he'll continue to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John's offer of $8,000 is secure and guarantees a profit.  There's no point in risking further losses with Bob. 

While I would prefer to earn more, selling to John at this point minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower sale price or no sale at all."
