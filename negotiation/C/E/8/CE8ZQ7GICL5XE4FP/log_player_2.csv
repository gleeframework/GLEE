"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting the offer:** This would cost you $950,000.
* **Buying from John:** This would cost you $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting the offer:** This allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. There's room for negotiation as you value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice's minimum is $800,000.  

By rejecting, you're keeping your options open and attempting to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:**  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than her minimum value. This shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still space for Alice to come up slightly, and for you to potentially go up a bit if necessary.
* **Alternative:** You still have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting the offer:** This would cost you $1,000,000.
* **Buying from John:** This would cost you $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting the offer:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth another counteroffer to try and close the gap further.

By rejecting, you're continuing to try and minimize your costs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway.  You've increased your offer by $50,000 from the previous round, demonstrating you're serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This price is still lower than Alice's offer, but it's closer to her potential acceptable range.
* **Alternative:** You still have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, but this counteroffer aims to get a better deal before resorting to that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,050,000 is getting too close to your maximum price of $1,200,000.
* **Counteroffer:** Another counteroffer might work, but there's a risk Alice might reject it again, and you'd have to go even higher.
* **John's offer:**  You can get the product from John for a fixed price of $1,200,000, which is guaranteed.

It's now more beneficial to take the certain deal with John and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  While it's not the best possible price, it's still within your budget and eliminates the risk of a longer negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
