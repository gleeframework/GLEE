Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to me is quite high, and $1,500,000 falls short of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,550,000?"",

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could continue negotiating, Bob's offer is now getting close to the halfway point between our initial ask and his initial offer.  It's a strong price, especially considering we're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. It's better to take a very good offer now than risk Bob walking away and getting a lower price from John."
