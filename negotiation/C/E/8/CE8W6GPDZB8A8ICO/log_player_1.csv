""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,150,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed purchase price ($1,200,000) maximizes the chance of a sale while exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,150,000  leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit for Alice even if Bob manages to haggle the price down slightly.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides Alice with a strong fallback option. This allows her to confidently negotiate from a position of strength."
