"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment and the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1,250,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
