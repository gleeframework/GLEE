"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely do better. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to my target price of $800,000, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, given the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save some more, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is tempting, I'm still determined to see if I can push for a lower price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to buy from John at a much higher price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is closer to where I want to be, but let's try $860,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to come away feeling like we got a good deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I'm still not comfortable going below $880,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $860,000, so I'll offer it to you for $872,500. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $872,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $872,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $872,500 is getting close to my target price. It's likely she won't go any lower, and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
