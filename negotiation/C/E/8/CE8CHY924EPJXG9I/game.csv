"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, given the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to save some more, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is closer to where I want to be, but let's try $860,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to come away feeling like we got a good deal.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I'm still not comfortable going below $880,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $860,000, so I'll offer it to you for $872,500. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",872500.0,Alice,7,
