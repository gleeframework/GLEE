Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* This strategy aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
    *  Potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
    *  Avoid immediate rejection and keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I want to get for the product. I'm confident in the product's value and want to try to negotiate further with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000** is a compromise. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. It signals a willingness to negotiate but also shows that I'm not willing to give away the product for much less than its value.
* The message is direct and clear, stating that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* The goal is to:
    * Secure a price closer to my desired value.
    *  Push Bob towards accepting the offer.
    *  Avoid endless rounds of counteroffers that could lead to a stalemate."
