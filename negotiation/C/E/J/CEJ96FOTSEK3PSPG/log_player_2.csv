"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for $16,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $16,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $13,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. What do you think?

While $14,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. It's worth continuing negotiations with Alice, potentially meeting her halfway at $13,750, to see if she'll budge further."

Alice's offer:

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's more efficient and cost-effective to buy the product from John, as that price is within his budget and will save him money."
