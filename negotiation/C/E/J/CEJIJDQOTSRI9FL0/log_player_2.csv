"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is above that.  It's better to reject the offer and see if a lower price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what he's willing to pay. This will likely spark further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price. While it's closer to his limit, Bob still wants to try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly, showing some flexibility while still trying to stay below his $100 limit. This counteroffer might be more appealing to Alice than the previous one, potentially leading to a deal closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, he's still hoping to secure a better deal. There's only a $5 difference between the current offer and what Bob would pay from John.  Bob wants to see if he can get Alice down to $100 or very close to it before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. He believes this is a fair price and that Alice might be willing to accept it, considering she's already lowered her offer significantly.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can easily switch to John and get the product for the same price."
