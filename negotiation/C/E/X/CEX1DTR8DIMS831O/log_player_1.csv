Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}

Round 4
