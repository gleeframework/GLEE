(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget and closer to Alice's value. A $9,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial $11,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. This initial counteroffer is a strong starting point for finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial $11,000, Bob can still do better.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, but the goal is to save as much as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer to find a middle ground. $9,500 is a compromise between his previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal."
