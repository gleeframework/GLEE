Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $9,000. This is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a higher price than John's $8,000 offer, but I want to leave room for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $9,000 offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and allow us to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price John is willing to pay.  It's time to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation."
