"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $9,000, it's not a good deal. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $7,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial price of $9,000, but still leaves room for her to make a profit, considering the product is worth $8,000 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still higher than what the product is worth to me ($8,000). I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. This is also the price John is selling the product for, so it's a fair offer for both of us. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John."
