# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be of great value to your business. My initial price is $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's discuss further!

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.

```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has only 3 rounds left.

It's likely that further negotiation won't get a much lower price, so accepting is the best option at this point."
