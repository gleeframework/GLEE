"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $105. How about we try $98? I'm willing to pay that much for the product.,98.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $98.  Would you consider $102? That's my final offer.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $102 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can you consider that?,95.0,Bob,6,
