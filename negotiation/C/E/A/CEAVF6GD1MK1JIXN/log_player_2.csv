# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I think this is a great chance for you to get an amazing deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
