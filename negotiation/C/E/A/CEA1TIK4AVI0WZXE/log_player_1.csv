Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $149 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially increasing your profit slightly.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out."
