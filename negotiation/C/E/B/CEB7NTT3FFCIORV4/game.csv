"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I think this product is great, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $130? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $145. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",145.0,Alice,5,
