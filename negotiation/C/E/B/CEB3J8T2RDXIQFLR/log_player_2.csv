"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down in price but it's still too high. We're moving in the right direction though, so continuing negotiations is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $950,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and reflects my serious interest in the product."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I've given this offer serious consideration, and to be completely transparent,  $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  I believe this is more than fair given the product's value and potential.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has revealed that $1,200,000 is the lowest she'll go. This is above your maximum budget, and while you could try negotiating further, there's no guarantee of success.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
