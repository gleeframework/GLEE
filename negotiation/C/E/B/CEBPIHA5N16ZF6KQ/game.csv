"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $750,000? I'm confident this product would be a great asset to my business, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price lower, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",800000.0,Alice,5,
