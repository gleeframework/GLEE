"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,250,000 is significantly closer to your maximum budget than to Alice's minimum desired price. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have time:**  It's only round 1. You have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you have a backup option with John gives you more negotiating power. 

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer Alice with a lower price. Aim for a price that is closer to Alice's minimum but still within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  It shows that you are serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  This offer allows for some room to bargain if Alice counters. You can then potentially meet in the middle.
* **Keeps John's offer in mind:**  You are still well within your budget, giving you the freedom to walk away if Alice becomes unreasonable. 

**Next Steps:**  Wait for Alice's response to your counteroffer.  Be prepared to counter again if she rejects your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While closer to your desired price, $1,375,000 is still a significant chunk of your budget, and you've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate lower.
* **More room to negotiate:** You've only had three rounds, and there's still potential to get a better price. Alice is demonstrating a willingness to come down, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitful.
* **John's offer remains a safe fallback:** Having John's offer as a backup allows you to be more aggressive in your negotiations.

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer Alice with a price lower than $1,375,000 but higher than your previous offer of $1,050,000. Aim for a price that is closer to your desired outcome but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,050,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,375,000). 
* **Signal of good faith:** This shows Alice you are serious about making a deal and are willing to compromise. 
* **Still within your budget:** $1,150,000 is still well within your maximum budget of $1,500,000, leaving some wiggle room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** Wait to see if Alice accepts your counteroffer. If she rejects, you'll need to analyze her counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving further away:**  Instead of getting closer to your desired price, Alice's offer increased from the previous round. This suggests she might be becoming less flexible. 
* **You're not getting a good deal:**  $1,425,000 is closer to your maximum budget than to Alice's minimum desired price. You're not getting a significant discount.
* **Still time to negotiate:** You have five rounds left. While Alice is showing signs of being stubborn, there's still time to try and get a better deal.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  This is important because you need to be prepared to walk away if the negotiations become unproductive.

**Next Steps:**  You need to be more assertive in your counteroffer. Since Alice seems resistant to lower prices, you need to push back harder."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's last offer, demonstrating your resolve to get a good price.
* **Playing the Time Card:**  With only 4 rounds left, Alice might be more likely to accept a lower offer to avoid risking a deal falling through.
* **A Clear Signal:**  This counteroffer shows Alice that you're willing to walk away if she's not willing to be flexible.

**Next Steps:**  Wait to see if Alice accepts.  If she rejects, you'll need to decide if you're willing to counter again or if you'll take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:**  She's actually increasing her asking price again, indicating she's not serious about making a deal at a reasonable price.
* **Limited rounds left:**  You only have three rounds left, so time is running out. While this is worrisome, it also gives you leverage to push harder for a better price.
* **John's offer is still your fallback:** This is crucial, as it gives you the confidence to walk away if the negotiations continue to be unproductive.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer again, but you need to be more aggressive.  Consider a counteroffer that's even lower than your previous one to signal your frustration with Alice's unwillingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,075,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is a very low counteroffer, almost at Alice's minimum price. It's a risky move, but it signals that you're nearing the end of your patience and that you might walk away.
* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, this is your last chance to push for a lower price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net:**  You can walk away from the deal if Alice refuses to budge.

**Next Steps:**  Wait for Alice's response. If she rejects, you'll likely have to accept John's offer, or else risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unreasonable:**  Alice is continuing to increase her offer, demonstrating she's not interested in a fair negotiation.  You've made substantial concessions and she's not reciprocating.
* **Time is running out:**  This is the final round. If you reject this offer, you risk losing the deal and being left with nothing.
* **John's offer is a reasonable alternative:** While not ideal, buying from John guarantees you the product within your budget.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut your losses. Alice is clearly not willing to compromise, and you don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely. Buying from John is the most practical decision."
