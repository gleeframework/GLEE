Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while still ensuring the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you a higher profit than John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and frame it positively.

By aiming high but leaving room for negotiation, this strategy maximizes the potential profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
