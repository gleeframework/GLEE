Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price but still leaves room for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
``` 

I'm offering $13,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to $13,750, it's not worth risking further negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with John's offer of $12,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
