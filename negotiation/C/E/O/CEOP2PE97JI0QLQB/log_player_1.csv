{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so $14,000 gives him room to negotiate but still allows you to potentially make a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** You value the product at $15,000, so you're leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring you won't lose money. 
* **It's a friendly and encouraging message:** This helps keep the negotiation positive and increases the chances of Bob accepting your offer. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response, and you have the option to go with John's offer of $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer to him. It is too low of a price to accept.  I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}
