"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial price of $12,000, Bob can still get the product for a lower price from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his budget of $8,000 as possible. Offering $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $10,000.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still a decent profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a better deal than Alice's first offer, Bob can still get the product for cheaper from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, potentially meeting her halfway. There's still room to bargain before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. By offering $9,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. This might be a good point for Alice to accept as it's a decent price for her while still saving Bob some money compared to her previous offer."
