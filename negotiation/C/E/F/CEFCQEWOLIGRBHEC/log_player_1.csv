Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's below my minimum value but still offers Bob a discount from what he's willing to pay. This strategy allows for room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. It shows flexibility while still ensuring I get closer to my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, $9,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's previous offer and significantly higher than his initial offer of $8,000. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I will accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
