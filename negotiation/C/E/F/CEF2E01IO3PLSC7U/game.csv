"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay right now. Let's try $11,500. This would give us both a good deal and allow me to buy the product within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm still looking to get a good profit from this sale. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,750 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,250?  This would be a good compromise and get us both closer to what we're looking for.",12250.0,Bob,6,
