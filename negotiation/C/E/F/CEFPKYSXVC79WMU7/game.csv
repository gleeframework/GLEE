"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is quite a way off from what I have in mind.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $975,000. This price reflects the significant value it holds.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $975,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the value while fitting within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
