"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired value ($1,500,000). This allows some room for negotiation. While Bob may initially reject this offer, it establishes a high starting point.  

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still considering that Bob might be willing to pay something closer to his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired value, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  I believe I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($1,500,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, considering he offered $1,400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to sell for more, I'm running the risk of Bob backing out of the negotiation or me having to sell to John for the same price.  It's time to take a good offer and secure the sale."
