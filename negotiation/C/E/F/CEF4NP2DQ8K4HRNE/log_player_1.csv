Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. My asking price is $11,500, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice a chance to still get a price significantly higher than $8,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to go below that price.

**Why this is better than offering a price closer to $8,000:**

* Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if the product solves a significant need. 
* Offering a very low price initially might make Bob suspicious of the product's quality or value."
