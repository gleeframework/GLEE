"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is well above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice and see if I can get a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I still have more rounds left before I need to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit, and $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet at $15,000? I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget, and we're running out of rounds.  It's becoming clear that Alice isn't going to budge much further.  I've got a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000, so it's time to take it. I'm going to choose option (3) and buy the product from John."
