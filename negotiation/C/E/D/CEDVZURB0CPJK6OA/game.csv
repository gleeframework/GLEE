"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit, and $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet at $15,000? I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to cover my costs.",15000.0,Alice,5,
