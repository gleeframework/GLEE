"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know is worth at least $1000000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's very fair, considering its value.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $1,000,000. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
