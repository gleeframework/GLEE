Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your $15,000 goal.
* **Appeal to Value:** By mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, potentially making him more inclined to accept.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal without risking losing the sale to John."
