Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $800,000.  What do you think?

You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's doing so in relatively small increments.  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, and his offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.  It's unlikely Bob will meet or exceed John's offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer ensures the highest possible profit."
