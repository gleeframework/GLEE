"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Bob and Alice, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $1,150,000, Bob is saving $50,000 compared to buying from John.  It's likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is now a factor. Accepting the offer secures a lower price and guarantees the acquisition."
