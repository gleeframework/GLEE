"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation range.  I'm aiming for a good profit, but also want to ensure the deal doesn't fall apart too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I need to be mindful of time, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially when John offers $15,000. I will counter Bob's offer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. I'm aiming for a price that is fair to both of us and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to John's offer of $15,000 and is above my minimum of $15,000. While I would prefer more, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids any further back-and-forth."
