Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer, as I already have other interested parties."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I believe the product is valuable, $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob meeting me at $1,200,000 is a fair deal. It's important to recognize when to accept a strong offer, even if it's not the absolute maximum. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
