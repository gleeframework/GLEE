Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
