"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you presenting this product to me. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $9500? ",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for your product, and I respect that. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're open to this.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not sure I can go as low as $10500. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a price that I think reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to consider other options if you're willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
