Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to your business. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position.  This allows for a bolder opening offer. 
* **Respectful and Professional Tone:** The message aims to establish a positive and collaborative tone."
