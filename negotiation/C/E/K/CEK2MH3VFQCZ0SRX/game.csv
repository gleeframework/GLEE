"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I'm looking to get out of this sale, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
