Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value to him, hoping to motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
