"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to establish a strong initial position and gauge Bob's level of interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,700,000. This is still a significant amount higher than Bob's offer, but it shows willingness to negotiate.  It's a step closer to my ideal price, but it's still  within a range where a deal might be possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not ready to sell at such a loss. I will reject his offer and try to secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is still well above Bob's offer, but shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe we can still reach a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this offer. If he rejects it, I'm ready to sell to John for the same price."
