"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not comfortable meeting you at $10000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is a significant concession, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $12500. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, Alice. I really like the product, but I've already found a better deal with John for $12000. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $11500. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider buying from you. Otherwise, I'll be going with John.",11500.0,Bob,6,
