"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your initial asking price and my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit short on my desired profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,100. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,5,
