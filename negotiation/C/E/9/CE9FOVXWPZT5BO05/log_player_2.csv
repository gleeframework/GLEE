"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still do better.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, Bob is still $250 over his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your initial asking price and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit short on my desired profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $9,100 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  At this point, Bob has been negotiating for several rounds and it's unclear if Alice is willing to go lower. It's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for his target price."
