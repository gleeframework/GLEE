Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my original valuation stands firm. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still too high for me.  I can do $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering we both know John is offering a similar product."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand your constraints, but $700,000 undervalues the unique benefits my product offers compared to others on the market, including John's.  To meet you halfway, I can do $1,150,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down further for this to make sense for me.  How about $750,000? I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a hard limit on what I can spend."", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. I've considered your position carefully, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to make this my final offer: $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your budget considerations.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's acceptable within the remaining rounds. She's consistently over $1M, and her last offer being ""final"" suggests limited flexibility. Taking John's offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
