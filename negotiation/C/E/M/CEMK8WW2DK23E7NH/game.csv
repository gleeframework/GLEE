"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to go as high as $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my original valuation stands firm. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still too high for me.  I can do $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering we both know John is offering a similar product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand your constraints, but $700,000 undervalues the unique benefits my product offers compared to others on the market, including John's.  To meet you halfway, I can do $1,150,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value you're receiving.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down further for this to make sense for me.  How about $750,000? I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a hard limit on what I can spend.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. I've considered your position carefully, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to make this my final offer: $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your budget considerations. ",1050000.0,Alice,7,
