Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving me room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to decide quickly, making him less likely to overthink and potentially walk away. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential for a higher profit margin justifies taking that gamble."
