Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but still lower than my ideal price.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my desired $1,800,000."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement closer to my initial asking price."
