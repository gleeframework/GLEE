"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a ways off from what I'm hoping to get for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $15,000 is still a little out of my price range. How about we split the difference at $12,500? It's a fair compromise and closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,500 is still a significant discount from what I'm willing to accept.  How about we settle at $14,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I still believe I can get a better deal.  $14,000 is still a significant amount above my ideal price.  I'll continue negotiating in the hopes of getting closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  $14,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  It's a fair price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're really pushing me on this!  I said $14,000 was my final offer, and I meant it.  However, I'm willing to throw in [mention a small but tangible bonus related to the product, like a service or accessory] if we can close the deal at that price.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is throwing in a bonus, $14,000 is still higher than my budget and I've already made multiple counteroffers. It's likely further negotiation will be difficult.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product for a lower price, so I will go with that option."
