Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is quite low.  While it's tempting to accept John's offer, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a ways off from what I'm hoping to get for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $15,000 is still a little out of my price range. How about we split the difference at $12,500? It's a fair compromise and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,500 is still a significant discount from what I'm willing to accept.  How about we settle at $14,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  $14,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  It's a fair price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one. Bob's offer is getting closer to acceptable, but I've laid out my ""final offer"". I need to decide if I'm willing to risk losing the deal to try and get a bit more.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're really pushing me on this!  I said $14,000 was my final offer, and I meant it.  However, I'm willing to throw in [mention a small but tangible bonus related to the product, like a service or accessory] if we can close the deal at that price.
