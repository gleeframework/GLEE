Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Alice's Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. Offering the product at $1,400,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Incentivizes Bob:** The price is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it a tempting offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **High Anchor:** By starting with a high price, even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is likely to get a price closer to her desired amount.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's a tough negotiator, he might try to lowball. Alice should be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that's acceptable to her, knowing she has John as a backup."
