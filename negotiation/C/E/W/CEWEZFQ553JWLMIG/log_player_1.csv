Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $160, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. This might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob only values the product at $80, there's a chance he might be willing to go a bit higher, especially if he really wants it.  

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80 for this product. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $80 is too low. I know I can get at least $120 from John. I need to negotiate upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $120? This product is really worth it."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Understanding:** I acknowledge Bob's budget while firmly stating that his offer is too low.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting $120, my minimum acceptable price,  presents it as a compromise while still ensuring I don't make a loss. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to reconsider his offer.

I'm aiming for a quick and clean negotiation that benefits both parties. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't budge."
