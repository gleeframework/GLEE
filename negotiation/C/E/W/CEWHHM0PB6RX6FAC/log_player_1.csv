"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This price is fair, considering your value for the product and my budget.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.
