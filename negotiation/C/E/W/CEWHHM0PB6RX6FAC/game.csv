"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the immense value and potential this product holds.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This price is fair, considering your value for the product and my budget.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
