,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
