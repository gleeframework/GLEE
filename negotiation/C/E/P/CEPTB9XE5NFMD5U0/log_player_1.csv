"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's ""potential"" and ""return on investment,"" I'm focusing on its value to Bob rather than just stating a high price arbitrarily.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also sets a high bar that Bob will need to work to bring down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His jump from $800,000 to $1,500,000 suggests he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum to aim for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with an offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of this product. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, my counter-offer is still substantially higher than both Bob's offer and my minimum price, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value and potential, subtly anchoring his perception above his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob has introduced a sense of urgency and finality with his ""final offer"" statement. While he might be bluffing, it's risky to assume he'll be willing to negotiate further. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away and accepting my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 

This is a good deal at this point in the negotiation."
