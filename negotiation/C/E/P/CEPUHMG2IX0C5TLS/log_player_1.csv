Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its potential value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This is to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Highlighting potential value:** I'm mentioning the product's ""potential value"" to subtly imply it could be worth even more to Bob than the price I'm asking. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build a rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider my offer. 

This is just the first step in the negotiation.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to take the $1,000,000, it would be a substantial loss for me. I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, hoping to get a better price or perhaps use this low offer to gauge his true interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand this product may have a different value to you, but I'm confident it's worth more than that.  To show my willingness to continue negotiating, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,750,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging his offer to show respect and keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlight the value difference:** I subtly reiterate the potential value difference between our perspectives, hoping to make him reconsider his low offer.
* **Compromise:**  I propose a counteroffer that is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" and a ""good value,"" making it sound more attractive to Bob. 

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a loss on this product.  

I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob if I continue to negotiate.  I'll send a counteroffer, hoping to close the gap further.  

If Bob doesn't budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John at $1,500,000, as that's the best alternative I have available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,500,000. This is a price that reflects its true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. It's my final offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I acknowledge his offer to show respect and keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Emphasize my minimum:** I reiterate that his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **""Meet you halfway"":** I frame my counteroffer as a compromise, suggesting that I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Final offer:**  I state clearly that this is my final offer.  This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Focus on fair value:** I emphasize the ""true value"" of the product and a ""fair profit"" for both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and might make him more likely to accept. 

This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob.  If he rejects my offer, I'll sell the product to John."
