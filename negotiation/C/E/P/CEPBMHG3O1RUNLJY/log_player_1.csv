Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit without jeopardizing the guaranteed amount significantly. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price close to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) might deter Bob.  A price of $1,450,000 gives the perception of a significant discount while leaving room for you to potentially negotiate slightly lower if needed.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision faster.

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible sale price from Bob while retaining the option of a guaranteed sale to John."
