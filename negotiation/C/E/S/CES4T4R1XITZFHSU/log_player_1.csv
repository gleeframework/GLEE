{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $120 is below what I need to sell for, I'm willing to go down to $140. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
 
I'm proposing a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows good faith and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. John is offering me my minimum, and I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and ending up with nothing. I'll go with the sure thing and sell to John."
