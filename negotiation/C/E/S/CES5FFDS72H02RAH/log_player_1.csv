"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""potential"" and ""value,"" I'm framing the product in a positive light, even at a high price.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I have John as a backup, securing a deal with Bob above my minimum is ideal. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Potentially secure a deal well above my minimum.
2. **Gather Information:** Understand Bob's willingness to pay and negotiation style.
3. **Maintain Control:**  Set a strong initial position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests he's attempting to anchor the negotiation very low. 

While I want to secure a deal, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, even if it means leveraging my option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a more balanced compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $350,000, which signals flexibility on my end. However, the new offer is still substantially higher than both Bob's initial offer and his perceived value. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value while positioning my offer as a ""fair compromise."" 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm avoiding getting too close to my minimum price too early.  This keeps the negotiation open but also signals that Bob needs to make a serious move if he wants to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value ($1,000,000) but is still considerably below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). His mention of a ""budget"" could be a genuine constraint or a negotiation tactic. 

I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm serious about my valuation and to encourage him to move closer to a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to secure a fair price, especially with John as my backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budget, and I'm genuinely trying to find a price that works for us both. Let's cut to the chase.  To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant investment on your part but reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm making it clear that this is my ""final offer"" to signal seriousness and encourage a decision from Bob.
* **Significant Concession, But Above Minimum:** I've dropped the price substantially to $1,600,000, which is still above my absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting that this is a significant investment for Bob, implying that it's justified by the value he'll receive. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, applying time pressure can push Bob towards a decision. 

This approach aims to either:

1. **Secure a Deal:** Encourage Bob to accept a price that's profitable for me.
2. **Force a Clear Response:**  Prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay so I can decide whether to continue negotiations or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to find some middle ground. Your final offer is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and there's a risk that Bob might not go much higher.
* **Solid Profit:** While I could push for more, accepting this offer secures a significant profit.

It's always tempting to hold out for the best possible deal. However, in a negotiation, it's crucial to recognize a strong offer when it's presented. Accepting now mitigates the risk of losing Bob altogether and ensures a successful outcome for me."
