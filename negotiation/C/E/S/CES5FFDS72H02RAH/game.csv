"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring to you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a more balanced compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget, and I'm genuinely trying to find a price that works for us both. Let's cut to the chase.  To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant investment on your part but reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find some middle ground. Your final offer is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
