"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your latest offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
