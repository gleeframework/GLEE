I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $9,500.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still closer to my desired price than Bob's."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $8,700 is only slightly lower than my desired price, and significantly higher than what John is offering. It's time to accept and secure the sale."
