Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, exceeding our own minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for potential negotiation (if Bob counter-offers) while staying above our guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" aims to make the offer more appealing."
