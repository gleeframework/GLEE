"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe the value you'll get from it makes this price very fair.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject the offer because the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $850,000, which is $50,000 more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
