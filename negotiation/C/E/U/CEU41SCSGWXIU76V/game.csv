"Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $11000. This would be a great deal for you and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
