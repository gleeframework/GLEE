Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($14,000) leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so you can afford to aim high with Bob."
