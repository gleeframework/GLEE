"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with an offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end and would allow us both to walk away with a profitable deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll counter with an offer of $887,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
