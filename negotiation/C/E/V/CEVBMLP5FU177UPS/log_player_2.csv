"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, and I can try to get a lower price. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is not a good option as it's higher than Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, it's  lower than I can accept. I could part with it for $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,200,000, which is still above my desired price but closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's a good deal for me compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John makes accepting her current offer the best choice."
