"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum but still considerably more than John's offer. I need to negotiate further.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, it's  lower than I can accept. I could part with it for $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
