"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, it's  lower than I can accept. I could part with it for $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
