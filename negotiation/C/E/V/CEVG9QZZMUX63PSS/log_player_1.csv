Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  I believe this product will bring you a lot of value and I want to find a price we both feel good about."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While $16,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, my final offer. I believe this is a very fair price considering the value it offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $13,500 is a solid profit over the minimum you're willing to accept ($12,000). 
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer in a predictable pattern. It's unlikely he'll drastically jump above this point.
* **Time:**  We're past the halfway point in negotiations. Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away or your next counteroffer being too low."
