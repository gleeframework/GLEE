Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $800,000, Bob represents a potential profit of $400,000. It makes sense to aim high initially.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential gain of $100,000, making it a very attractive proposition.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""one-time offer"" phrasing adds a layer of pressure and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects the offer, selling to John provides a reliable fallback option."
