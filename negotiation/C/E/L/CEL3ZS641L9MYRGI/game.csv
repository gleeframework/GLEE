"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's potential, that price point is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $900,000. This offer reflects the value it brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This offer represents a fair price while acknowledging the value of your product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $750,000 is getting closer. To be fair to both of us, I can come down slightly to $850,000. This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
