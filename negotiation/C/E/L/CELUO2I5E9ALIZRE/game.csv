"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher to cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I'm starting to think that I might need to consider buying from John if we can't meet in the middle. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
