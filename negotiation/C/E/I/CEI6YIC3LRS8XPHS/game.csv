"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in buying, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be realistic here, but $11000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $10000 as a final offer. This represents a genuine compromise on my part, and I truly hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10000 is a significant compromise for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $10000, which is $10500. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
