"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I value the product highly and am not desperate to sell.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 at any time, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not willing to settle for an unreasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering my price to $11,000, which is only $1,000 above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum value. However, I've already made several concessions and I'm not sure if he's willing to go higher.  Considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell the product to him for $10,000."
