Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to make even more profit from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $50,000 discount from his perceived value.
    * You make a $150,000 profit, which is more than selling it to John directly.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties adds a time constraint, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making it an attractive enough offer for him to accept."
