"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider  $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
