"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go that high. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for you to make a profit.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
