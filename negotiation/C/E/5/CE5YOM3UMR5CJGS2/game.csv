"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal happen. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's find a middle ground and get this done.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
