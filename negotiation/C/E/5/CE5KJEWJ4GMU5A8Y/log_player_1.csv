Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum price.  It allows for negotiation and potential for a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still above my minimum, but it's not ideal. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal without risking losing Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
