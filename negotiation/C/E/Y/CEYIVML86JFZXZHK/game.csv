"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. However, $900,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm confident this product will bring significant value to your business. How about we settle on $950,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. That's the highest I can go for now.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting close.  $925,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile, but I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Let's settle on $937,500.  I believe this price allows both of us to achieve a good outcome.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. I'm really hoping we can meet at this price.",920000.0,Bob,6,
