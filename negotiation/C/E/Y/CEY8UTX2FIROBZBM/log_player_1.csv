While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good business decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Stronger Offer:** Bob is clearly motivated and has increased his offer twice, indicating seriousness. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties involved in further negotiation. 

Accepting $875,000 provides a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a timely sale."
