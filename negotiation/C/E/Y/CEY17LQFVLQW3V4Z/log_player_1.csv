Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than his initial assessment, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear Bob isn't willing to budge much. He keeps offering the same $9,000.  Rather than continue a potentially drawn-out negotiation, I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John. It's the best option for maximizing my profit at this point."
