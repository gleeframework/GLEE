"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Reasoning:

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and is moving closer to my desired price point. While I could potentially squeeze a bit more, accepting $8,750 guarantees a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations.
