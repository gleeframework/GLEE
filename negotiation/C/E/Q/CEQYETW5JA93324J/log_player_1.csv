Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to let you have it for $135. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you believe the product is worth at least $120, you're anchoring Bob's perception of its value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $15 above your minimum, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still netting you a profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
