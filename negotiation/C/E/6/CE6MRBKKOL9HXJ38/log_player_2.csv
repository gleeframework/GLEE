Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the best price I can do, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, her price of $8,500 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. It's unlikely Alice will come down further, especially since she stated this is the ""best price"" she can do.  You maximize your savings by going with John's offer."
