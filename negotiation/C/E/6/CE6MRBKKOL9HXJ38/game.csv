"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I agree it's a good product, $9,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the best price I can do, considering the product's worth to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
