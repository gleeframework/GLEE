,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. Would you consider $9,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal without needing to go through more rounds.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $9,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit below my expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal without further delays.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, which is closer to your offer and still within my budget.  This would allow us to close the deal without needing to go through more rounds. What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,8,
