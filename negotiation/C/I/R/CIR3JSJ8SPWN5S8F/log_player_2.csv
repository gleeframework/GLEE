"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and counter with a much lower price to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering!  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, would you consider $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $12,000 is still above your ideal price and your backup offer from John. You should counter offer to keep negotiating towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice you are willing to negotiate but are also sticking to a price point closer to your goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is barely budging on price, and you're getting close to your limit. It's time to signal you're serious about your price range and willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $13,500 is pushing my budget. I can do $9,500, but that's really my limit.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

This counter-offer is crucial. It:
* Shows you're willing to slightly increase your offer
* Sets a firm limit, emphasizing it's your final offer
* Introduces the possibility of you walking away, giving Alice a reason to compromise"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the midpoint of our last two offers. Would you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice has met your price!  There's no need to negotiate further, as this matches what you're willing to pay and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
