Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It also highlights the value for Bob, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, it's still below my desired minimum of $8,000. I will try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit to $10,500. That's a fair offer considering the market and my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for more, Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum threshold of $8,000 and a reasonable compromise.  It's also likely that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or a stalemate, risking the sale to John. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
