"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to settle immediately. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $8500? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my target price. With only 6 rounds left, it's a good time to accept this offer.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with a lower offer from Bob, or even having to settle with John at $8,000, is too high at this point."
