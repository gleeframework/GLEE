"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving me a good margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'm confident in the product's value, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm offering $14,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a higher price than his offer. It's also closer to my initial asking price of $15,000, which could encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $14,200. This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my initial asking price of $15,000 to make it worthwhile. I'm confident that I can still get a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
