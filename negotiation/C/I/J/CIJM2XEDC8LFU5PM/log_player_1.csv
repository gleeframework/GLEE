Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit, and this price is well above your $1,000,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer while still leaving you with a good profit.

This strategy sets you up for a successful negotiation while also ensuring you have a backup buyer (John) if things don't work out with Bob."
