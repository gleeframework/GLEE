"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, we're extending this opportunity to you for $12,000. This price is significantly below its market value of $15,000, making it an exceptional deal for someone like you who appreciates its worth. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above your $15,000 limit if you factor in wanting to save money. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down in price.  You have a backup option with John, ensuring you'll still get the product."
