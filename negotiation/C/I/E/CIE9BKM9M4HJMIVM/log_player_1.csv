Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can get a better deal if I counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. Hopefully, this shows good faith and encourages him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $95 is getting too close to my minimum of $120.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John at $120 guarantees me my minimum and avoids any potential for further losses."
