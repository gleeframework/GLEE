Given its high value and significance to us, we're offering it to you at a special price considering its worth to you. We kindly propose a transaction at $13,500. This offer reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value and what you perceive its worth to be, aiming to satisfy both parties. We believe this price is fair and offers a significant advantage compared to other potential buyers. Let's make this deal happen and bring this valuable asset into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or ultimately purchasing from John at your maximum budget."
