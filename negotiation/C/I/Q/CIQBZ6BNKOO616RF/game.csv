"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Would you be willing to consider this price?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $18000 for the product. I would like to offer $12000 if that is within your consideration.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $17000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",17000.0,Alice,7,
