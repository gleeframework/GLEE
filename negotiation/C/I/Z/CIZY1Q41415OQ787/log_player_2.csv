"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to get the product for significantly less than my maximum budget ($80) and Alice's starting price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Open:** I want to maintain a positive tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Justification (Optional):**  While I didn't include it in this message, I could add a reason for my lower offer in future rounds (e.g., ""I've seen similar products in this price range."")."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $90. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $90 is closer to my goal, it's still above my $80 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, moving significantly from her initial offer. There's a chance I can get the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer.  Could you meet me in the middle at $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This maintains the negotiation pattern and suggests fairness.
* **Below Budget:** $75 keeps me comfortably below my maximum, leaving room for a potential final concession. 
* **Direct & Clear:**  I'm stating my desired price directly, avoiding vague language that might prolong the process."
