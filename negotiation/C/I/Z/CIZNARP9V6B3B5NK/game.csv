"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable item that I'm sure you'll find impressive. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1800000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $1500000 for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $1500000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $1700000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $1700000 is closer, I still feel that we might be able to reach a more equitable agreement. Could you possibly lower the price to $1600000? I believe this would better align with both our interests.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum target. How about we meet in the middle at $1650000? This is the lowest I can go, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1625000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be within your acceptable range while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
