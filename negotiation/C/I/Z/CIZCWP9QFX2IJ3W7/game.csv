"Hey Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would need a lower price to make it work. How about $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I can do $135, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. If you're not able to go that low, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,4,
