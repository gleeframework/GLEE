"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I'm on a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

While I'm still hoping to get a bit more, I'm concerned that we're getting too far away from my minimum price point.  $7,800 is too low. I'll take the $8,000 from John and move on."
