Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  This also leaves room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum value ($150).  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum value ($150) but lower than my initial offer ($180). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $140 is below my initial goal, it's still above my minimum value ($150). It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a much better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent profit."
