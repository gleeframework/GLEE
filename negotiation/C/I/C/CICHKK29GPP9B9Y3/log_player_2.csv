"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to him. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price.** While Bob would prefer to pay $130, Alice's offer of $135 is within his budget and represents a significant discount from her initial price.
* **Time is a factor.**  With only 10 rounds, Bob can't afford to be too stubborn and risk losing out on the deal altogether. 
* **John's offer is a fallback.**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he can still buy from John, though at a higher price.  This gives him some leverage in negotiations, but it's not a preferable outcome.

In this scenario, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a fair price, and he avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down or having to pay more to John."
