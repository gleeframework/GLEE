Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
