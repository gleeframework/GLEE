I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will be interested in the product and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. While I wanted to get more, I don't think I'll be able to get significantly closer to my desired price with Bob."
