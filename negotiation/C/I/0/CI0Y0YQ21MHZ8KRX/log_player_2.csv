"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is above your maximum valuation. It's best to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Your goal is to save as much money as possible.  Offering $80 gives you a good starting point to potentially get the product for a price significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price. 
* **Respectful Communication:**  The message maintains a polite and respectful tone, important for keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $90 is still above your target price. You have room to counteroffer again and see if you can get closer to $80 or even lower. Buying from John at $100 is still an option if the negotiation doesn't move in your favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, Alice.  How about $85?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 85}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Slightly:**  Showing willingness to increase your offer, even incrementally, demonstrates that you are engaging in good faith and are interested in reaching an agreement.
* **Setting a Limit:**  By firmly stating that $85 is your final offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about your budget and may be willing to walk away if she doesn't accept.
* **Creating Urgency:** By indicating you're ""ready to close the deal"" you add a subtle pressure that might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she is keen on making the sale."
