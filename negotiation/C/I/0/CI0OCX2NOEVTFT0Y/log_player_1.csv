Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a slightly lower price.  I'm sure you'll find it valuable, but I understand this is a significant investment. Let's find a price that works for both of us.  How does $1,500,000 sound?  "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  This message emphasizes the value of the product to Alice while also acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay the full amount. It sets the stage for negotiation and implies that a lower price is possible.
* **Product Price:**  $1,500,000 is a starting point for negotiation. It is higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price, giving her room to bargain down. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Focus on Value:** By highlighting the product's worth, it creates a sense of opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message suggests flexibility, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** The price is higher than Alice's minimum, giving her room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher sale price."
