"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try to negotiate and get a better price.  $5,000 is a great deal, but there's no guarantee that you can't get it even lower.  You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount right away.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down from her initial offer.  $4,000 is still a good value for me, but it gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,500 is a good price, I'm still holding out for a lower price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try to get closer to my target of $4,000.  I'm confident that I can get there by continuing to counteroffer and negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $4,000 to $4,200. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. However, I'm still keeping the price lower than her offer of $4,500. This approach could potentially encourage her to accept my counteroffer or make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,600 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not willing to settle for that price.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth a few more rounds to try and get closer to my ideal price point.  I'm not in a rush, and I have plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4400}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $4,400. This demonstrates that I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still keeping the price lower than Alice's offer of $4,600. This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept my offer. I'm also hoping that this counteroffer might lead to a meeting point closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still not willing to accept Alice's offer of $4,700.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  With only three rounds left, the pressure is increasing, but I believe I can secure a price closer to my goal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer to $4,500, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. This shows Alice I'm serious about closing the deal but also willing to pay a fair price. It's a good compromise with only two rounds remaining. If Alice rejects this, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $4,800 is getting closer to my target, but with only one round left, there is no time to negotiate further.  I'm not confident I can get Alice to agree on my preferred price.  It's better to accept John's offer of $12,000 than risk getting stuck with a higher price. It's important to recognize that my time is valuable, and it's better to make a decision that guarantees me the product within my budget."
