"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $925,000, so how about $887,500?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $887,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go above $887,500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm considering buying the product from John for $1,000,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",887500.0,Bob,6,
