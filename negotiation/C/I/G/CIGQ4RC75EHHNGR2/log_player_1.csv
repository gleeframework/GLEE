Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. I'm willing to pay up to $10,500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has stated this is his final offer. Accepting $10,500 is significantly better than John's $8,000 offer. Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of ending in no deal with Bob, forcing me to accept the lower guaranteed amount."
