Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,200. At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield significant savings. It's more advantageous to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid potentially protracted negotiations with Alice."
