"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $950000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire an asset valued at $1000000 for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This means you can potentially save money by negotiating further.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice is selling for $800,000, so there's a significant gap between her cost and her offer.  
* **You have a backup option.** Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed alternative if the negotiation fails.

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer Alice with a price lower than $950,000 but still higher than $800,000 to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value and provides you with a comfortable profit margin. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to propose a price of $925000 for the product. This still allows for a significant profit while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to your desired price.** While $925,000 is still higher than your initial counteroffer of $900,000, it's a significant improvement from her original $950,000. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk.**  You could potentially get a lower price, but there's also a chance Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd have to pay John's higher price.
* **Accepting saves time and effort.**  By accepting, you avoid further negotiation rounds and secure the product at a price within your budget.

**While you could try for a lower price, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John.**"
