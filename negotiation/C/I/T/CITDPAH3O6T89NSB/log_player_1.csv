Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $149 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John if Bob refuses.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately at $149, but it keeps me close to my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
