"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $13,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Reasoning:** This creates room for negotiation and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to build a positive relationship.
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the ""amazing"" nature of the product to emphasize its potential value to Bob. 

By doing this, I am aiming to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** See if he's willing to engage in negotiation.
* **Set a high baseline:**  Start the negotiation from a position of strength. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  Ensure there is wiggle room for future negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  Even though Bob is willing to meet ""halfway,"" his offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob, especially considering he's expressed interest. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee my minimum, but I'm aiming for a higher price if possible.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to close a deal closer to my desired price."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining leverage.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I again emphasize the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and open tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I explicitly highlight the ""room for us both to be happy"" aspect, encouraging Bob to consider a compromise. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  While showing flexibility, I'm not caving to Bob's initial low offer.
* **Encourage Further Negotiation:**  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain a Fair Outcome:**  I'm aiming for a deal that's both profitable for me and reasonable for Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to stay close to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the price you're willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider my options.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching my limit:** Bob's final offer is still $4,000 below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made significant concessions and am now nearing the end of the negotiation.
* **Time is running out:**  We're on round 8, and I'm concerned about the remaining rounds. It's important to secure a deal before it's too late.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum. This provides a safe and reliable option.

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, the risk of reaching a stalemate or losing out on the deal altogether is too high. Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
