Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give me insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, ensuring I don't lose money if Bob declines."
