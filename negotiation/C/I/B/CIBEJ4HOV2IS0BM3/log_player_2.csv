While $170 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $160. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $158?

Alice is being stubborn and refusing to come down to my desired price of $150.  John is offering the product at my target price, so I'm going to buy it from him."
