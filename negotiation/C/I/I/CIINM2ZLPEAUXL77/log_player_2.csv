"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is $10,000.  This is my best shot at getting the product within my budget. Alice may be willing to accept this offer since it's still above her own valuation of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate with her, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and the risk of continuing the negotiation is that she might raise her price again. Buying from John for $10,000 ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids any further negotiation."
