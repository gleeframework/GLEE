"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above the price I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $580000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the discount you've already offered. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",580000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $620000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and the efforts I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll sell the product to you for $620000. This is my final offer.",620000.0,Alice,5,
