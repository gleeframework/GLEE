"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $140. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $150.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
