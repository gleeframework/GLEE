"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price early on.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my starting point, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can get from Bob at this point, and I'm not willing to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with him. It's time to accept the deal and move on."
