"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no point in accepting Alice's offer at this point.  Since we don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's a chance she'd be willing to sell for less. Rejecting allows us to try and negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John now offers no advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it's important to start negotiating aggressively.  If Alice rejects this offer, it gives us valuable information about her minimum acceptable price, helping us make informed decisions in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my target price of $1,000,000.  There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows me to continue pushing for a better deal. Buying from John right now would be worse than accepting Alice's offer, but I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, moving from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000.  This counteroffer represents a further step towards my desired price point, while still being a reasonable compromise. It leaves room for potential further concessions, while also demonstrating my commitment to getting a good deal."
