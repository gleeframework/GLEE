"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? ",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's make this deal happen!",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $990,000.  This is a very competitive offer and I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,
