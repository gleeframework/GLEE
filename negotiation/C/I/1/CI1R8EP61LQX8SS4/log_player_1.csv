This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also setting a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $990,000.  This is a very competitive offer and I need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm concerned we're at an impasse.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, my minimum price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'll take his offer and end the negotiations with Bob."
