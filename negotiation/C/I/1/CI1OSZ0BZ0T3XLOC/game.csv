"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is well above my budget. I'm happy to pay up to $8,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,000. I'm thinking of $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
