"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential value difference.  This gives us room to negotiate while still getting a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to gain a good profit while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer more, it's a significant improvement over selling to John, and the negotiations are getting close to a reasonable end."
