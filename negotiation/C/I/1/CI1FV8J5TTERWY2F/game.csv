"I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $120 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $95 for the product. I really want to get this deal done, but that's the most I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $105, and that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit too high. I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is the absolute max I can do.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",100.0,Bob,6,
