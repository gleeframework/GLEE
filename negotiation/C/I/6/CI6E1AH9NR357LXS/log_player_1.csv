"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also being optimistic and hoping to get a price closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $1,000,000. I have John as a backup option, and I believe I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my offer to $1,100,000, which is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down on the price, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $1,000,000. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or go with John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000, which is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000. This demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.  I'm also signaling to Bob that this is my final offer, putting pressure on him to decide.  At this point, I'm prepared to go with John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down on the price, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and while Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  With John waiting in the wings to pay me my full asking price, it's time to take the guaranteed deal.  I've shown flexibility and negotiated in good faith, but ultimately, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum."
