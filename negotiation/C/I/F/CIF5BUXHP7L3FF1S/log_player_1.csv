Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a compromise, but it still reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm confident that I can secure the full $15,000 from John, so I'll end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
