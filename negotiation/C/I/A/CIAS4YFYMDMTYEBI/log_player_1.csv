Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000, but I'm willing to compromise to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both have our bottom lines, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $9,750 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum and closer to my initial offer.  It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower price."
