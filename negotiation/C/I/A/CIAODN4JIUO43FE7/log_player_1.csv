"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be even more valuable for your business.  I'm asking for $900,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my ideal target.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build a good rapport with Bob from the start.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping it will encourage him to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $750,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and far below the product's potential value to Bob. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Strategic Delay:** By continuing the negotiation, I can potentially get closer to my target price while also avoiding a quick sale to John, which would only yield me $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still provides a significant gain for you while remaining fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's midway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reiterating the product's potential value to Bob to reinforce that a higher price is justified.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the benefits for both parties.

**Strategy:** By continuing the negotiation and offering a slightly lower price, I'm aiming to find a compromise that both Bob and I can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Gain:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there is no guarantee I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, there is a risk of losing time and potentially needing to sell to John at the same price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
