"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",13500.0,Bob,6,
