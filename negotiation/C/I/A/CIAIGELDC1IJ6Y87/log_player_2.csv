```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground while still staying below his maximum price.  Offering $10,750 is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing he is willing to compromise, but also a significant discount from Alice's offer.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this deal â€“ I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is the best price Bob has received so far, and it is still below his maximum price of $12,000.  It's likely that Alice is serious about this being her final offer, so rejecting it could risk losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a good price, meeting his goal of saving money."
