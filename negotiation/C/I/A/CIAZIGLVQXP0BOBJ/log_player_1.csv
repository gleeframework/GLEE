"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is fair considering what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Explanation: Bob is offering the absolute minimum we'd accept for the product. There's no room for negotiation to make more money. We can get the same price from John with no hassle."
