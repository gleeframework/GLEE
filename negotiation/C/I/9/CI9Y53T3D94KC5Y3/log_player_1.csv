Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise between your minimum desired price of $1,200,000 and Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. It gives Bob a good deal, incentivizing him to accept, while still securing a profit for you. 

If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum desired price, so there's no risk in offering a slightly higher price to Bob."
