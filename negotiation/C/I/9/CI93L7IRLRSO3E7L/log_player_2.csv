"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also ensures a fair profit for me. I'm confident you'll find this investment valuable. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with John or find an even better deal elsewhere."
