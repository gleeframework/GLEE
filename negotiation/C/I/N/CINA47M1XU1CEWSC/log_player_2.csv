"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm starting at $13,000, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject the offer.  $13,000 is still too high for him, and he has 9 more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. How about $12,000? That leaves us both with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. He can likely still get the product for less than $12,000. He has another 7 rounds to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
