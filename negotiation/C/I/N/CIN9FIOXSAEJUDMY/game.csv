"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
