"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable asset. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great chance for you to acquire it at a discounted rate. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a price that fits his budget."
