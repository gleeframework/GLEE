"Alice, your offer is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying over $1 million. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This reflects its value to me, while leaving some room for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, my valuation for this product is significantly higher, reflecting its true potential. Let's meet in the middle; I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,200,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to consider a more substantial move on my end if it means closing this deal. How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
