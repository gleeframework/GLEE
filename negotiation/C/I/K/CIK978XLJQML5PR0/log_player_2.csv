"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the market value.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is still a great deal considering the market value of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and is closer to his valuation. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for a good price while saving $2,500 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there is a risk of Alice rejecting future offers and ultimately leading to a price closer to John's offer."
