"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I value your business, $9,500 is a little too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product and also leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but no higher. Can you consider my revised offer?",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution here.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This price is fair, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider my revised offer?",9900.0,Bob,8,
