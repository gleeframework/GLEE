Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
