"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for the price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  By stating the product's value to Bob, we create a basis for the high price and frame the negotiation in terms of mutual benefit.
* **Alternative:** Keeping the John offer in mind ($1,000,000), we have a strong fallback option if negotiations don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is our exact minimum. While we could accept and close the deal now, we have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. We are still early in the negotiation process (only round 2 out of 10), and rejecting this offer signals that we see the product's value as higher. We will aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within a certain budget. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This recognizes the product's significant value while still offering you a considerable gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've come down from our initial offer, signaling flexibility, but we're still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Highlighting Value and Gain:** We're reiterating the product's value proposition to Bob, emphasizing the potential profit he stands to make even at this adjusted price. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While we're open to negotiation, we're not drastically dropping our price. This keeps the negotiation moving but demonstrates that we value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly settle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a palatable compromise, we're still leaving potential profit on the table. We have time and room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a slightly higher price, but we're willing to continue the discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  This feels like a fair deal where we both benefit."", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're proposing a price exactly between our previous offer and Bob's last counteroffer. This demonstrates our willingness to make a deal while still aiming for a price above our minimum. 
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  By positioning the offer as mutually beneficial, we appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal while emphasizing the value he's receiving. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While we have time remaining, we don't want to drag out negotiations unnecessarily. This offer pushes for a resolution while leaving room for minor adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still a significant profit margin above our $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for a small increase in price (like $25,000) might frustrate Bob and risk losing the deal entirely.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means we get the money sooner, which is always advantageous in business. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer outweighs the potential reward at this point. It's a good business decision to accept this offer and secure a profitable outcome."
