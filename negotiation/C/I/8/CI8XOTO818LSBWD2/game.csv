"Bob, I understand your desire to save, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
