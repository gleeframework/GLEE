Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of getting a better offer from him.  Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price."
