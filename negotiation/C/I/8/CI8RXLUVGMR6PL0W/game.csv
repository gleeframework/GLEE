,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $102.50, so how about $98.75?",98.75,Bob,4,
