"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,000,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  I'm confident this price will still represent a great value for you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,125,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. ",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,100,000.  This price gives us both a good deal and allows us to close the transaction quickly. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal quickly.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come up.  $1,075,000 is closer, but it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  $1,087,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $1,062,500. This would be a final offer for me, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly and fairly.  Let me know what you think.",1062500.0,Bob,8,
