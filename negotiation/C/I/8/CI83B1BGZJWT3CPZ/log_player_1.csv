Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value ($1,000,000), but significantly lower than my minimum price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **First round, first offer:**  I'm being aggressive in the first round, trying to get Bob to bite before he has a chance to think too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. I have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,000,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  I'm confident this price will still represent a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also sending a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,125,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,100,000.

Round 6
