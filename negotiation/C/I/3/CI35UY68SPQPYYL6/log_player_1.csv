"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:**  Starting with a high price establishes a strong baseline for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  Mentioning the product's ""significant value"" implies that the price is justified, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, allowing for flexibility in subsequent rounds without appearing too desperate. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message explicitly invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob is likely to be interested in the product. If you have no information about Bob's potential value for the product, it might be wiser to start with a lower offer to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Floor:** Bob's offer matches the minimum value you're willing to accept for the product ($800,000). 
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely that Bob will offer a higher price in future rounds, given his initial counteroffer.
* **Risk of Delay:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to more rounds of back-and-forth, potentially taking time and potentially leading to no deal at all. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price. 

While it's tempting to try and push for a higher price, the risk of losing the sale and the possibility of a long negotiation outweigh the potential benefits of a slightly higher price. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
