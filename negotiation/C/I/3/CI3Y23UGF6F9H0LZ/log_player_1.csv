Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message hints at the product's value and the exclusivity of this offer, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could experiment with different price points and messaging to see what yields the best results in a real-world scenario."
