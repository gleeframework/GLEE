"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice, but $140 is still a bit much for me. How about we meet halfway at $120? That seems fair to me.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $120 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
