"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's $1,000 lower. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some negotiation room while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Since he can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming to stay within his budget. $9,500 is a reasonable middle ground, and if Alice is serious about selling, she might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his ideal price. Since he can buy the product for $10,000 from John, there's no reason to accept this offer. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum price of $10,000. This is the price he can get from John, and it's within his budget.  He is showing a willingness to meet Alice's needs while still ensuring he gets the product at the lowest possible price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have no reason to continue negotiating with her and will simply purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still slightly higher than what Bob can get from John. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price, especially since he has limited rounds remaining. There's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking with his previous offer of $10,000. Since this is the price he can get from John, it's the absolute minimum he's willing to pay.  If Alice is serious about selling, she should accept this offer. If she rejects it, Bob will simply buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round of negotiations. Alice's offer of $10,100 is still higher than what Bob can get from John. There is no point in further negotiation because:

* **Limited Rounds:** Bob has only one round left, so even if he makes a counteroffer, there might not be enough time to reach a deal.
* **Guaranteed Price:** John is offering the product at Bob's desired price of $10,000. It's a safe and guaranteed option.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to choose option (3) and buy the product from John to avoid any further risk or uncertainty."
