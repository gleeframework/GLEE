"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
