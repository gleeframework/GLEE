"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's making a significant counteroffer. 
* **Fairness:**  He's not going too low, as that could risk Alice rejecting the counteroffer. $125 is still a decent profit for Alice, considering her value is $100.
* **Next steps:** Bob can adjust his counteroffers based on Alice's responses, aiming to find a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down in price, $132.50 is still above Bob's target of saving as much as possible.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  There's still room for further negotiation. Bob can try to get closer to his desired price by making another counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John would be more expensive and less desirable at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** Bob is showing he's willing to negotiate but is still trying to stay close to his initial counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a balance:**  $130 is a reasonable compromise, offering a decent profit for Alice while still allowing Bob to save.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  By continuing to negotiate, Bob is showing Alice he's serious about buying the product."
