{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $950,000, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value, and John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
 
I'm offering Bob $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still within a range where both of us can benefit from a deal. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies our both needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $1,050,000. I'm coming down further, but I'm still holding firm on my value for the product. This is a final attempt to meet in the middle before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're getting close to a possible agreement, but his offer is still too low. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a price we're both comfortable with. I'm also keeping in mind John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
``` 

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm coming down to $1,025,000, which is very close to Bob's offer.  I'm hopeful that he'll accept this offer, but if not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. I've gone through many rounds, and I'm concerned that we'll never reach a deal. 

John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best choice to ensure I don't miss out on a valuable sale."
