"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $18,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we potentially agree on something around $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I have a firm budget.  To be honest, anything over $11,000 is pushing it for me. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, she's still very far from a reasonable price.  She's dropped $5,000, but is still at $13,000.  It's unlikely she'll come down to a price near your $8,000 backup plan in the remaining rounds.  Cut your losses and buy from John."
