"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we potentially agree on something around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a firm budget.  To be honest, anything over $11,000 is pushing it for me. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",13000.0,Alice,7,
