{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, giving me some room to negotiate.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $160?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth that price."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for a higher price,  Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum price of $150. Accepting his offer is the best option as it avoids further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
