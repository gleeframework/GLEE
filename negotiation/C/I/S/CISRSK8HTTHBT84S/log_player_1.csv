"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm going to counter with $102. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where he'll accept. I'm still aiming for a profit, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100."
