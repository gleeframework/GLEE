"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $110. Would you be interested?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference at $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $108. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",108.0,Alice,5,
