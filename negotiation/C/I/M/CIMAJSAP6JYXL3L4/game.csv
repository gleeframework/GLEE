"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've mentioned. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent potential warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer and recognizes its true worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I acknowledge the product's potential, $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part and shows my serious interest in this product.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
