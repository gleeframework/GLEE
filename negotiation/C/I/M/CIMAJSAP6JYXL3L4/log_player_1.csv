Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've mentioned. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent potential warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I acknowledge the product's potential, $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part and shows my serious interest in this product.  Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below John's standing offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap sufficiently to warrant continuing with Bob.  Selling to John ensures I get the product's full value for me."
