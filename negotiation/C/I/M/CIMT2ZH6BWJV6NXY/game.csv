"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point. I'm very interested in this product, but $2000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1200000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we could get a conversation started. However, I have to say that $1200000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1600000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
