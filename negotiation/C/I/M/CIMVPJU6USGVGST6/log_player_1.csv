{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit significantly above my minimum.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for your product. This still allows me to make a profit while ensuring that I am getting a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly below the value I believe the product holds.  I'm confident we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.  I will counteroffer and try to push the price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not comfortable with that price.  It's still too far below the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $880,000 for this to make sense for me.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $860,000 for your product. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while allowing me to acquire it within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $860,000 is getting close to my minimum.  It's still a significant profit for me and avoids the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower price. I'll accept this offer."
