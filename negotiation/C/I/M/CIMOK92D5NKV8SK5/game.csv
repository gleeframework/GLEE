,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about we start at $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $100. That way we both get what we want.",100.0,Bob,4,
