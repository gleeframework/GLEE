Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  I believe it holds significant worth for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation while still staying significantly above your fallback price of $800,000.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy seeks to find a balance between ambition and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
