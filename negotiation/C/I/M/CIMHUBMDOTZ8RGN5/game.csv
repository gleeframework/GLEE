"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'll sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and allows us to close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I get a decent return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
