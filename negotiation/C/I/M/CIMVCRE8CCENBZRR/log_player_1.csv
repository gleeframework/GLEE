"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and provides insight into his negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have the option to walk away and accept John's offer of $1,500,000 at any time if negotiations with Bob are not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 remains significantly higher than his perceived value of $1,200,000. This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aiming for a higher price and are willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **John as a Back-up:** Having John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a safety net. While $1,800,000 is a good offer, it's worth trying to negotiate further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I recognize your interest, my valuation of the product is significantly higher. I'd be willing to part with it for $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $100,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to see how much further Bob is willing to go and how he responds to smaller concessions.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** The offer is still significantly above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a substantial profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market demand and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Limit:**  While Bob is moving closer to your minimum, $1,700,000 is still a significant amount above his perceived value. There's a chance he might be willing to go a bit higher.
* **Negotiation Tactics:**  Continuing to reject offers keeps the pressure on Bob and reinforces the idea that you have other options (John).
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds left. A firm rejection now might encourage Bob to make a more substantial jump in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,825,000.  This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By framing this as your ""final offer,"" you increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The price of $1,825,000 is a midpoint between your last offer and his last counteroffer, signaling a degree of flexibility but also firmness. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With half the rounds remaining, it's important to start steering toward a close, whether that's a deal with Bob or accepting John's offer.
* **Walk Away Preparedness:** While the goal is to maximize profit, be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet this offer. Accepting John's $1,500,000 is still a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,650,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market demand and the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is getting too close to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to yield smaller and smaller concessions. It's not worth the risk of ending up with a deal significantly lower than $1,500,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer represents a guaranteed profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further haggling with Bob. It's time to take the safe and profitable option."
