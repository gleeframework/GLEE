{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but it gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still more than your minimum of $120, leaving you some wiggle room if Bob makes a lower counteroffer.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not too aggressive, but it shows you're serious about selling.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $120 and even significantly lower than my initial offer of $100. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $90 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $82.5 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $82.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $82, that's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $82 is getting close to my minimum price, I've already negotiated with Bob for a while and it's not likely he'll go any higher. To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
