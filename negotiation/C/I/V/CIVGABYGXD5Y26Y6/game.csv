"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $90 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle. ",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $82.50?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $82.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $82, that's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me there?",82.0,Bob,6,
