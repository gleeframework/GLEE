Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident it's worth a great deal. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value; however, I'm confident in the product's worth and need to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway between our two offers at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so how about $13,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, his offer is getting too far away from my minimum. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is already offering.  It's time to move on to a surer deal."
