Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to make a profit beyond my minimum.  I'm confident that I can reach a deal that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
