{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows for negotiation and leaves room for you to potentially earn a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point, and the best negotiation strategy will depend on factors like your urgency to sell, Bob's financial situation, and your assessment of his interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your target. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John.  You can use this opportunity to test Bob's commitment and gauge his potential for further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. Let's find common ground and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than your target. You have a strong alternative with John, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below your minimum.  Continue negotiating with Bob, but be prepared to walk away if the price doesn't reach your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $920,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 935000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $915,000 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, the negotiation seems to be stalled and Bob might not be willing to go higher.  You've already received a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. It's time to secure that sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not yield a better result."
