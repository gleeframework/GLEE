"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. Can you consider it?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This recognizes the product's value while still offering you a significant deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,750,000. Can you consider it?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm eager to find an agreement, I can't go as low as $1,750,000.  My final offer is $1,825,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my strong desire to see this deal closed. Let me know your decision.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement. My final counteroffer is $1,700,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
