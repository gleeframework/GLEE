I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit significantly higher than my minimum. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,750 is still a good deal for me and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower amount."
