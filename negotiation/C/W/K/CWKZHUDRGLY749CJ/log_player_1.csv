Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still closer to what I want than selling to John.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway.  I believe it's a fair price, and I'm hopeful he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is too low for me.  While I'm trying to get the best price,  I'm not willing to go that low. I'd rather sell to John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
