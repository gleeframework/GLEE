Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $174. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 174
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $100, we want to start with an offer above his valuation to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""limited time"" and emphasizing ""value,"" we create a sense of urgency and try to subtly shift Bob's focus from the price alone.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The price of $174 is strategically chosen. It's higher than what Bob wants to pay but lower than what John guarantees. This keeps the possibility of a deal with Bob alive while ensuring we don't lose out on our minimum sale price.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to see if Bob will counter-offer.  If he does, we can then negotiate down towards his $100 valuation, aiming to get as close to $150 as possible. If Bob outright rejects this initial offer, we can always fall back on selling to John for our guaranteed $150."
