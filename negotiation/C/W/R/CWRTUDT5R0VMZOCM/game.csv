"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is considerably higher than that. I could come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we seem pretty far apart still.  I can appreciate the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $1,250,000.  Does that work for you?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe you would greatly benefit from this product. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction and a very strong offer.  Please think it over carefully.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down. I understand you have another buyer, but to be honest $1,750,000 is  still more than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute final offer is $1,400,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to pass and see what else is out there.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
