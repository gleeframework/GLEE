"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer. While I value our potential partnership, $1,000,000 is unfortunately too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can make this work!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I'll get from the product and the price you're willing to accept.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly more to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, as it's the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
