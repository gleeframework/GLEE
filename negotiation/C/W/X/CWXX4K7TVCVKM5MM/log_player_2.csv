"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to start. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I value the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, and while you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings. It's a good deal for you, and the negotiation has reached a reasonable point."
