"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is closer to her value than yours. There's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($90) attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While aggressive, it leaves space to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects the offer.
* **Polite and positive:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the chance of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum.  Since you have the option of buying from John for $100, it's worth seeing if you can get Alice closer to that price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, though. How about $95?  That's a pretty good compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Shows willingness to compromise but in smaller steps.
* **Reiterates budget:**  Keeps your constraint top of mind for Alice.
* **Seeks agreement:**  Framing it as a ""compromise"" aims for a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $105, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably and is now only $5 above your alternative option (John).  While you *might* be able to squeeze out another dollar or two, it's getting risky. Accepting at $105 secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
