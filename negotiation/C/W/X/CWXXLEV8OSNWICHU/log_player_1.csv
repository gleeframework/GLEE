Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is getting closer to my minimum, and there's always the risk he walks away.  $95 is a solid profit, and a sure thing is better than risking a no-deal at this point."
