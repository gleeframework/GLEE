"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $18000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $12000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $15000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're at a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can seal the deal at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your consideration, Alice. I understand your position and respect your final offer. I would like to counter with a price of $15000. This is my best offer, and I hope it aligns with what you're willing to accept.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession at $16000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $15000, which is $15500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",15500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make another offer. However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $15500. I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm concerned that we might be getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need to be confident that we're at a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $15750. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal at this price.",15750.0,Alice,9,
