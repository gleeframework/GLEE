"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my budget. I believe this is a good starting point for further discussion. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I am willing to come down to $1,600,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution. This price still reflects the product's significant value and the potential it holds for you. I'm confident this offer is fair and encourages further discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value this product holds for me, I'm willing to pay $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my interest in acquiring the product while staying within my budget. I believe this is a strong offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
