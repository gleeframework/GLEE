Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I am willing to come down to $1,600,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution. This price still reflects the product's significant value and the potential it holds for you. I'm confident this offer is fair and encourages further discussion.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's closer than the initial offer, it's still not acceptable.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Since John is willing to sell for $1,500,000, Bob has a benchmark to work with and can counteroffer closer to that price."
