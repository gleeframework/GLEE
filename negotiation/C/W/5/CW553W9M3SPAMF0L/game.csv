"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $1,250,000.  I believe that's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let's make this happen!",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",1350000.0,Alice,5,
