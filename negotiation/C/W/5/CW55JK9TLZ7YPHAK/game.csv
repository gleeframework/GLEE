"Alice, that initial price is quite steep. I appreciate the product's value, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, that price is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000 and see if we can find an agreement there.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
