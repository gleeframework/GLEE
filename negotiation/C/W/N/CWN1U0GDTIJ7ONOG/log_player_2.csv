"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your serious intention to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $10,000 is still within your budget and leaves room for some negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping the message friendly helps maintain a good relationship while pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice has come down a bit, there's still space to get a better price.  You can afford to go a little higher, but not to $11,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to see if she's truly willing to lower the price further. If she rejects your next counteroffer, then you might consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but are still trying to save money. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, making it sound like you're both working towards a solution.
* **Pressure Point:** If Alice rejects this offer, you're close to your limit and may consider going to John."
