"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the potential value to Bob. This should encourage him to consider my offer and make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still slightly below my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a firm stance on my value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and while $10,500 isn't ideal, it's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept his offer and secure a sale that's above my minimum requirement."
