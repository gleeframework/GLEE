Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as high as $610,000.

This is a final compromise that I believe is reasonable and reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $615,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $615,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly sticking to a slow descent in price. While I might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's getting riskier. Accepting at $615,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
