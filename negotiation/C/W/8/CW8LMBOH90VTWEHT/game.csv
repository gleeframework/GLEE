,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $16000? This is a compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go lower than that.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14500.  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",14500.0,Bob,6,
