"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, and allows for a reasonable profit margin. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price still allows you a substantial profit and is a fair reflection of the product's value. I believe this is a fair compromise that we can both agree on.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
