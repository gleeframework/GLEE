Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my target price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at my maximum desired price. It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
