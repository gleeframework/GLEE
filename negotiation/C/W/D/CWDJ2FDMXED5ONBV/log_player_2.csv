"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has a clear advantage since he knows Alice's minimum selling price is $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum selling price but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a fair price.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is still better than buying from John, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and more than Bob wants to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise.  $900,000 is a midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, indicating a willingness to meet halfway. This approach could potentially lead to a quicker agreement and avoid further back and forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high.  At this point, the negotiation is going back and forth, and it's unclear if Bob can get a lower price from Alice.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees Bob will get the product, even though it's not the best deal.  It's a strategic decision to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product."
