"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong baseline and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, but I need to gauge his interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer and significantly higher than John's offer. It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing a potential sale."
