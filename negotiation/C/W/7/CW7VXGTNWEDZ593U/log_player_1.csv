"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price considering the value to Bob ($120) and my minimum requirement ($80). This leaves room for potential negotiation but also secures a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still within my acceptable range, but I can likely do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $102 is very close to my desired price and still significantly higher than selling to John. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
