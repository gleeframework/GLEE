"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefit to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you can save $1,000 by rejecting it. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and John will sell it to you at that price."
