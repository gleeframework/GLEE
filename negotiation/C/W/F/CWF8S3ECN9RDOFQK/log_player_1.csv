Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $145 for it.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects our offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $150."
