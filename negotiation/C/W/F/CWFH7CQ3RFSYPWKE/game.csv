"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  $145 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I offer $140? That's my final offer.",140.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll sell the product to you for $147. It's the best I can do.",147.0,Alice,7,
