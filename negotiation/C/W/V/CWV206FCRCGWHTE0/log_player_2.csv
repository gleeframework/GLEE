"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for a price that reflects its value. I'm asking $1,150,000. This price gives you a good deal, and allows me to get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It allows you a good profit margin while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is below Alice's offer:**  Bob is trying to lower the price, but still offering a price that's higher than Alice's minimum value. 
* **Reasoning is clear and reasonable:**  Bob explains his reasoning for the counteroffer, focusing on fairness and a win-win scenario.
* **Not too aggressive:** Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,100,000. This price still gives you a good value for the product while allowing me a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue lowering the price and potentially secure a better deal.  It's still early in the negotiation process, and rejecting a slightly better offer keeps Bob in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This price allows me to make the purchase while still giving you a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continues to push for a lower price:** Bob is still trying to reduce the price, but he's also showing flexibility by moving closer to Alice's last offer.
* **Offers a compromise:** By proposing to ""split the difference,"" Bob shows that he's serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Reiterates the value for Alice:** Bob emphasizes that the offer is still profitable for Alice, making it more appealing for her to consider."
