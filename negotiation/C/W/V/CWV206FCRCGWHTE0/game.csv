"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for a price that reflects its value. I'm asking $1,150,000. This price gives you a good deal, and allows me to get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It allows you a good profit margin while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,100,000. This price still gives you a good value for the product while allowing me a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This price allows me to make the purchase while still giving you a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
