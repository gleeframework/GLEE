Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

This takes into account:

* **Your Minimum:** You have a solid backup offer from John at $15,000, ensuring you won't go below that.
* **Bob's Value:**  You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob if he tries to negotiate down. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $19,000. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering the information you have."
