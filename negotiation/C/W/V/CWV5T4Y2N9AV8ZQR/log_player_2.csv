"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $8,000 to you, I propose we make this deal even more attractive. How about we offer it to you for $12,000? This way, you save $2,000 compared to what you're willing to pay, and I ensure a fair return on my investment. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice is offering a ""discount"" compared to my initial valuation, $12,000 is still significantly more than the $8,000 John is willing to sell the product for. I'll save the most money by going with John."
