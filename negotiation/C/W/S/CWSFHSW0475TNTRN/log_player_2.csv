Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is the absolute minimum I can accept, I'm willing to compromise slightly to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle at $1750000. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

While $1,750,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price. You should try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1600000 is still a bit below my minimum.  To move forward, I'd need to receive at least $1650000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and ensure a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than your preferred price point.  You've been actively negotiating, but it seems Alice is firm in her asking price.  It's now in your best interest to move on and purchase the product from John for $1,500,000, securing the best deal within your budget."
