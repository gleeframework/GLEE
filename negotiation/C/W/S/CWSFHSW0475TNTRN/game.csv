"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited to $1500000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? I believe it still reflects the product's value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is the absolute minimum I can accept, I'm willing to compromise slightly to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle at $1750000. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1600000. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1600000 is still a bit below my minimum.  To move forward, I'd need to receive at least $1650000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and ensure a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
