"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant importance to me at a price of $14,000. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the unique benefits and features that make this product stand out. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than your maximum budget and leaves you with little room for negotiation. While her message emphasizes the product's value to *her*, it doesn't change the fact that you can get it for $1,000 less from John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a counter-offer closer to your desired price range. If she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John for $15,000."
