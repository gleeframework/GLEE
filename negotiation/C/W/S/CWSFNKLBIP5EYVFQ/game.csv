,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $17500 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet the price of $17500. I am willing to go up to $16000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
