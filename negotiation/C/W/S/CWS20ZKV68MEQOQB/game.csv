"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market and my specific needs.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my strong desire to find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  However, we're still quite a ways apart.  To be honest, $700,000 is the highest I'm willing to go.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between $700,000 and my minimum price is still quite significant. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to conclude this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be completely transparent, I can purchase a similar product elsewhere for $800,000. I'm willing to go slightly above that to work with you, but $900,000 is still too high. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,6,
