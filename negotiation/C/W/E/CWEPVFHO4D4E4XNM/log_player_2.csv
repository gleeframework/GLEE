Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $825,000. This product is truly unique, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below your $800,000 limit.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your preferred price."
