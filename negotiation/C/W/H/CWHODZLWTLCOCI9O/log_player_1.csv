{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and increase his willingness to pay.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I express a willingness to negotiate, making the offer less intimidating and encouraging Bob to counter. 

This strategy aims to find a price point where I can maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation and potentially securing a sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to offer $95. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for higher price:**  While Bob's offer is lower, he's still interested and willing to negotiate. This indicates there's room to find a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows a willingness to compromise and move closer to his price point.
* **Emphasize the value for Bob:**  I remind Bob that $105 is still a great deal for him, highlighting the value he'll get from the product.
* **Maintain a fair profit:**  $105 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I'm not selling at a loss.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am still not able to go above $95 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm at $95, and I'm unwilling to go below $100.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John offers certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $100. This provides a safe and reliable outcome.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continued negotiation with Bob could drag on and potentially waste time.  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, selling to John ensures I don't lose out on a decent profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
