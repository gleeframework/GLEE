This is a starting point that is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially reach a deal closer to Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. There is still room for negotiation to potentially get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still confident in the value of the product.  This counteroffer is a compromise and hopefully will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  $1,080,000 is a good deal and ensures I get more than my minimum.  It's time to finalize the sale with Bob."
