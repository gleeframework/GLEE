Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob is offering my absolute minimum acceptable price. I need to decide if I want to push for more, risking losing him as a buyer, or accept his offer. 

Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** Guarantees the sale at my minimum, but I miss out on potential profit.
* **Rejecting:** I might get a better price, but Bob might walk away, leaving me with John's offer. 

Since I still have rounds to negotiate, I'll try one more time to push the price slightly higher.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute lowest I could consider.  However, I value your time and interest in this product. Would you consider a final offer of $850,000?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you've made a final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. Can you consider $825,000?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is clearly still interested and negotiating. $825,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. While I could push further, there's a real risk of losing him altogether.
