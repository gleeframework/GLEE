Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000, reflecting the value I see and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to you is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I see in the product, and given your lower limit of $800,000,  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This price strikes a balance and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
