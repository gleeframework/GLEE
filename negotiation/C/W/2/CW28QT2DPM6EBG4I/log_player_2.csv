"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000, reflecting the value I see and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** My counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This allows for room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer by highlighting the value I see in the product. This demonstrates I'm taking the negotiation seriously and am not just throwing out a random number.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further dialogue and show flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to you is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has moved closer to my preferred price, there's still room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial counteroffer of $950,000.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives me a chance to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I see in the product, and given your lower limit of $800,000,  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This price strikes a balance and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm increasing my counteroffer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a good deal.
* **Highlighting potential:** I'm emphasizing the value I see in the product to justify my offer.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm suggesting a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and encourage a positive outcome.
* **Open-ended question:** I leave the door open for further discussion to potentially find a middle ground."
