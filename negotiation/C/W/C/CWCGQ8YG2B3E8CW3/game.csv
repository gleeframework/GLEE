"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and while my ideal price is above your initial estimate, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product fits into my budget closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly on price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more realistic figure. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?  This reflects my willingness to find common ground while acknowledging the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be frank, I have other options closer to $800,000.  If you could come down to $950,000, I think we could reach a deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on making this work. However, to be transparent, I have another offer on the table closer to my asking price.  To avoid losing this opportunity, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent with you, my absolute limit for this product is $850,000.  I believe that's a fair offer, especially considering I have other options available.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore those alternatives.",850000.0,Bob,6,
