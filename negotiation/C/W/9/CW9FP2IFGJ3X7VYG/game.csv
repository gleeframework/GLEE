"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? This would allow us to come closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit far from my ideal price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This price reflects the product's worth and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your proposal, and I'm willing to move forward if we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,060,000? This would still reflect the value of the product while allowing us to stay within my financial limits.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
