"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I think $150 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. I'm willing to go down to $165. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 165}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Would $150 still be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The goal is to maximize profit. While Bob is offering the minimum acceptable price, there are still rounds remaining.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $162.50. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 162.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, could we possibly settle at $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer of $155.  You've already rejected his offer of $150 twice, and you're only at round 6 out of 10.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will become frustrated and walk away, forcing you to sell to John at $150.  Accepting $155 guarantees a profit and is a reasonable compromise."
