"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $1,600,000. It's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's last offer. I hope this shows flexibility and encourages him to come up with a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below where I want to be.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,450,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, and is still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm trying to find that sweet spot where we can both agree. If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at the $1,500,000 price."
