"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves me some wiggle room, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for a product this valuable. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of this product.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
