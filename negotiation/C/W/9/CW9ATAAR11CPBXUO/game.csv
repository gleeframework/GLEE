"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product.  I could consider a price of $1,650,000. This offer represents a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
