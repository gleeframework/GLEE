"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $8000 and its worth to you is $15000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $11500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $10500. I believe that's a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $8000",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $8000 and its worth to you is $15000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
