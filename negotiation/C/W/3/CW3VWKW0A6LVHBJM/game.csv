"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,000 is too far below my value for this.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $6,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,750 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $7,125.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's a price I can accept.",7125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is really getting close! I appreciate you moving on the price.  What if we settle at $7,000 even? That's a solid deal for me, and it gets us over the finish line.",7000.0,Bob,6,
