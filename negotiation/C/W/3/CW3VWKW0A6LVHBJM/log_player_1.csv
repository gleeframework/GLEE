"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can secure a good profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not making a hardline stance, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not going to give away the product cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  I need to explore other options and see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not in a desperate position to accept any low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,000 is too far below my value for this.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $7,500, he's getting a good deal. 
* **Building Towards Agreement:**  I'm aiming to find a price that works for both of us while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $6,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $6,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We've made some progress, and I believe there's still room to negotiate further.
* **John is Still a Good Option:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is still a safe and profitable choice if I can't reach an acceptable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,750 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $7,125.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's a price I can accept."", ""product_price"": 7125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm again offering a price that's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating continued willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing that this price would be ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to his sense of equity.
* **Finality Hint:** I'm subtly hinting that this may be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is really getting close! I appreciate you moving on the price.  What if we settle at $7,000 even? That's a solid deal for me, and it gets us over the finish line. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $7,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that further counteroffers won't lead to a better outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with the option of selling to John for $8,000. The risk of losing a sale altogether outweighs the potential gain of a few hundred dollars."
