"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $750,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise that I hope you'll consider.
