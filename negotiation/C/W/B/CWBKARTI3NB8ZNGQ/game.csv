"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in buying it for $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $80, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was a bit too high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
