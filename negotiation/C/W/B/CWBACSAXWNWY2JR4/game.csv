,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $15000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. Let me know if this works for you.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
