"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his budget of $12,000. It's best to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his preferred price point.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering keeps the negotiation moving, and might get Alice closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's budget, and while there's potential for further negotiation, it's unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's desired price. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for $12,000. This guarantees the purchase within his budget, avoiding further negotiation and potential delays."
