"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value I have in the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,250,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the value I have in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. Let's try $1,225,000. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,225,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If this doesn't work for you, I may have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
