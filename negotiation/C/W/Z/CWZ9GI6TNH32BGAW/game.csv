"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $800,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle on $675,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
