"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you and would be a good starting point for us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $11,500. That's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
