"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet that price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
