"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than our alternative option ($10,000 from John). We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below Alice's asking price and our alternative option.
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. We acknowledge Alice's offer but clearly state our counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Our Limit:** While Alice came down, $10,500 is still more than we want to spend and above John's price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. We can likely meet somewhere between our last offer and her current one.  

We'll continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price but staying firm below $10,000. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Phrasing like ""fair compromise"" emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Pressure Point:** We're getting closer to our walk-away point of $10,000 (John's offer).  Alice may be more inclined to accept as we approach the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginally Better, Still Too High:** Alice is incrementally moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $10,125 is still more expensive than John's offer, even if it's only slightly. 
* **Leverage:** We still have time and the option to go with John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet that price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** It's time to reveal our alternative option to create a sense of urgency and demonstrate the seriousness of our budget constraint. 
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is what we're willing to pay, we're putting the ball in Alice's court.  She can accept our final offer or risk losing the sale.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** Even though we're revealing our position, we want to remain polite and emphasize our preference to work with Alice. This could encourage her to close the deal."
