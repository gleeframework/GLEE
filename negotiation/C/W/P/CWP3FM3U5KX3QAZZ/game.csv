"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only go up to $10000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
