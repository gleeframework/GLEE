"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This price is below his maximum budget but leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. Bob should try to negotiate further to get closer to his target price. He can still try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now pushing closer to his maximum budget and making it clear this is his final offer. This strategy adds pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, Bob has only 5 rounds left and it's unlikely Alice will lower her price significantly.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, guaranteeing him the product within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice risks losing the opportunity to buy from John and potentially ending up with a higher price."
