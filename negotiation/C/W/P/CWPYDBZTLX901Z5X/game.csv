"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. This is a rare opportunity, and I believe it's a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and my current financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the uniqueness and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,200,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of this product.  Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your commitment to the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my comfortable price point. I'm offering $1,150,000, which shows a genuine attempt to bridge the gap between our positions. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
