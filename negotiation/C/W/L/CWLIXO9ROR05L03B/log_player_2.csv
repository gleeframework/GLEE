Considering this, I am offering you the chance to own it at a special introductory price of $14,000. This represents a substantial savings compared to its market value, making it an excellent investment for you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, you can still get it cheaper. Since your maximum price is $15,000, you have room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially get a lower price by counter-offering."
