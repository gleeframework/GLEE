"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose the exact details yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential value. If you're interested in learning more, please let me know.  I'm confident you won't be disappointed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she claims the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to her, that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth that much to you. It's always best to stick to your budget, especially when you have a reliable alternative like buying from John for a lower price."
