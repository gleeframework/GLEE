"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is less than the maximum you're willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and I'm still saving $50,000 compared to my initial maximum price of $1,000,000.  While there's always the chance I could get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or having the negotiation drag on isn't worth the potential small savings."
