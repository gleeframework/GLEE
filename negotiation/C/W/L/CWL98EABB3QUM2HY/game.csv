"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your initial offer, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $10,000?  It's a fair price, and we can close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,6,
