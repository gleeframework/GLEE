,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
