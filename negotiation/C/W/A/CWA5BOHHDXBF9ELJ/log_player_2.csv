Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8750, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to the sweet spot.

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to you.  Since you can buy it from John for $8,000, it's best to go with that option and avoid further negotiation."
