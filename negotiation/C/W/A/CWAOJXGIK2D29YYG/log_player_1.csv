``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $17,500 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly more than Bob initially valued the product for and a solid profit over John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations risks losing Bob altogether. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I could get a better offer from Bob in subsequent rounds."
