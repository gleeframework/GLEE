Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.
