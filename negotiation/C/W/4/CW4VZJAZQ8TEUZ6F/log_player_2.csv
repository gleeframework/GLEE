Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1250000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1400000. Let's compromise - I'm willing to accept $1350000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."
