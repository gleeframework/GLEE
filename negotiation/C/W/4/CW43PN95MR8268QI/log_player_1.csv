{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $80. This allows me to potentially negotiate a higher price, but it's still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my minimum price of $80 and Bob's offer of $70. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $75. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price of $80, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet at $80? It's my absolute minimum, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering $80, my absolute minimum price. This is a final offer to see if Bob will agree. If he rejects it, I'll sell the product to John for $80 to ensure I don't lose money."
