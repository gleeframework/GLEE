"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  It's clear this product is valuable to you. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I can get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your efforts.  However,  $11,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to my target price.  How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will still be very beneficial to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, we are getting close! I'm ready to make this happen. Would you consider $12,000? That's the most I can offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
