"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $14,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $15,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to cover my costs.",15000.0,Alice,5,
