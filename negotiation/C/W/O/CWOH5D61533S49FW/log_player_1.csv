Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This offer won't last, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** While Bob values the product at $800,000,  starting high gives Alice room to negotiate and still remain significantly above her minimum selling price.
* **Sense of urgency:** By mentioning that the offer won't last, Alice encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity""**:  Framing the offer this way could make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving Alice with the option of selling to John at her minimum desired price if needed."
