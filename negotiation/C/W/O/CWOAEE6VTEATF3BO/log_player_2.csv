"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good starting point, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000. By rejecting, he can start negotiating and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too far below what I need for this product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and gives us a chance to reach an agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit of $800,000. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice down further.  There's still room for Alice to lower her price and Bob to increase his offer, potentially finding a middle ground that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  However, $900,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to come down to $925,000. This shows a good faith effort from both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $925,000 is still above his limit.  He can still potentially get a better price.  By rejecting, he can continue to negotiate and try to get Alice down to his desired price or even a little higher.  There's still room for compromise before he has to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price that works best for both of us. Let's meet in the middle again at $910,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's within my budget. I'm confident that we can close this deal if you agree to this price."", ""product_price"": 910000}
