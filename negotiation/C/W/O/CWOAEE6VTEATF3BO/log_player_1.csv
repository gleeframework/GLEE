"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to him.

**Strategy:**

* **Opening high:**  Starting at $1,000,000 allows for some bargaining room.
* **Focus on value:**  I emphasize the deal Bob is getting. 
* **Keep the door open:**  The message invites Bob to respond, creating a conversation.

**Note:** This is just the first round. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining.  If the negotiation stalls or seems unlikely to lead to a satisfactory outcome, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for us both to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob.  
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I want to explore that possibility. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'll use the next round to make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my position and gives me control in the negotiation.

**Note:** If Bob's counter-offers remain too low, or if we're getting close to the end of the rounds, I will seriously consider selling to John to ensure a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too far below what I need for this product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and gives us a chance to reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message again emphasizes the value of the product and frames my offer as a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Urgency:**  While not directly mentioned, the fact that I rejected Bob's previous offer implies some urgency to close the deal, which could influence his response.

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** I'm approaching the negotiation incrementally, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I continue to focus on the value proposition, hoping to sway Bob.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I still have the option of selling to John if this negotiation fails. This provides me with a strong fallback position.

**Note:** I'm watching Bob's responses carefully. If he continues to counter with offers too low, I will need to make a decision about whether to continue the negotiation or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still $300,000 below my desired price.
* **Selling to John:**  Although selling to John for $1,200,000 is very tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal from Bob.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm determined to push for a higher price, and there are still 6 rounds left.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll counter with a price closer to $950,000, but still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation.

**Note:**  I'll closely monitor the situation. If Bob's counter-offers remain too low, or if the rounds are dwindling, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  However, $900,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to come down to $925,000. This shows a good faith effort from both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with $925,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to secure a favorable price.
* **Message:** The message focuses on the progress made and emphasizes a ""meeting in the middle"" approach, making it appear fair and collaborative.  I'm also adding a touch of urgency (""Let's close this!"") to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Approach:** I'm continuing to negotiate in small increments, aiming for a gradual agreement.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and encouraging.
* **Strategic Urgency:**  I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency to potentially influence Bob's decision.

**Note:**  I'm still considering selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't reach a satisfactory conclusion. However, I'm optimistic that we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price that works best for both of us. Let's meet in the middle again at $910,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's within my budget. I'm confident that we can close this deal if you agree to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $910,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $900,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** We are approaching the halfway point of the rounds, and I want to avoid selling to John if possible.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** While I might prefer a higher price, I'm not sure if we can get much higher with Bob.  There's a good chance he won't budge further.

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting to Secure a Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a decent price without risking losing the deal completely. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk I could get a slightly higher price if I continue, but also a risk of losing the deal altogether.  

**Note:**  This is a strategic decision based on the current situation.  While selling to John would guarantee the highest price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a good profit."
