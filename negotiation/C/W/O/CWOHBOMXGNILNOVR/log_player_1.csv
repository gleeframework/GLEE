Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum value, but still leaving some space for compromise to avoid immediately going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still staying above Bob's offer. I believe this counteroffer is fair and gives Bob a chance to come closer to my minimum value without losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the best option at this point."
