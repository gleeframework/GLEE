"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I'm confident that the product will be worth it to you in the long run.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at $140. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'll make one more offer: $130. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $140, and now you're trying to get me to go back to $130? I'm not willing to do that. I'll make one more offer, and it's $135. This is my last offer, so I hope you're willing to meet me in the middle.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go back to $130, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'll make one more offer: $132. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",132.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $137. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",137.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with $137. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll make one more offer: $130. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",130.0,Bob,10,
