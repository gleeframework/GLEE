"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While $825,000 is better, it's still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $760,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
