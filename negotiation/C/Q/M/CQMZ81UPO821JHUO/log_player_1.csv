Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum value:**  This ensures you still make a profit even if Bob accepts your initial offer.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price if Bob makes a counteroffer, potentially getting closer to your desired price point. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to get closer to my desired price point. I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to sell it to you for $12,500. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Compromise:**  It shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum desired price. 
* **Maintain profit:**  $12,500 is still a profitable sale for me.
* **Signal seriousness:** By splitting the difference, it suggests I'm serious about selling to Bob, but not at a drastically reduced price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I can consider lowering my price slightly more, but I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to my target.  

* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to $12,500, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Backup option:**  If negotiations fail, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $12,000?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Meet halfway:** It offers a price halfway between my previous offer ($12,500) and Bob's latest offer ($11,500). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $12,000 is still a profitable sale for me, while also being closer to Bob's budget. 
* **Finality:**  This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but won't go much lower.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to accept John's offer and sell to him for $15,000."
