"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to sell it to you for $12500. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $12000?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
