Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob is now offering our minimum acceptable price. While we might be able to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting guarantees we get a good deal at $1,200,000, matching what John offers."
