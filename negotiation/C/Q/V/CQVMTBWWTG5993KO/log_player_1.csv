"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, knowing that the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially make a higher profit.  I'll keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm countering with $145. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $130. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135. While it's still not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer and is a good deal considering the possibility of selling to John for $120.  I'm also mindful of the limited rounds remaining and the potential for further negotiation breakdowns."
