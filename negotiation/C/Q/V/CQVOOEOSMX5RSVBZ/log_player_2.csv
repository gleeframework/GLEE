# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and the value it brings to me.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the benefits it offers you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above my desired price point.  However, it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be firm on this. I can't go any lower than $885,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the immense value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to my target price of $850,000. It's still within my budget and a good deal considering the product's potential value to me.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more.  Accepting her offer is the best option to secure the product at a fair price, and saves me from potentially having to pay John's higher price."
