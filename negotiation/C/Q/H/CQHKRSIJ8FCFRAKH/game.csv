"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not quite ready to commit at that price. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1,150,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. Let's try $1,100,000. This price is closer to what I can comfortably afford, and it still reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll come down to $1,175,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
