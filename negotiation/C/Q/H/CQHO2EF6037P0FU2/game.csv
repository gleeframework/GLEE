"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we discuss $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,000, Bob, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $15,000. How about we try $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  That's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll need to go with another seller.",13500.0,Bob,6,
