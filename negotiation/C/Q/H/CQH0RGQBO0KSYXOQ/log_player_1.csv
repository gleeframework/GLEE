"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
