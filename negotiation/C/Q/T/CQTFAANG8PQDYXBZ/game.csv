"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This offer reflects a serious commitment on my part to find a mutually agreeable price.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
