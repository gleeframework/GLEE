"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95  â€“ what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to Alice's value of $80 without risking the deal by lowballing.  We have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Opening:**  This counteroffer is a strong move. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, aiming to steer the negotiation closer to her $80 valuation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, we're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to our desired price range. This can influence Alice's subsequent counteroffers. 
* **Risk Management:** While a low offer, we still have plenty of rounds to negotiate. It's unlikely to offend Alice and provides room for both sides to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her valuation, but $85 is still above our target.  We've successfully anchored the negotiation lower, and there's room to negotiate further. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was a little optimistic. How about $78? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer, but keeping it significantly below her $85 counter.
* **Targeting the Zone of Agreement:** $78 is strategically placed just below her $80 valuation. It creates a strong incentive for Alice to accept, knowing we're getting close to her likely bottom line.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We still hold the option to walk away and go to John.  This underlying pressure encourages Alice to consider our offers seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I can do $82, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Alice has signaled that $82 is her final offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's risky. 
* **Significant Savings:** We've successfully negotiated the price down from $95 to $82, a saving of $13.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to an impasse. Accepting now secures the product at a favorable price, whereas delaying might force us to settle for John's $100 offer."
