"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  This is a great deal for both of us!  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120, saving you $30.
* **Alice's offer is likely the best you'll get.** While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
