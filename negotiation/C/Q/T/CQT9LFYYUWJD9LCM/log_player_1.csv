Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **John's Offer:**  John acts as your safety net, guaranteeing you $120 if Bob refuses.

Offering the product at $119 aims to extract the maximum potential profit from Bob. While it's a high price, it's still slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John. This gives Bob a small incentive to accept, as he'd be getting a slightly better deal than you accepting John's offer."
