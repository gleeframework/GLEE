{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message indicates openness to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation, while still securing a profit for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired profit margin. By rejecting the offer, you have the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your target. This strategy allows you to potentially secure a better deal with Bob or, if unsuccessful, fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $110.  This is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway, lowering your price from $115 to $110. 
* **Still profitable:**  $110 is still above your minimum of $100 and a good profit margin.
* **Positive framing:**  The message highlights the benefits for both parties, emphasizing a fair deal.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while giving you a better chance of reaching an agreement closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than your initial offer, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price of $100. You've already rejected two of his offers, and further negotiation might risk him walking away.

Here's why accepting the offer makes sense:

* **Profit:** $108 is a decent profit margin, considering your minimum was $100.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Even if you accept, there's a chance Bob might be willing to go a little higher if you express a slight hesitation.
* **Closing the deal:**  It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing the sale altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale and avoid the potential for further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a rejection."
