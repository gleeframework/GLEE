"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to me. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $110.  This is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.  Let's close this deal!",108.0,Bob,4,
