"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $1,400,000 is a reasonable starting point that allows for a few counteroffers before needing to consider selling to John.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still 9 rounds left. I can counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get a higher price if possible.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Continuing the Negotiation:** By offering a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation going and avoid selling to John yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below my desired range. 
* **More room for negotiation:** We've had 4 rounds, and there are 6 more rounds left. I believe there's potential to reach a higher price with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a price closer to my desired range. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle Again:** I'm again offering a compromise price, this time halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone, suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as we're getting closer to a deal and we only have 5 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge further, and I'm approaching my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to 4 rounds left.  There's a high chance of not reaching an agreement that's satisfactory to me.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  It's a safe and reliable option.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation failing is too high.  Selling to John is the most sensible choice at this point."
