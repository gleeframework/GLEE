``` 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for a good starting point for a potential counteroffer from Bob.  If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly to potentially reach an agreement before selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly below my desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,400,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above Bob's offer."

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  It's getting time-consuming, and I'm risking losing time and potentially the deal with John. I'm confident that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
