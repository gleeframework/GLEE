"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As the seller, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  To be honest though, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the product's value to me. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,000,000.  Cutting my losses and going with John guarantees I stay within my budget."
