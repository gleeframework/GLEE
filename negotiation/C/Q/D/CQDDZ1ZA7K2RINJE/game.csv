"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As the seller, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  To be honest though, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the product's value to me. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
