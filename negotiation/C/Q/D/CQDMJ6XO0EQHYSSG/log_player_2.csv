(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better price.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest and see how much room there is for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I have 7 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not in a rush to close the deal, and I'd rather risk a few more rounds than overpay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still a significant discount from her last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering I have 6 rounds remaining to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied.  I have 5 rounds left to negotiate and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to increase my offer, showing Alice my willingness to meet halfway.  At this point, we are only $50,000 apart. I believe this is a good compromise considering I have 4 rounds left to negotiate.  If Alice rejects this offer, I am willing to increase my offer again in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my desired price, and I have only 3 rounds left to negotiate. While I could try to get a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and running out of rounds is high. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a price that is still within my budget and allows me to avoid the risk of ending up with John's much higher price."
