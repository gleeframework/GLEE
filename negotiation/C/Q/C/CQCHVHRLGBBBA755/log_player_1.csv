"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, knowing it's worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my target. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of moving to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer, and hopefully, it'll be more appealing to him. I'm hoping that by demonstrating some flexibility, I can reach a mutually agreeable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $9,500. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of moving to the next round and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering Bob $10,500. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but I'm still holding firm on my desired price range.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and that a compromise is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's been 6 rounds, and Bob is not willing to meet my minimum expectations.  While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me a sale, and it's better than potentially losing the deal with Bob and ending up with nothing."
