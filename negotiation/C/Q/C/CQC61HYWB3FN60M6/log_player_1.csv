Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a bit above my minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,500. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and it's not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point."
