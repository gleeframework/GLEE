"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  A $1,200,000 offer is a significant saving from your maximum of $1,500,000. 
* **You have 10 rounds:**  There's ample time to try and get a better price without risking the deal falling through.
* **The goal is to save as much as possible:**  Even if you get a slightly better deal, it's worth trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? I'm confident this is a fair price given the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:**  Her counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still room for improvement:** $1,150,000 is a good price, but it's still above your ideal target.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 7 rounds left to try and push for a lower price.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the pressure on her to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,100,000.  This represents a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great value for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is nearing your target:**  She's now offering $1,080,000, which is significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **Potential for future negotiation is limited:**  You've already rejected a similar offer, and Alice might be less likely to come down further.
* **Time is running out:** You only have 5 rounds left. There's a risk that you might not be able to secure a better price within the remaining time.

While it would be ideal to get closer to $1,000,000, accepting the offer at $1,080,000 guarantees you a good deal and secures the product."
