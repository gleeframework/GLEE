"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000? I'm confident this is a fair price given the value I place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1100000.  This represents a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great value for you. What are your thoughts?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
