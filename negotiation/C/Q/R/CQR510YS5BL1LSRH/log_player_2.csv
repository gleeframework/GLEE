"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can reject it and still get the product at your maximum price point. There's no information to suggest Alice's offer is better than John's."
