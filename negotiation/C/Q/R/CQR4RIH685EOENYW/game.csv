"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in purchasing it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,750. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in purchasing it.",13750.0,Bob,4,
