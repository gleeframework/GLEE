{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while also ensuring that I profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a fair price, I'm not able to go that low. How about $100? That's a significant discount from my original price, and it still allows me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $100. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is a decent price, I'm running out of time and patience. Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is a guaranteed sale at $120, so I'll take the sure thing."
