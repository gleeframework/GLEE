"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
