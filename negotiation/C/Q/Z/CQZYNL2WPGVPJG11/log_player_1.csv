Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with my desired price, $150.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to entice Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I leave the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, but I've set the stage for a high initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $130 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:** I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting that $140 is still a good deal for Bob and a fair profit for me.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm inviting Bob to engage further and potentially agree on this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's offer is better:** John is willing to pay $150, which is a better deal for me than Bob's current offer.
* **No further negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a higher price that meets my minimum.

Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and minimizes the risk of further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
