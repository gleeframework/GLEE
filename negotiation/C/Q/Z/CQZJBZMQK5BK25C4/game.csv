"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is closer to the mark, but I'm still aiming for something a bit more manageable.  Would you consider $700,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",850000.0,Alice,5,
