Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high starting point. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm aiming to maximize my profits.  We'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. Bob's lowball offer indicates he's willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I want to show Bob I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to push for more,  I'm concerned about running out of rounds. Accepting his offer ensures I get a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
