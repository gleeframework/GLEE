Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $120, so I'm not taking a big risk.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium for it."
