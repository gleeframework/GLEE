Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go lower.  Accepting the $1,050,000 offer secures a reasonable deal for you.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, forcing you to buy from John at the much higher price."
