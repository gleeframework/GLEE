"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to say that I'm a bit surprised by the low price you're offering. Considering the product's value and the potential return on investment, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
