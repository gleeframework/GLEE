It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John."

I'm starting with my maximum price, hoping Alice might be willing to meet me in the middle."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is within my budget and significantly better than my initial counteroffer. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up buying from John at the same price."
