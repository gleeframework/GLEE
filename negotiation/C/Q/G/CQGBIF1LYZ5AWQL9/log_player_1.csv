{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise and keeps the door open for a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $87.50 as the price for the product. It's a bit closer to my budget while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $100, I'll take the safer route and sell to him."
