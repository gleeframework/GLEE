"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could buy the product from John for $15,000, Alice's offer of $14,000 saves you $1,000.  This is a better deal even though it's slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product."
