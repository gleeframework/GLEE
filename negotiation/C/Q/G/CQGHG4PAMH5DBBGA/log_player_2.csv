"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob needs to start with a price that's lower than Alice's offer but still within his budget. $125 is a good starting point.
* **Message:**  The message is polite and explains why Bob is counter-offering. It also shows that Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $135? It's still a great price for this product, and it's closer to your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $135 is still above Bob's ideal price of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob has a clear goal and the opportunity to continue negotiating.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open to a better deal."

Round 4

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual increase:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal.
* **Staying within budget:**  $130 is still within Bob's budget and closer to Alice's price. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, indicating a willingness to negotiate."
