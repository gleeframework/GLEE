"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, significantly less than what he'd pay John. 
* **Negotiation:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.  Further negotiation may take longer and doesn't guarantee a better price.  
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice getting firmer on her price or even walking away from the deal.  This would then force him to buy from John at a higher price."
