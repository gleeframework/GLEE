Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The open-ended question ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to respond and reveals how interested he is in the product. This gives you valuable information for the next step in the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $12,000 minimum since you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
