"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer takes into account your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
