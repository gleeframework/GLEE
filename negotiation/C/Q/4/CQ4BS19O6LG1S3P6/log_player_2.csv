"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent price, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. You have room to negotiate since the product is only worth $80 to Alice.  You'll save more money if you can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is closer to your ideal price, but you can still try to negotiate a little lower.  You're still willing to pay more than the product is worth to Alice, but you can aim for a price closer to your desired $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.75}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $91.25? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $91.25, which is still a good deal for you. It's closer to your desired price of $85 and significantly lower than John's offer of $100.  While you could continue negotiating, you're likely not going to get a significantly lower price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
