"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is above his budget. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he's still over by $4,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm at $13,000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. If you're not interested, I'm happy to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's final offer is $14,500, which is still over Bob's budget and not worth continuing to negotiate.  John's offer is the best option available to Bob, as it falls within his budget."
