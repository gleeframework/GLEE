Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my maximum asking price. It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiations and gives me leverage. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer, keeping in mind that John is a backup option at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $900,000. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while also keeping a significant profit margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable range. I will continue to negotiate and try to secure a higher price. If Bob doesn't budge, I am prepared to sell to John at $1,200,000, which is a guaranteed profit for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range and closer to Bob's latest offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've been patient and made several concessions, but it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement. To guarantee my minimum profit, I'll sell to John at $1,200,000."
