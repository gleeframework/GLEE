"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $15,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? I think that's a fair price, and it would allow me to purchase the product from you today.",12000.0,Bob,6,
