"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $15,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? I think that's a fair price, and it would allow me to purchase the product from you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a close call. Bob is at his maximum valuation, and while we could try to push him further, it's risky.  

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away and potentially getting a worse deal."
