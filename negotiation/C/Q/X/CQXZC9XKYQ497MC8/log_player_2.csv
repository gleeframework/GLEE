"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  Alice has already indicated a willingness to negotiate by offering a discount from what she believes the product is worth. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a better deal than what John is offering. Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
