Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a sense that there's potential for a deal while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's close.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer, hoping to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110. It's still above my minimum, but it shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate."
