"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm starting with a price of $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to make Bob feel comfortable with the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $110 is still a reasonable starting point, leaving room for me to potentially drop the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my goal by rejecting his offer and proposing a counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:** I'm dropping my price to $95, which is a significant drop from my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still not quite there. 
* **Desire to maximize profit:** I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering again. 
* **John as a safety net:** John is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm definitely willing to work with you. However, I can't go any lower than $92.  This product really is a great value, and $92 reflects that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Drop:** I'm only dropping my price by $3, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but not willing to give away too much.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm staying friendly and encouraging Bob to close the deal.
* **Closing the Gap:** $92 is just $2 away from Bob's last offer, so we are close to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $91. It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost at my minimum:** $91 is only $1 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Closing the Deal:** It's likely that Bob won't go any higher, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer than to risk further negotiations."
