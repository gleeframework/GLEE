"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Interested:** The message conveys our interest in the product while also making it clear we're looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Target in Mind:** While we'd ideally like to pay even less, aiming for around $60-$70 keeps us competitive while still leaving space for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $80. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our ideal price. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as we've reached the best possible outcome."
