Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
