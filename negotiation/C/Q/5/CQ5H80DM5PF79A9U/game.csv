"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. This product would need to be significantly less expensive for me to consider it.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could go up to $11,000, but that's really my limit.",11000.0,Bob,4,
