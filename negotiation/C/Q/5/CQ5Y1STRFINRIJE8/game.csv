"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",11500.0,Alice,3,
