Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000).

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit more assertive.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I'm confident this price represents a great investment on your end."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly below your guaranteed price but still leaves you with a substantial profit.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate, which strengthens your position.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Have a lower limit in mind (but not below $1,500,000) and be ready to walk away if needed.
* **Time Sensitivity (Optional):** You could subtly introduce a time limit to encourage a quicker decision from Bob. For example, you could mention you have other interested parties.
