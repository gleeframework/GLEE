"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,4,
