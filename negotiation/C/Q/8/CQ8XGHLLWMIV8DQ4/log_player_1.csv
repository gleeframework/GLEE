Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
