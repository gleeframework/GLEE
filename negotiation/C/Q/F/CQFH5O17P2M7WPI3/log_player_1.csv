Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a good profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's considerably more appealing to Bob than his perceived value of $8,000. This increases the likelihood of him accepting. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob could potentially counter-offer, and this price gives me a buffer to potentially negotiate slightly downward while still staying above my minimum."
