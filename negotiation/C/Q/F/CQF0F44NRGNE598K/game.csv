"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price you're proposing. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I'm getting closer to what might work, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
