"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This reflects its true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm looking to spend, but I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to save some money, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to find a way to make this work. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $825,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $800,000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept this price, I'll have to look at other options. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
