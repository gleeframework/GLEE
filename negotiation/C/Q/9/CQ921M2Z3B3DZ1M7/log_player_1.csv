"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle at $2,025,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $1,700,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more acceptable price, but we're not there yet. We still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal than $1,700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. How about $1,850,000? This reflects a significant movement from my initial ask, but still recognizes the true value of what I'm offering."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,850,000. How about we try $1,750,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting close, but it's still worth pushing a bit more. Bob is consistently moving up, suggesting he's willing to pay more than his initial offers. We have some rounds to spare and can try to close that $50,000 gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. What if we agree on $1,800,000? That's my final offer, and I think it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal that we're reaching the end of our negotiating.  We're holding firm at a price that's significantly higher than John's offer, and giving Bob a chance to close the deal at a price he's indicated he's comfortable with. This approach creates a sense of urgency and makes it clear we're aiming for a deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,800,000. How about we try $1,775,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While we were aiming for $1,800,000, Bob is consistently showing a willingness to negotiate upwards. Accepting his $1,775,000 offer secures a significant profit above John's standing offer, and there's no guarantee we can extract more from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's a good deal at this point."
