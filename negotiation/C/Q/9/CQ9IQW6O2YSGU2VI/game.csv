"I understand that $12000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11000. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you at $10800. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
