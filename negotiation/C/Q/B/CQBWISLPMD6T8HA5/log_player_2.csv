"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always best to start by trying to negotiate a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I see the value in the product, I'm not quite ready to go that high just yet.  How about $8,500?  That would be a good starting point for us to explore a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8800. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8800 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $8700?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would let us finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8700. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $8900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $8,900, which is within your budget and a better price than what John is offering.  It's a good deal for you, and you're saving $1,100 compared to John's price."
