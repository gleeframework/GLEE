"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I see the value in the product, I'm not quite ready to go that high just yet.  How about $8500?  That would be a good starting point for us to explore a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8800. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8800 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $8700?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would let us finalize this deal.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8700. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $8900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
