I'm starting with a price slightly below what I'd sell it to John for, hoping to entice Bob while still getting a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

I'm offering a price that's still lower than what I'd sell it to John for, but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to lower my price a bit more, but I'm not going any lower. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in this product and accepts my offer."

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offers are still too low for me, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
