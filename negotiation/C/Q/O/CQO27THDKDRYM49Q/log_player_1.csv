Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but less than what it's worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good starting point.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down, but if he's not, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I can still sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and at this point, I'm not sure how much more he's willing to pay.  It's not worth risking losing a sale to John for a few extra dollars."
