"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
