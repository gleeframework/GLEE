"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $9,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,,
