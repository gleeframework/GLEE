Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The message doesn't explicitly mention John, maintaining a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 

This strategy balances securing a strong profit with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
