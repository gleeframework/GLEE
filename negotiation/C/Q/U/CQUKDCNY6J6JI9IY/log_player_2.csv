"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than our actual maximum price ($120) to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's willingness to come down.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses interest while clearly stating the offer is too high. This encourages continued negotiation.
* **Targeting Below John's Price:**  By aiming for $100, we're trying to secure a price better than John's $120 offer, maximizing our potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still above our $120 maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice moving from $180 to $140 indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's a chance of getting closer to our target.
* **John as Backup:**  We still have the option to buy from John at $120 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $140 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  We're splitting the difference between Alice's offer ($140) and our previous counter ($100) to show movement and find a compromise.
* **Below Budget, Above John:** $115 puts us below our maximum budget while still offering a price potentially attractive to Alice (and better than John's $120).
* **Positive Language:** We continue to use positive phrasing (""appreciate"", ""closer"") to encourage a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $130. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great price for this amazing product. I'm willing to make a deal at $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice is getting closer at $130, but it's still above our budget and only slightly better than John's offer.
* **Final Push:** We have a few rounds left to try and nudge Alice down further. A firm but polite counter might secure us a better deal. 
* **John Remains an Option:**  We can always fall back on buying from John for $120 if Alice doesn't budge from $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  To be honest, $120 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're open to it."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at our maximum budget, so this is our last attempt to get a better deal from Alice.
* **Firm but Respectful:**  The message is direct about our budget limit while maintaining a polite and appreciative tone.
* **Decision Point for Alice:** This offer forces Alice to decide if she'd rather make a slightly smaller profit or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has made it clear that $125 is her lowest price.
* **Above Budget:** $125 is still $5 above our maximum budget.
* **John's Guarantee:** John offers a guaranteed price of $120, which is within our budget.

It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and we're not willing to go over budget.  Buying from John ensures we get the product at the best possible price for us."
