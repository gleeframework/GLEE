"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $120, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant reduction in the price, leaving room for potential compromise. It's aggressive but not unreasonable, given your $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still above your ideal price point, but closer. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to continue haggling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's price while still staying within your budget. It shows you're serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $135 is closer to your goal, it's still a bit high. With five rounds left, there's time to keep trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

This offer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Alice's $135 and your $110 offer. It shows a commitment to finding a middle ground and signals you're ready to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

With only three rounds left, the negotiation isn't going in your favor. Alice is firm on her price, and you're unlikely to get a lower price from her.  John offers a guaranteed price, and it's the best way to ensure you get the product within your budget."
