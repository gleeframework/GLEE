"Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $950000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still gives you a substantial margin on the product's true value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer.  However, $1050000 is still a bit too far from what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal in the next round.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
