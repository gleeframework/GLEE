Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still ensures I get a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'm also happy to sell to John for $8,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value.  Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum I need, and avoids further negotiation."
