"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
