Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to in the future."
