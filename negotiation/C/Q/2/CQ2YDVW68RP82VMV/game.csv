"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects a compromise while still allowing me to achieve my desired outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  While $1300000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value of the product.  To demonstrate my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1325000.  Let's see if we can finalize this negotiation and make this a win-win situation.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
