"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,600 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $8,000.  I'm hoping to leverage the fact that Alice has a higher valuation for the product, and she might be willing to compromise to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only slightly lowered her price from the previous round. While it's tempting to accept because it's closer to my maximum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. There are still 7 rounds left, so I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still staying below my maximum. I want to show Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to overpay. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to her, considering she's already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's only $100 lower than her previous offer, which shows she's not willing to budge much. With 5 rounds left, I'm still hoping to get a better deal, especially since I can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it below my maximum. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Alice has already lowered her price twice. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to overpay. With 4 rounds remaining, I'm hoping to close the deal with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum. It's clear that we're not going to find a price that works for both of us. With only three rounds left, the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high. I'm better off buying the product from John at a guaranteed price of $8,000."
