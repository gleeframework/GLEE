Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong offer to showcase the product's worth and set a high bar for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I believe I can get a better price, but with only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my offer to $825,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us to reach a final agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I'm only willing to accept a price above my minimum of $800,000. With only four rounds left, I need to make a strategic decision. I'll counteroffer again, but this time I'll be more aggressive, aiming to push Bob closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is a final offer, as I'm running out of time. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
