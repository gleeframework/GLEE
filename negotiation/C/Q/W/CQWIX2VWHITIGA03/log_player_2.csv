"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for me. This product is not just an item; it's a symbol of excellence and innovation. I believe its true worth surpasses $1500000, but I am willing to consider your perspective on its value.

To make this offer more appealing, I am proposing a flexible negotiation process where we can discuss the price based on your assessment of the product's significance to you. My initial offer is set at $1800000. If this price aligns with your expectations, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction.

Should you require any additional information or have questions about the product, feel free to ask. I am here to ensure you have all the details necessary to make an informed decision.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Alice

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The price of $1,800,000 is too high for me, and I'd like to explore other options. I'll look into buying the product from John for $800,000.
