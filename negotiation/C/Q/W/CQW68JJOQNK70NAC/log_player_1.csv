Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price to John, she starts high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification for the Price:**  The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high. This allows Bob to counter-offer without feeling like Alice is being unreasonable. 
* **Confidence and Urgency:** The language is framed to convey value and encourage a quick decision from Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:**  This response assumes Alice has limited information about the market for this product. If she knew more about typical profit margins or Bob's financial situation, she could tailor her approach.
* **Negotiation:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared for Bob to negotiate, and she'll need to decide how much she's willing to lower the price to secure the deal."
