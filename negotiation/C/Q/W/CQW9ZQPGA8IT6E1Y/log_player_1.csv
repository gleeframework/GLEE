Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer aims to secure the highest possible profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation above your minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to your desired range. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
