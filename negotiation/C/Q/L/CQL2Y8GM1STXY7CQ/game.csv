"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $9,500 is a little higher than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $9,000. How about we try $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $9,100 is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",9100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $9,250 and $9,100. How about we try $9,175?",9175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,175 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle of our last two offers at $9,137.50.  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",9137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $9,175 and $9,137.50. How about we try $9,156.25?",9156.25,Alice,7,
