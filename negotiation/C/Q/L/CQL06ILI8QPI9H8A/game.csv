"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable, but I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still staying within a reasonable price range.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to get closer to my target price. My next counteroffer is $1,200,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
