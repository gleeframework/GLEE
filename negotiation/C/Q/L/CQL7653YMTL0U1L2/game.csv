"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
