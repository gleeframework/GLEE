"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $3,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating further.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's not the best possible deal, and Bob has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000, but also wants to ensure a deal happens. $10,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than buying from John, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's a good chance Alice will compromise further to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing that he's willing to negotiate but still wants a good price. $11,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. This demonstrates his commitment to getting a deal, while still keeping the price lower than his maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and  a good compromise considering the negotiation so far. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing interest in the product.  It's a good time for Bob to secure the product at a decent price."
