"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10250?",9250.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're a serious buyer, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $11500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10800. This is a bit closer to my original target, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $11200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $10800. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at this price. Please let me know if this is something we can agree on.",10800.0,Bob,6,
