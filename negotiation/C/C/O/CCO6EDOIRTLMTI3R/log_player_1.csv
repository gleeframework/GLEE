Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good compromise between my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone (""amazing"", ""very interested"") can help create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffer:** The message leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close to my target), reject it (if it's too low) or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If the negotiation with Bob stalls, I'll move on to John to secure my minimum desired price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but I was hoping to negotiate a price closer to $8,000. I appreciate your time and consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me a safety net and strengthens my negotiating position with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target of $12,000 while still considering Bob's willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The offer of $9,500 is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message provides justification for the price, highlighting the discount from my initial offer and emphasizing the ""fair profit"" aspect.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've secured a good deal, getting closer to my target price.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* If negotiation stalls, I'll move on to John and sell for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? I am looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum target of $12,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob is sticking to his budget of $8,000, and it seems unlikely he will budge much further. This signals that the negotiation may be nearing a stalemate.
* **John's offer is a guarantee:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who is unlikely to meet my minimum.

**Next Step:**  I will choose to sell the product to John for $12,000, as it guarantees me a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'd love to work with you, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my previous offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a final compromise, offering a significant discount from my previous offer, but still remaining above Bob's budget.
* **Setting a Limit:**  The message emphasizes this is the ""absolute lowest"" I'm willing to go, leaving no room for further negotiation.
* **Creating Urgency:** The message hints at exploring other options, subtly creating urgency for Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a decent deal closer to my target, even if it's not ideal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll move on to John and sell for $12,000, ending the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $9,000, but I'm still not able to meet that price. I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for you to consider this request? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum target of $12,000 and shows minimal movement from his previous offers. It seems unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  The negotiation has reached a point where further rounds are unlikely to yield a significantly better price for me. 
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $12,000, ensuring a much more profitable outcome.  

**Next Step:**  I'll stop negotiating with Bob and move forward with the sale to John.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob for a slightly higher price is too high, given the guarantee of a successful transaction with John."
