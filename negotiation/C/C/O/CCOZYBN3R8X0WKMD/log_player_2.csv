"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value for the product ($800,000). There's room for negotiation to save more money.  It's worth trying to counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but still a fair price that allows Alice to profit. This gives Alice an incentive to accept, while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant step down from her initial offer and is only $50,000 higher than my counteroffer.  It's a good deal for me considering I can still save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or the deal falling through is high."
