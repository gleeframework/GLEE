Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum price of $800,000.  This also leaves room for Bob to make a counter-offer if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to earn a significant profit."
