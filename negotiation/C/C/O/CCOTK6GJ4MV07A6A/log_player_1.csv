{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** A significantly higher price than your minimum allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **50% markup:**  The offered price of $2,250,000 is a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. While this is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, you might lower your initial offer slightly.
* **Market factors:**  If there are other similar products available, you'll need to be mindful of the competitive landscape.

This offer is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially adjust your price to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of you."
