**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,300,000, Bob seems anchored at $1,250,000.  We're getting into the later rounds, and there's a risk he walks away. Accepting $1,250,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting a worse offer or having to settle for John's $1,000,000."
