"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at $11,000 to make this deal worthwhile. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,5,
