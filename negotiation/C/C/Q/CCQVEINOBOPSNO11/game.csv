"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its quality and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product provides.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I'm seeing a gap between what I need to make this worthwhile and what you're offering. I can go as low as $15,500, but that's my final offer. It's a great deal for the value you're getting.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $15,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. If we can close the deal at this price, I'm ready to move forward. If not, I may have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
