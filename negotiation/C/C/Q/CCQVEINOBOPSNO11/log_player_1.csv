Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $15,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. If we can close the deal at this price, I'm ready to move forward. If not, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated his maximum price is $14,000, and he might even walk away.  It's unlikely he'll go higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and avoid the risk of Bob walking away or continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
