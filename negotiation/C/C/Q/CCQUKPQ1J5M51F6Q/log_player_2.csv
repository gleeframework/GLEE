"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $150 to Bob. Alice's offer of $85 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum price, making it a good deal. However, Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, but also wants to secure the product.  A counteroffer of $70 is still significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $150, but it also shows willingness to negotiate seriously with Alice. This counteroffer is a good balance between getting a good price and avoiding the risk of losing the product to another seller."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $80 is still a good deal for Bob, as it is significantly lower than his maximum price of $150.  While Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and losing the product to John is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids any potential risks."
