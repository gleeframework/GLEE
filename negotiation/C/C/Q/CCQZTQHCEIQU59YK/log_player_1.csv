"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to establish a starting point for negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $1,750,000 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Counteroffers:** I have 10 rounds, and there's still a chance to negotiate with Bob and reach a more favorable price. 
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to pursue a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within Range:**  $1,600,000 is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" he's getting.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  Leaving some room for further negotiation keeps the door open for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,300,000 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time for a Firm Stance:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to start demonstrating a firmer stance. 
* **Exploring further options:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to explore further negotiation with Bob or consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a strong offer for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Last Chance for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, but making it clear that this is a serious offer. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** The offer is still above my minimum price, but it adds pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. 
* **No Progress:** Bob's offer remains far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Lower Offers:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further price reductions, potentially leaving me with a deal less favorable than selling to John. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirement and ensures a successful transaction.

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of a lower offer outweighs the potential benefits at this stage. Selling to John offers a secure outcome and allows me to move on without further delays or potential losses."
