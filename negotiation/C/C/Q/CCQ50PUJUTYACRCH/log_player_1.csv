"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if you lower the price later. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product. This is intentional to gauge how much he's willing to budge and to establish the upper end of the bargaining range. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  While the offer is high, it's still below John's guaranteed offer.  This ensures that even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his perceived value, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price. Alice knows there's potential for a better deal. She'll counter-offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's unique features and market potential make it worth a premium. Could you consider $1,350,000?"" , 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  Alice acknowledges Bob's offer and moves down from her initial price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Justify the Price:** She reinforces the product's value to support the higher price tag, aiming to shift Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The counter-offer is a significant drop from the first offer but still comfortably above both Bob's offer and Alice's minimum.  This leaves room for further negotiation while pushing towards a more favorable outcome for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Can we discuss $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's desired range, but $1,250,000 is still below her minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** Alice knows Bob is interested, and with 6 rounds remaining, there's time for further negotiation.  
* **John as Backup:** The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 gives Alice a safety net, allowing her to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to ensure this is a fair deal. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the true value of what you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  Alice makes a smaller price reduction this time, signaling she's reaching her limit and emphasizing the fairness of the new price.
* **Final Offer Tone:**  The message hints that this is a strong offer without explicitly stating it's a final offer, leaving some room for adjustment if needed.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:**  Alice consistently reiterates the product's value throughout the negotiation, aiming to justify the price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Can we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Acceptable:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to Alice's minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  With the negotiation extending past the halfway point, it's becoming increasingly advantageous to secure the deal and avoid further time investment."
