Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $800000 at this time. I believe this price reflects the value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need a higher starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. To move forward, I'd need a price closer to $1,400,000. This price still leaves room for a good deal for you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's work towards an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This price gives you a good deal and gets me closer to my target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still at my limit of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our continued negotiations.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob has been stubborn and hasn't budged much from his initial offer, and I'm not confident we'll reach a satisfactory price in the remaining rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,200,000."
