Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is simply too low for me. To move forward, I'd need a price closer to $1400000. This price still leaves room for a good deal for you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
