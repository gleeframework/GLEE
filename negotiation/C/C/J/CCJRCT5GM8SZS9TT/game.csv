"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $800000 at this time. I believe this price reflects the value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is simply too low for me. To move forward, I'd need a price closer to $1400000. This price still leaves room for a good deal for you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's work towards an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1100000 for the product. This price gives you a good deal and gets me closer to my target.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still at my limit of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our continued negotiations.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
