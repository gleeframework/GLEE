Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $700,000 is too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price still gives you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve my target.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value this product offers to your business.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward together.
