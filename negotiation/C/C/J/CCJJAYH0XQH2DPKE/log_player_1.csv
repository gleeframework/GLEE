{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $950,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $700,000 is too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price still gives you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve my target."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $750,000 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to accept a loss on this product.  I'm going to see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value this product offers to your business.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward together."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $775,000.  That's a substantial increase on my end and shows I'm serious about getting this deal done.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
