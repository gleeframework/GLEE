"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $950,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $700,000 is too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price still gives you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve my target.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value this product offers to your business.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward together.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $775,000.  That's a substantial increase on my end and shows I'm serious about getting this deal done.",775000.0,Bob,6,
