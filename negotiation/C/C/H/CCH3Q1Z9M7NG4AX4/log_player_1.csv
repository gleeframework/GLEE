Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the product's value to Bob. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and flexibility in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the option to sell to John for $800,000 provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is tempting, it's significantly lower than both my initial asking price and his perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a price closer to the product's true worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price range.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly reminding Bob why he was willing to pay a higher price in the first place. 
* **Maintaining Strength:** The counteroffer of $850,000 is still significantly higher than the minimum selling price to John, keeping a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $775,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a smart financial decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $775,000 is his highest offer. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his offer would net $25,000 more than selling to John.  However, there's a risk that Bob could walk away entirely if pushed further.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale at a price above my minimum acceptable threshold. It eliminates the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
