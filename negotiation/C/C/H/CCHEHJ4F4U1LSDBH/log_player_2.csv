"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. I can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to try and gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation while staying well below my $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is too low for me. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still above my maximum budget. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice. How about we settle for $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to my maximum budget, but leaving some room for negotiation.  This price point is also a fair compromise between our two initial offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $127? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $127. It's clear we won't reach an agreement within my $120 budget. John offers a guaranteed price that saves me money, so it's time to take that option."
