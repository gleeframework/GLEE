Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and I'm not willing to go higher.

You have three options:

Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
