"Alice,  $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price, and I'm not willing to go higher.",850000.0,Bob,4,
