Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum, and I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,012,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $990,000. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit, and $990,000 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $990,000, which would be $1,020,000.

Alice is very stubbornly sticking to her tactic of meeting in the middle, and it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal in the last round. Accepting her offer at $1,012,500 is a reasonable compromise."
