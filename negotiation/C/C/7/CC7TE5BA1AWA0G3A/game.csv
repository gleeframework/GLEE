"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I do like the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $975,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it would be a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum, and I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,012,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell you're serious about finding a fair price. To show you I'm serious too, I'm willing to come up to $990,000.  That's a big jump from my last offer, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $990,000. I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to make a profit, and $990,000 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $990,000, which would be $1,020,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I respect that. Let's split the difference again and settle this at $1,005,000.  This brings us very close to a deal, and it saves both of us time and effort haggling over smaller amounts.",1005000.0,Bob,8,
