Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is higher than $1,000,000, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's lower than your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a potential win-win situation.

This strategy aims to get Bob engaged in the negotiation without immediately scaring him away with a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also considerably lower than the initial offer I made.  Selling to Bob at this price would result in a significant loss.  

Instead, I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain a good profit margin:** $950,000 is still above my minimum price and provides a reasonable profit.
* **Test the waters:** This price point allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will prompt Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is a bit closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.  

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still allows for some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $875,000 is still too far off from what I need.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. How about $912,500? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both come closer to our desired prices.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 912500} 
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show continued willingness to negotiate:** I'm still working with Bob to find a solution.
* **Stay above my minimum:** $912,500 is still above my minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **Be a reasonable compromise:** This price is halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $875,000.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.  If he rejects again, I might have to seriously consider selling to John."
