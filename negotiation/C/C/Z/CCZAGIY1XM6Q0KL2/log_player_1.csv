{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, we know he's interested. A flat rejection might mean we need to adjust our approach.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob."
