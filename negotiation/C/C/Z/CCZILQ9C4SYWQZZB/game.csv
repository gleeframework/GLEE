"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?  This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
