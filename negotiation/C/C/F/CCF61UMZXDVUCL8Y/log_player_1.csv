{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $150,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate, as he values the product at $1,000,000.
* **It shows you're serious:** A high initial offer demonstrates confidence in your product and your ability to negotiate.

Remember, the key is to be flexible and adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses."

# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. How about we aim for $850,000? I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to push for a higher price and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation, I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. How about considering $875,000 for the product? I'm hoping this might open up a path towards a successful transaction for both of us.

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's room for negotiation.  While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I want to see if we can get closer to my desired price of $900,000."
