Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $150 allows for potential profit while leaving space for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Gauge interest:**  The message aims to pique Bob's interest by highlighting the product's value specifically to him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not overly aggressive, suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further if Bob hesitates. 
 
This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a price closer to your ideal while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
