Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $120, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($119) leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down slightly, you could still get a better price than John's offer.
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message uses positive language (""special price"", ""great deal"") to entice Bob without revealing your minimum price.

This approach balances risk and reward by aiming for the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
