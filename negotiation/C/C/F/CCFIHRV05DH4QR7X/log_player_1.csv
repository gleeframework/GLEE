Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 price:** This is a reasonable starting point, offering Bob a slight discount while still ensuring you earn a significant profit. 
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum price. 
* This encourages Bob to negotiate and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable price.
* I'm prepared to counter his offers, but if they get too low or negotiations drag on, I'll sell to John for my minimum price to ensure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can squeeze a better deal out of him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great deal for you, considering what the product is worth. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $100 to $95, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but not willing to accept a price that's too low.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $95 is a good deal considering his perceived value.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is still lower than my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. Considering the potential for a longer negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away completely, accepting his offer at $90 is the best option. This ensures a sale and a decent profit."
