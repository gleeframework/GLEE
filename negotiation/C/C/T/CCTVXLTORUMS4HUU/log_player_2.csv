"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and leaves a lot of room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if a lower price can be reached."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to push for a lower price, and if I'm unsuccessful, I can still purchase the product from John for $1,500,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000, which would be $887,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $887,500 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and close to my last counteroffer. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that further negotiations would be time-consuming and potentially result in a higher price if she makes another counteroffer. 

Given the risk of losing the deal or having to pay the higher price from John, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
