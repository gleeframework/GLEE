"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's worth $10,000 to you, but she's offering it for $9,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** There are 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.** If you can't get a lower price from Alice, you can always go with John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your range.**  You want to save as much money as possible, but also want to make a reasonable offer that Alice might accept.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate.** This counteroffer shows that you are willing to negotiate, but also that you're serious about buying the product. 
* **Leaves room for compromise.** You're leaving space for Alice to counter with a price closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.**  She's come down to $8,800, which is only $300 more than your initial counteroffer.
* **It's a good deal.** You're getting the product for $2,000 less than its value to you.
* **There's a risk of going higher.**  While you might be able to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject further offers, and you'll be stuck buying from John at $10,000. 

**It's a good time to accept this offer and secure a favorable price.**"
