"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $120 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120. It's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to come to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finally seal the deal.",125.0,Alice,7,
