{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. I'm also being polite and suggesting a compromise to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $65 is too low.  How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired earnings.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going with a final counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and highlighting the value of the product to make it more appealing."
