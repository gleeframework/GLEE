"Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and still allows you to make a profit. Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit and reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $920,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to make a profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $890,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $915,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can close the deal.",915000.0,Alice,9,
