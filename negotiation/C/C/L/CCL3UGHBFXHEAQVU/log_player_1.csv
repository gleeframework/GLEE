Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, potentially getting me closer to $115.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell it to John for my minimum price."
