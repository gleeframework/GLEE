"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how many rounds are left.  If he rejects, I'll lower the price, but not too drastically. I want to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $900,000, but still aiming for a substantial profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining my expectation of a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll further adjust my price in the next round, taking into account the remaining time and his potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum,  I'm running out of time. It's better to secure a deal now rather than risk a lower offer in the next round or having to sell to John for $800,000."
