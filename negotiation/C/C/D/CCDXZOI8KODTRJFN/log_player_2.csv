"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and try to secure a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and allows for a profitable margin for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This price still reflects a significant profit for me, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still within your budget and represents a good compromise. Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's risky.  There's a chance that Alice might not budge further, and you could end up paying the full $1,000,000 to John.  Accepting the offer ensures you acquire the product while still saving some money."
