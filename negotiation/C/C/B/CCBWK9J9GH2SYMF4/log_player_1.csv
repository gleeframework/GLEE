I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair offer, given the value of the product to me."

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum.  It's more profitable than selling to John, so I'll accept it."
