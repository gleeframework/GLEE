,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to take $140 for it?  It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $155 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $150?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
