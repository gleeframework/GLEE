"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece that I believe would be a great asset to you. While I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, I'd like to give you the first shot at this deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you have a better option. You know John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is significantly less than Alice's $1,400,000 asking price.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that."
