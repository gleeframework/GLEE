,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm encouraged by your interest, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. Given your original price and my initial counteroffer, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is a reasonable compromise. This allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
