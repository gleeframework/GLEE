"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
