Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high, but I still think the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll sell the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $10,200 saves $1,800 compared to John's offer, making it a good deal."
