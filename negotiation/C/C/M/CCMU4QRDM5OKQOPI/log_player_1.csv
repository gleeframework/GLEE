Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can use that time to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I'm still confident this is a good deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This still keeps my expenses within my desired budget while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and within a reasonable range of my initial offer. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and saves time for further negotiation."
