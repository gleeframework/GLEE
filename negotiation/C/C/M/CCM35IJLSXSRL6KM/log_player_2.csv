"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a great price, but there's always the potential to get it even lower. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a negotiation and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting the negotiation by making a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a common tactic to set the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.  The counteroffer of $700,000 is still within Bob's budget, but leaves room for Alice to potentially make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  While Bob initially aimed for $700,000,  $850,000 is still a substantial saving compared to the $1,500,000 price from John. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking a further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the negotiation."
