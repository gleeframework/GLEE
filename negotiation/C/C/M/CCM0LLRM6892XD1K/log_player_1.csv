**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (because John acts as a guaranteed backup).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.

**Strategy**

1. **Start High:**  Begin with an offer above Bob's perceived value to give yourself room to negotiate.
2. **Provide Justification:** Don't just throw out a number;  subtly highlight the product's value to justify the price.

**The Offer**

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair and reflects its true value. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 gives you room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's benefits, justifying the price. 
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Be ready to adjust your price, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **John is your Safety Net:** Knowing you have John as a backup gives you leverage in the negotiation."
