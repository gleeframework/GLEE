I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob, as it's likely he wouldn't know the true value of the product and could be willing to pay more than my minimum price of $12,000. 

If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $12,000, guaranteeing a profit. This strategy balances risk and reward, allowing me to maximize potential earnings while ensuring a fallback option."
