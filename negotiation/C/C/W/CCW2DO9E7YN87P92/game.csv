"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $12500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $20000. How about we meet in the middle at $17500?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but $17500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $21000. What do you think?",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $21000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18500. Can we meet at this price?",18500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not there yet. I'll make one more compromise - I'll meet you at $20000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $19250. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",19250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer, Bob. I'm at my minimum price of $20000, and I'm not budging. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What's your next move?",20000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $19000. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",19000.0,Bob,10,
