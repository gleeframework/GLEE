"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1800000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table.
