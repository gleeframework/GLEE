Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the investment for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This shows you're willing to negotiate and creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer. 

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response.  If he rejects, you'll need to consider whether to lower your price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a decision quickly. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but I'm still willing to negotiate.  I believe I can secure a higher price by counteroffering.  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to move quickly.  I'm not quite ready to accept $13,500, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This represents a significant discount for you and is still a fair price for me. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is still above Bob's value:**  This maintains a margin of profit for me.
* **Counteroffer is close to his offer:**  It shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Reiterating the value:**  I'm highlighting the discount Bob is receiving to incentivize him further.

This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court, and it creates pressure for him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would be happy to finalize the deal at this price. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,750 is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given the back-and-forth negotiation, it's likely that further rounds won't result in a significantly higher offer from Bob.  It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale rather than risk losing him altogether and having to sell to John at a lower price."
