"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, the offer of $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, recognizing its potential value. This offer reflects a fair price that aligns with my financial capabilities and the market value of similar products. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To accommodate your needs while still reflecting the value of our product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This price is reflective of the product's quality and potential value, while also being more accessible within your current financial framework. I hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to reach that price point. I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This is a fair price for the product considering its current market value and the benefits it provides. Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",800000.0,Bob,4,
