"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that price point be workable for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,125,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000.
