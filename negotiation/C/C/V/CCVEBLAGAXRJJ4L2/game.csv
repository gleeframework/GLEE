"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is great, the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to my target price! However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
