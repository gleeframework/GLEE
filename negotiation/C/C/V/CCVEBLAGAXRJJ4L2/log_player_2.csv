Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to my target price! However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. She's already made it clear that $10,250 is her ""final compromise"". It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk Alice sticking to her price or the negotiation dragging on."
