"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a lower price.  I'm keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While $800,000 is not a terrible offer, I'm going to reject it and attempt to get closer to my desired price. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $1,100,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my minimum value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is only $50,000 above John's offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll probably end up selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly equal to John's offer.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, there's no guarantee he'll accept a counteroffer, and I only have two rounds left.  It's not worth the risk of losing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. I'll sell to John."
