Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to work with me, Alice, but $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $130.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised at $137.50 and now you're asking me to go back to $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $137.50 and $130, so I'll offer it to you for $133.75

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is offering $133.75, which is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Since we're nearing the middle, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price, I'll accept this offer."
