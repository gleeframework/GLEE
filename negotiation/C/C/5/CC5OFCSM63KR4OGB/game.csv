"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my needs, but $14,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to do $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $11,500?  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows for both of us to walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,5,
