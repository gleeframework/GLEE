**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  Even though she's made some concessions, I'm not comfortable going any higher.  It's better for me to buy from John at $10,000 and avoid any further negotiations."
