Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($100) but below what it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $100, but it's closer than my first offer.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair price that gives you a good margin and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's higher than what John is offering and is close enough to my minimum price to make it worth accepting.  Further negotiation might get me a better price, but it's not worth the risk of losing a sale entirely."
