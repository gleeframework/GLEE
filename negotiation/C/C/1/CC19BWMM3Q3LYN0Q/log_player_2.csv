The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110.  This is more than you are willing to pay. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.

While $95 is closer to your ideal price, it's still more than you're willing to spend. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
