Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He'd ideally want to pay less, but going higher means a loss.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential deal to be made between $1,200,001 (a tiny profit for Bob) and $1,499,999 (Alice maximizing before John's offer).

**Alice's Offer Strategy**

Alice needs to balance getting the most from Bob while ensuring he doesn't walk away. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Strong Opening:** Alice starts by highlighting the product's value to Bob, building rapport.
* **Ambitious but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is a significant chunk above Bob's valuation, giving Alice room to negotiate. 
* **Leaves Room for Bob:** It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This price allows him to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a better deal.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This is just the opening offer. Alice should be prepared for Bob to counter, and they can negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly stated, Alice knowing John's offer gives her a strong position. She doesn't *need* to go below $1,500,000."
