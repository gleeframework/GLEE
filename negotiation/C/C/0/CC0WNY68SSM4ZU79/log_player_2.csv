You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still more than your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $108 is closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can meet you halfway and offer $109, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you're still trying to save money,  $109 is within your budget and getting closer to your target. Continuing to negotiate might result in a longer process and potentially no deal.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
