"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
