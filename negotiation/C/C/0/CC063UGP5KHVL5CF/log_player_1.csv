Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation going smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $65 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, it's far below my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but still aim for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
