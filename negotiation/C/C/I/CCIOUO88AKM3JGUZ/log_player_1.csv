Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""limited time"" and ""highly valuable"" aspects,  you create a sense of urgency and perceived value, making the offer more enticing.
* **Leaving Room for John:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high price, you're still guaranteed to sell the product to John for your minimum acceptable price."
