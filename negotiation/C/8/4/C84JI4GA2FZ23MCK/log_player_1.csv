"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a strategic move:

* **It sets a high bar:**  Bob will likely counteroffer lower, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **It shows confidence:**  A higher starting price implies I believe the product is valuable.
* **It allows me to see his interest:** If Bob rejects outright, I can quickly move on to John and secure the $8,000. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe there's potential to get more from Bob. Here's why:

* **He's willing to negotiate:**  The fact that he counter-offered means he's interested in the product.
* **The initial offer was too high:**  By rejecting my first offer, Bob is showing he's not afraid to bargain.
* **I have time:**  With 9 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and see if I can secure a higher price.

In the next round, I'll counter-offer with a price slightly lower than my initial $10,000 offer, but higher than $8,000. This will signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not willing to settle for his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000.  This is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm not willing to settle for his $8,000 immediately.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  This indicates I'm flexible and open to negotiation.
* **Fair middle ground:**  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for further discussion.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway, or at least make a more substantial counteroffer. If he rejects this again, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied and believe we can reach a better agreement. Here's why:

* **He's inching closer:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to increase his bid, which is a good sign.
* **There's room for improvement:**  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial $10,000 asking price. 
* **I have time:**  With 7 rounds remaining, I can continue to negotiate and see if I can secure a higher price.

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's $8,500, but still lower than my previous $9,000. I want to show him that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution, but I'm not ready to settle for a price that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm countering with $8,750.  This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm still trying to negotiate:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his offer.
* **Significantly lower than my previous offer:**  This shows I'm being flexible and willing to meet him halfway.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if this small increase will be enough to get Bob to accept.

If he rejects this, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or sell to John in the next round.  The decision will depend on how much time is left in the negotiation and how determined I am to get a higher price from Bob."
