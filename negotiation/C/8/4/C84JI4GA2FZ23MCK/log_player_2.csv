"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's serious intent to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay right now.  There are still rounds left, and Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, he's still below Alice's latest offer, demonstrating that he's serious about getting a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While Bob still wants to save even more, he's getting close to his target price of $8,000 and needs to consider the risk of further negotiation. If he rejects, Alice might counter with a higher price, or the negotiations could drag on. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, as it guarantees a purchase at a price that's within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
