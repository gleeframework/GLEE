Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate further without risking a deal with John."
