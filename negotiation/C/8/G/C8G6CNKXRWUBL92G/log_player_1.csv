Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how much Bob is willing to pay for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $90 is close enough to my desired amount that it's worth accepting. It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $80."
