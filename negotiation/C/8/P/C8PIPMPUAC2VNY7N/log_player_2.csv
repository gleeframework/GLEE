"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal and will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value of $80.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $90 is closer to his target, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's still room for negotiation, making it worthwhile to reject Alice's offer and continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit too high at $90.  Would you be willing to come down to $87?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer slightly from $85.
* **Fairness:**  $87 is still closer to Alice's value than her offer of $90. 
* **Staying within Budget:**  This offer keeps Bob within his budget while still pushing for a better price."
