"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this truly unique product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insight, and I wouldn't want anyone else to have this opportunity.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $2,250,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal, while also acknowledging the substantial value this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still beyond what I'm able to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and my budget. This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
