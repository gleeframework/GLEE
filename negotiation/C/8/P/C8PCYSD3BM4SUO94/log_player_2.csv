"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both my limit and John's offer. I need to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, or we can call it a day.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay when I have the option of buying from John for $80. I'll try to meet her halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's not your ideal price, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair offer, considering its current market value."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that.  However, $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at this price, I might have to explore other options.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and I'm not willing to pay more than $80. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
