{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above his perceived value of the product ($800,000). We have room to negotiate and apply pressure, especially since we have the backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm selling.  $1,950,000 is already a significant compromise. If we can't agree on this, I'm afraid we're just wasting time, and I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm:**  We're repeating the previous offer to signal that we're serious and won't easily budge. This creates a sense of urgency.
* **Implied Alternative:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob that we have a backup plan (John) without explicitly revealing our hand.
* **Time Pressure:**  Framing the negotiation as potentially ""wasting time"" adds subtle pressure for Bob to make a move."
