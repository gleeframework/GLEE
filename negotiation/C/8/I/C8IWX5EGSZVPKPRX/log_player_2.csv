"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $10,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above your target price. It's better to explore the negotiation further and see if you can get a better deal.  You have 10 rounds, and there's potential for a more advantageous price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and market demand. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's close to your target price and a good compromise. While you could potentially push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $12,000 to John is too high. Accepting Alice's offer is the most reasonable choice."
