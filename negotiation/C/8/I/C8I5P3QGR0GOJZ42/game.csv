,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $78 is just a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to go down to $80.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get what we want.",80.0,Alice,5,
