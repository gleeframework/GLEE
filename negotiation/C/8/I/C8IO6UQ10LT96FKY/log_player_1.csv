Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,500.  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,800. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal before I sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,100. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10100}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $9,500, and I'll also agree to pay within 7 days to give you a bit more certainty. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had a few rounds with Bob, but we're not getting closer. It's getting late in the negotiation process, and while I'd like to get a bit more than $10,000, it's better than risking losing the deal entirely.  John is a reliable buyer, and I can confidently sell to him."
