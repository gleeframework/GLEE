"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500, which is still a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,500.  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,800. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,100. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to make this work!",10100.0,Alice,5,
