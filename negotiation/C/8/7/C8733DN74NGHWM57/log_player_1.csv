"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  While I want to make a deal, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum of $12,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to settle for less than $12,000 unless I'm forced to by the time limit. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm further reducing my offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer in the previous round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $12,000 at this point. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}

I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my minimum by meeting Bob halfway.  I'm hopeful that he'll be willing to accept this compromise.  If not, I may have to sell to John."
