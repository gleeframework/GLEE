(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of possibility considering my budget. I'm aiming to establish a lower starting point for the negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. There are still several rounds remaining, and I want to explore all options before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still within my budget and represents a significant reduction from Alice's last offer. This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm not desperate to buy the product and still have several rounds left to negotiate. I'll try to squeeze out a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly to show continued interest in the product. $10,750 is still within my budget and closer to Alice's last offer, potentially signaling that I'm ready to close the deal. This counteroffer could be a good starting point for a final negotiation round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point, and we've only got 3 rounds left. It's not guaranteed that Alice will accept my next counteroffer.

Considering I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, I'm choosing to take that route.  It's a safer option that ensures I get the product within my budget and doesn't risk the negotiation falling apart."
