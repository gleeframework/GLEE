"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is far too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to accept such an inflated price.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to $80 to make it work."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Politely Rejects:** It acknowledges Alice's offer without being aggressive.
* **Anchors Low:** By starting at $80, we're aiming for a price well below our $100 maximum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Shows Interest:**  We don't want to lowball so much that Alice walks away. Stating our interest keeps the conversation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $110 is still more than we're willing to pay. We're better off seeing if we can negotiate further.  We have a good buffer between her offer and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer works:

* **Acknowledges Progress:** We want Alice to feel like the negotiation is moving forward.
* **Compromise, Not Capitulation:**  We're not jumping straight to our $100 maximum; we want to see if we can get a better deal. 
* **Clear and Firm:** This offer gives Alice a concrete number to consider and shows we're serious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really want to make this deal happen, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could try to push for $100, Alice is signaling that $105 is her bottom line. Accepting this offer gets us the product for $5 less than John's price, which is a good deal. There's always a chance Alice might have gone lower, but there's also the risk she walks away if we push too hard."
