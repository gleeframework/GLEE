"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $9,250 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering our both valuations. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay $9,000, we can finalize the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $9,100, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay $9,100, we can finalize the deal today.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last attempt to get closer to my valuation. I'll meet you at $9,150, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to pay $9,150, we can finalize the deal today.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's final offer is a slight improvement, you've reached a point where continued negotiation is unlikely to yield a price lower than $9,000. You're running out of time, and John's offer, while more expensive, guarantees you the product within the allotted rounds."
