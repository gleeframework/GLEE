"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,062,500. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to both walk away happy.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, so I'll meet you at $1,070,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
