"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is a good fit, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
