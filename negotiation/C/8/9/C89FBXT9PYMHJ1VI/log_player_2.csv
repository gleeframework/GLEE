"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's asking price. While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's willingness to go lower. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** The goal is to get the product for as close to your maximum budget ($100) as possible.  
* **John as Backup:**  Remember, you always have the option of buying from John for $100 if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $110? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $110 is closer to your budget, but still exceeds it.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since your maximum budget is only $10 difference from her current offer. 
* **John as Backup:** It's good to keep in mind you have the option of buying from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm trying to keep it closer to $90. Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price within your budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** By suggesting $90, you're gauging if Alice is open to a price closer to your limit.  
* **Alternative Ready:**  Remember, you can always fall back on buying from John for $100 if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **At the Limit:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105.
* **John's Price is Better:** You can get the product for $100 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer. 
* **No Guarantee of Further Discount:** Even if you counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will agree to a price lower than $105."
