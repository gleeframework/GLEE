"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This product is really high-quality and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, maybe around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible but $75 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we split the difference from my previous offer and go with $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $100 is closer, I'm afraid I can't go that high. My absolute maximum would be $80.  That's all I have budgeted for this.",80.0,Bob,6,
