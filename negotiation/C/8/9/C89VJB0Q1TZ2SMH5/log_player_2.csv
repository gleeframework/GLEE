"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done, and I think this price is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is a good fit for me, but I need a lower price.  How about we settle at $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting significantly below Alice's asking price creates room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Target Price:** My goal is to get the product for under $1,000,000.  Starting at $900,000 gives Alice space to come down while still potentially meeting my needs.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the backup option of buying from John at $1,000,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is moving closer to my range, $1,050,000 is still above my $1,000,000 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have seven rounds left, and Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests I can push for a better price.
* **John as Leverage:** The option to buy from John at $1,000,000 gives me a strong bargaining position."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm stating my maximum price clearly and firmly, which shows Alice I'm serious. It also avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying I'm ""ready to close the deal today,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Leverage Maintained:**  I'm still within my budget and haven't revealed that I have a guaranteed option with John. This preserves my leverage in case Alice rejects my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're willing to pay $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Concession:** Alice's ""small concession"" is still above my maximum budget. Accepting would mean going over my limit.
* **Time for John:** With five rounds remaining, it's becoming clear that Alice might not be willing to meet my price point. It's time to signal that I have other options.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting this offer maintains the possibility of Alice making a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I've found a comparable product elsewhere for $1,000,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I can't justify going any higher. If you're able to match that price, the deal is yours."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  By mentioning I've found the product elsewhere at my target price, I'm introducing competition and increasing the pressure on Alice.
* **Maintaining Honesty (Sort Of):**  While I don't explicitly say I'm buying from John, I'm strongly implying it without being dishonest.
* **Final Offer:** This is essentially my final offer. If Alice doesn't accept, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you've found a comparable product elsewhere, but I'm confident that my product is the best in the market. I'm willing to match the price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the unique features and quality of my product. How about we meet at $1,007,500? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,007,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,007,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is clearly unwilling to meet my $1,000,000 price point. Her latest offer is just a small attempt to get more money, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **No More Time for Games:**  With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking Alice holding firm and running out the clock.
* **Secure the Deal with John:** I have a guaranteed option with John at my target price. It's time to take it and avoid the risk of missing out entirely."
