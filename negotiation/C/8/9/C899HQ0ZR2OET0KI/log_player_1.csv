{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a good midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. It allows for some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'd like to try and get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $117.50? Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```"
