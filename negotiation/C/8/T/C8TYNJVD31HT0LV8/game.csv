"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,375, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for a great product, and I think we can both walk away satisfied.",10375.0,Alice,5,
