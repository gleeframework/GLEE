"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly less than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and leaves space for me to come down a bit if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending under $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, even though it's right at his perceived value.  I need to make more than that to justify selling to him.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price slightly above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also leaves room for further negotiation.  We're still above my minimum, and if Bob rejects again, I'll consider my options more carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to stick to my budget of $10,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between your last offer and my initial request? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counter again in the next round, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John. We're at the point where the risk of not selling to John is becoming greater than the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,375, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for a great product, and I think we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10375}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but still not there. I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially losing out on the deal with John. This offer is meant to be my last stand with Bob, and if he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $10,200 for the product. This is still within my budget and closer to what I was originally hoping for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the risk of not closing the deal with John is outweighing the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to lock in the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
