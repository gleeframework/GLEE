"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $1,150,000?  This gives you a great deal while ensuring I can still make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,125,000.  This compromise will allow us to finalize the deal and ensure both of us are satisfied.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can see you're firm on your price, so I'll offer $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
