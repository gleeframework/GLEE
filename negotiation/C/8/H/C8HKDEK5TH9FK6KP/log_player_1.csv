# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and I risk losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer of $1,280,000 still nets me a decent profit."
