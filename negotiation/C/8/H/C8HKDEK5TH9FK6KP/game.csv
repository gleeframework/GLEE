"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price reflects the product's true value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept that price. My final offer is $1,300,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
