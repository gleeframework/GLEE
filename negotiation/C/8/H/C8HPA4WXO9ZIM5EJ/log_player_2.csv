(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, it's unlikely that Alice will significantly lower her price.  While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's risky.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price lower than John's, and it's within Bob's acceptable range.  There's no guarantee that a final round of negotiation will yield a better result, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk getting nothing."
