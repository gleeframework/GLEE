"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation considering its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price offers a good balance between our positions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand your valuation, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $950,000, which is a significant step closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
