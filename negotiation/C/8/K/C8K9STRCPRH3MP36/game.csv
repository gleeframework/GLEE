"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $14,000 is already a significant discount from the original price. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? ",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase at that price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
