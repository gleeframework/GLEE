**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $14,000 is already a significant discount from the original price. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget of $10,000. You're willing to pay a bit more than that, but $12,000 is still too much. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if you can find a compromise."
