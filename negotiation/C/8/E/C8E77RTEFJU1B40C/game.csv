"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $750,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget concerns.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
