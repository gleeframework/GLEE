"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $750,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. Since my maximum budget is $800,000, I can try to negotiate a lower price and save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product is valuable, but I was hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility on price. I've also kept my message friendly and respectful, emphasizing my interest in the product while making it clear I'm looking for a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still $200,000 away from my ideal price and $100,000 away from her initial offer. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise.  How about we settle at $675,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 675000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I've countered with a price that splits the difference between her current offer ($700,000) and my previous offer ($650,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a significant discount. It's a strong position that might lead to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's a significant saving compared to both John's offer and Alice's initial offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. This offer represents a good balance between getting a discount and securing the product."
