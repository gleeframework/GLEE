Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $100 acts as your safety net.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You're aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Above Your Minimum:** You're ensuring you receive more than John's $100 offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer, and you have some space to negotiate down slightly if needed."
