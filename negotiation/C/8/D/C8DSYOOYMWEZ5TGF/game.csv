"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,000,000.  This is my final offer - let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're a savvy buyer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll be going with John's offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
