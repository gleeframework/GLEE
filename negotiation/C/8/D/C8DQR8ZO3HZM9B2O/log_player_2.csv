"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you at that price, and it's the best deal I can offer right now.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000).
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $200,000 by purchasing from John. Alice's mention of another buyer is likely a negotiation tactic and shouldn't influence your decision since you have a secure alternative."
