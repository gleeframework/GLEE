Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so this offer gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're serious about selling, but not desperate. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of a successful negotiation. If he rejects the offer, you can then adjust based on his counteroffer. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so you're not taking any significant risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below your minimum threshold of $1,200,000, and it's also quite a bit less than your initial offer of $1,100,000. 

By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price. This shows that you are still interested in selling to Bob, but you're also firm in your pricing. It's important to keep in mind that you have a backup option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so you don't need to settle for a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

This counteroffer is a good balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're not giving in easily.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise.
* **It's still above your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate further if needed. 

By meeting halfway, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $1,075,000 is beyond my budget for this purchase. I am willing to pay up to $1,025,000 for your product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your minimum threshold of $1,200,000. It's also below your last counteroffer of $1,075,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a real risk that you'll end up with a price that's not satisfactory. 

At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option. It guarantees you a fair price and avoids the risk of a lengthy negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
