"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Could you consider $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'll meet you at $795,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",795000.0,Alice,5,
