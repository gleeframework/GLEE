"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You're aiming to get the product for $80 or less, and her offer is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $90 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, so I'm offering the product to you for $100. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is closer to your target, you're still aiming for $80 or less.  Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation going and might get Alice closer to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and am prepared to pay $95. This is my final offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $98. This is my final offer, let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. You've made several counteroffers and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $98. While you could continue negotiating, you're approaching the end of your rounds and it's likely Alice won't budge further.  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is within your budget and a better deal."
