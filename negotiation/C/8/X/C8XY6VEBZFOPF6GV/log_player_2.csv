{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. Given my research, I believe a fair starting price for this product is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a reasonable offer that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. It possesses features and capabilities that justify a higher price point. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
