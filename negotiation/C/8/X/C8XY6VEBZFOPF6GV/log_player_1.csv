Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. Given my research, I believe a fair starting price for this product is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a reasonable offer that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.
