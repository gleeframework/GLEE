"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $7,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
