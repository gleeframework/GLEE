Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely he won't go higher. It's better to secure this deal than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer."
