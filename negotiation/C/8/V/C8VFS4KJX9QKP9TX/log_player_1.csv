Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is getting very close to our desired price. Accepting at $1,300,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
