"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers a great return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exceptional value"" and ""great return on investment"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's not entirely transparent about the actual worth to either party.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John (for my minimum) open as leverage. If Bob's counter-offers are too low, I can walk away and take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Continue Negotiating:** There's room for negotiation. I can try to push the price closer to my desired range.
* **Gauge His Seriousness:**  Bob's counter-offer was a significant jump, indicating potential willingness to go higher. 

I'm confident I can secure a better deal with further negotiation without risking losing the sale entirely to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true market worth of what I'm offering. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but not too much to appear desperate.
* **Anchoring:** I'm still anchoring the negotiation above Bob's offer, aiming to shift his perception of a fair price upwards.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Introducing a sense of urgency and finality might push Bob to accept or make a more competitive counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, securing a substantial profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks pushing Bob away.  The increments of his counter-offers suggest he might not be willing to go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further rounds and secures the payment sooner.

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, accepting this offer represents a strong and acceptable outcome."
