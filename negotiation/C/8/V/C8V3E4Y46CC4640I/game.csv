"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true market worth of what I'm offering. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
