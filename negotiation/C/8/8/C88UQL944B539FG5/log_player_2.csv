Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm also considering other options. Let's see if we can get closer to my target price.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly signaling that she's willing to walk away if she doesn't get closer to her desired price. We've hit a stalemate.  It's time to increase the pressure and show we're also willing to walk away."

Round 8

**Reasoning:** We're pushing our luck a bit, but this is a strong tactic to try to get Alice to settle.  We're reiterating our position and implying we might go with John if she doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to consider other options. Let's try $10,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
