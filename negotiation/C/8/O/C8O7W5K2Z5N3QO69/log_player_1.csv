Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree lie between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but leave some room for negotiation to make Bob feel like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start confidently, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value.""
* **High Anchor:** $1,450,000 sets a high starting point within the ZOPA.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** You signal flexibility with ""open to discussing this further,"" which might encourage Bob to counter-offer instead of outright rejecting. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:** Be prepared for Bob to counter with a lower price. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting or walking away to John.
* **Relationship:**  Consider if maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important long-term. If so, you might be a bit more flexible on price."
