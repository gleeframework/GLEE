Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above my minimum value of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's more profitable than selling to John for $100, so I'll accept this offer."
