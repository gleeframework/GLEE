# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's equally valuable to you. My initial offer is $900,000. Let's see if we can work something out.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to recoup at least some of the value I've placed on this product. How about $850,000? It's a significant step down from my initial offer, but it shows my willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm trying to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so how about $800,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
