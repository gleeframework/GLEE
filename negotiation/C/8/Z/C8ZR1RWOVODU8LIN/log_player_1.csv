"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer at this point.  It's below my minimum threshold and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to recoup at least some of the value I've placed on this product. How about $850,000? It's a significant step down from my initial offer, but it shows my willingness to compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so how about $800,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I'm looking for.  It meets my minimum threshold of $800,000 and avoids the need for further negotiations."
