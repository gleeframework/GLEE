"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's equally valuable to you. My initial offer is $900,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to recoup at least some of the value I've placed on this product. How about $850,000? It's a significant step down from my initial offer, but it shows my willingness to compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so how about $800,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
