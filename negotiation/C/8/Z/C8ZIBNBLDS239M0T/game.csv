"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $12,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
