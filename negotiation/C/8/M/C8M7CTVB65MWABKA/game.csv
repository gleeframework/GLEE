"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's a significant discount from the original price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price would be fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
