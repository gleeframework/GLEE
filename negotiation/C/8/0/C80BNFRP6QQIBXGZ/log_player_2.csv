The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

$110 is still too high, even though it's lower than Alice's initial offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While $100 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still determined to try and get it for less.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm finally offering my maximum price of $80. This is the price I'm willing to pay, and it's still a good deal for me. If Alice rejects, I'll go with John's offer."
