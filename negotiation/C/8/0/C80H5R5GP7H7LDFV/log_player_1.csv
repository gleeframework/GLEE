Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation, but also shows I value the product and am not desperate to sell it for a low price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and consider selling to John if the negotiation doesn't progress towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,500 is too low.  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price of $8,000. It's better to sell to John at $8,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob."
