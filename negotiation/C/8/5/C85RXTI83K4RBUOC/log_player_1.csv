"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $850,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $900,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than my target price.  I'm going to try to get closer to $950,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This would give us both a solid outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $910,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it reflects a fair price for both of us.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $910,000 is very close to my target price, I'm hoping to push for just a little bit more. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can get him to meet my counteroffer."
