"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $200 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, and that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can sell the product to you for $125. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's really my final offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110, so I can offer it to you for $117.50. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",117.5,Alice,7,
