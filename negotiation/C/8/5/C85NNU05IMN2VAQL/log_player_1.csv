{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $115.  It's worth more to me than that, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer gives you a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is more than $100, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still above your minimum of $120, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It opens the door for conversation:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to respond, encouraging further negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? That would still give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $105 is a bit too low, but how about $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal value.  Rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, guaranteeing myself a profit."
