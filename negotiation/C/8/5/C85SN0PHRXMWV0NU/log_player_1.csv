Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation rounds because:
    *  I have a safety net with John's offer.
    *  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
    *  Starting at $1,750,000 and gradually lowering my price increases the chances of finding a middle ground.

I will now counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,375,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's latest offer being significantly below my minimum acceptable price, I've decided to sell the product to John. 
* **Reasoning:**
    *  John's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a substantial profit.
    *  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum requirements in the remaining rounds. 
    *  While it's disappointing not to close the deal with Bob, I'm ultimately securing the best possible outcome for myself.

Selling to John ensures I reach my financial goal while minimizing the risk of losing a valuable opportunity in the final rounds."
