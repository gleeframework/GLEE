{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive tone can build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $15,000 allows for a good range of potential counteroffers without immediately risking rejection.
* **Plan B:**  I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still lower than my desired price.**  While it's closer, I'm not yet satisfied.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Plan B:** Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I'd prefer to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer, I'm looking for something closer to my initial offer. How about $14,000? It's a good midpoint that still allows us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing $14,000 as a ""fair midpoint"" to appeal to his sense of reason.
* **Still within my range:**  $14,000 is still above my minimum of $10,000, making it a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** $13,000 is only $1,000 below my initial asking price, and significantly better than my Plan B of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiations with Bob could lead to a lower price, and there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing the negotiation might drag on, and I'm likely getting close to a satisfactory outcome.

**It's a good compromise, and accepting Bob's offer is the best choice for maximizing my profit while minimizing the risk of getting a lower price.**"
