Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 100}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $90 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my target price than what John is offering."
