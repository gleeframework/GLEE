We believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this opportunity. Looking forward to your positive response.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the gesture, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
