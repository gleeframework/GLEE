"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you.  I believe a price of $14,000 is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. Since you have the option to buy from John, rejecting Alice's offer is the better strategy. You can then negotiate with John, or possibly find another seller."
