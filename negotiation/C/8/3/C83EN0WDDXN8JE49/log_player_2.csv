Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is above your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing you have John's offer of $8,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $10,000 is still above my budget, even though she's come down. 
* **More negotiation is needed:** I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's $2,000 over my budget. 
* **John remains a backup:** The fact that John is offering the product for $8,000 provides me with a safety net."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about $9,000? That's a significant step closer to my limit, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $9,500 is still over my budget, though she is getting closer.
* **We're near a deal:**  We're in the final stages of the negotiation, and a deal is within reach.
* **John is still a backup:**  Having John's offer as a safety net gives me the leverage to keep pushing for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a little above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $9,250. It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $9,250, which is $9,375. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $9,375 is still above my budget, and I'm getting a little worried that we're not going to come to an agreement.
* **Limited time:**  We're already in round 7, and I only have 3 rounds left.  
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  I'm confident that I can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with than risk running out of time and paying more."
