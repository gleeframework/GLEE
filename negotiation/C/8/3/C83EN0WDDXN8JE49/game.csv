"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about $9,000? That's a significant step closer to my limit, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a little above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $9,250. It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $9,250, which is $9,375. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",9375.0,Alice,7,
