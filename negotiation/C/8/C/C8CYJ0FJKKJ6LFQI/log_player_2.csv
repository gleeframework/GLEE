"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I would like to propose a price of $18000 for the product.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding your current budget constraints. To accommodate your situation, I am willing to negotiate the price down to $16000 for the product. This still reflects its value and benefits, while making it more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my absolute top limit, considering I have other options."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to set the price for the product at $15750. This price still reflects the product's value and benefits, while being more flexible for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that the negotiations could drag on and he might not be able to reach a lower price.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's the most prudent choice to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
