"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $12,000 to Bob, so this price is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. It's a compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more to Bob.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and we're getting closer to my desired price. At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal. There's no guarantee I can get a better price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a decent sale to John."
