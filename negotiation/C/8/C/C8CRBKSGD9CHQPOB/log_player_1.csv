Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $85 is still a bit low for me, but I want to see if I can get a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $90?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
