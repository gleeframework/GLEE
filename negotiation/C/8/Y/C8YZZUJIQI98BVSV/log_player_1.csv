"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This establishes my starting point and gives me room to negotiate.  I believe that by starting high, I can still get a good price and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desire for a profitable deal. The $1,100,000 price point is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still determined to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000. With only four rounds remaining, I need to act quickly, but I don't want to settle for less if I can help it."

```

While $998,000 is incredibly close to my minimum acceptable value,  I've come this far and I'm determined to reach my goal of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that John will buy the product at that price, so I'm choosing to end negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
