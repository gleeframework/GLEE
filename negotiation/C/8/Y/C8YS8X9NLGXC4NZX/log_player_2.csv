""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about we bring it down to $10,000?"",

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the price I was thinking of selling it to John for, and I'd rather sell it to you if we can agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $12,000. While closer to my ideal price, it's still a significant markup from John's offer of $8,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut my losses and secure the product from John at a much lower price."
