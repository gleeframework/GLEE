"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about we bring it down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $14,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  I'd be willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my limit.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for me. I can do $11,500, and I think that's a very fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. It's a good price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  My absolute best offer is $11,750.  Let me know if that works for you.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the price I was thinking of selling it to John for, and I'd rather sell it to you if we can agree on a price.",12000.0,Alice,9,
