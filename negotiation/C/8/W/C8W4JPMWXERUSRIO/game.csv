"I appreciate the unique value you believe the product holds, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1500000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  While $1200000 is a good offer, it's still below what I believe the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to accept $1400000. This reflects the unique value of this product and would be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, but I still think that's a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1350000. This is the best I can do. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
