Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,250,000. Accepting this offer secures a $250,000 profit, which is a significant gain. It's better to take this guaranteed profit now than risk Bob walking away or continuing to negotiate for a smaller increase in subsequent rounds."
