"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **First offer is key:** I want to see if Bob is even remotely interested at this price point. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds remaining and can still make counteroffers to try and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price point in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $112.50, as I really believe this product will be worth it to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. 
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Moving towards my goal:** This offer is still above my minimum of $120 but gives me a good chance to close the deal if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to get the best price, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I have 6 rounds remaining to try and push Bob higher. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $111, but that's my final offer. This is a truly unique product, and I believe it will be worth more than $111 to you in the long run. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Highlighting the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique qualities and potential value, hoping to make him reconsider.
* **Limited time:** This offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I only have 5 rounds remaining. I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds or move on to John."
