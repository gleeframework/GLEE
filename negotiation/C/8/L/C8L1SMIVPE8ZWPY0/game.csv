"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $112.50, as I really believe this product will be worth it to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get the best price, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $111, but that's my final offer. This is a truly unique product, and I believe it will be worth more than $111 to you in the long run. Let me know your decision.",111.0,Alice,5,
