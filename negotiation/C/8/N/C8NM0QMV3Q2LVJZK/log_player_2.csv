"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above Bob's desired price.** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* **There is room for negotiation.**  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can still buy the product for $10,000. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price.**  The price of $8,800 is only $300 more than Bob's counteroffer, and it's significantly lower than the initial $9,000 offer. 
* **There's a risk in further negotiation.**  While Bob could try to negotiate a lower price, there's a chance Alice might reject his offer again, and the price could go back up.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.** If Bob doesn't like this offer, he can always go to John.

Considering the above factors, accepting Alice's offer at $8,800 seems like the best option for Bob. It allows him to buy the product while still saving $1,200 compared to buying from John."
