Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $12,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, but I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have time for a potential negotiation with Bob. 
* If you need to sell quickly, a price closer to $10,000 with a firmer tone might be more appropriate."
