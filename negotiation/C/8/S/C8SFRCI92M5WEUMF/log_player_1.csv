Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, it's unlikely he'll reach $100. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
