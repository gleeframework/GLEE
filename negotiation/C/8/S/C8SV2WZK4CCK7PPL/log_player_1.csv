Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $9,000, it's too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but still maintains a price that's closer to my initial value of $12,000.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm coming down to $10,500, which is a significant compromise.  It's right at the edge of my minimum and still provides some profit. I hope Bob will finally accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has not been willing to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and the sale will be finalized without any further hassle."
