"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still offers you a significant saving compared to its worth to you, while allowing me a fair return on my investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I can't go lower than $1312500. This represents a substantial discount for you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
