{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable for your business.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle around $850,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $900,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, but I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $900,000 is a good deal,  especially since Bob has made it clear that's his limit. It's  also significantly more than selling to John."
