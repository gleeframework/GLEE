I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,200,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to sell to John for $1,200,000 and guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
