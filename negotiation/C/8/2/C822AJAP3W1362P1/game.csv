"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1150000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1150000 is simply not a viable price for me.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop the price to $1200000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to make a bit of a dent in the price. I'm willing to pay $1180000. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
