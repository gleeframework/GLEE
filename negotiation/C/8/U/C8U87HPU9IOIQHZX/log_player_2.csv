"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a price below its true worth. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $11,500, saving you $500.
* **Buying from John would cost more.**  While you have a backup option with John, it's more expensive."
