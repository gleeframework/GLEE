It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can potentially get a better price from Alice or buy from John for $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to keep costs low, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

It's still worth rejecting Alice's offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or you can buy the product from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I can offer it to you for $1,180,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's still higher than John's price. Since you can get the same product from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's more beneficial to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
