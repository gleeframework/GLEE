Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $100 is a 25% markup from your baseline ($80).  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, but also provides a good profit if he accepts outright.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on potential value to Bob, not just the price, increasing the chances he'll consider it favorably."
