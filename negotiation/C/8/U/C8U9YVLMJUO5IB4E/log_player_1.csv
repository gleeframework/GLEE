"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start with my ideal price. It's worth $1,200,000 to me, and it's worth $1,000,000 to Bob. I know this is aggressive, but I want to see if I can get him to come up to my value. If not, I'm always free to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's closer to my value, but I still have a lot of room to negotiate. If I can get a bit closer to my target price, I might be able to close the deal with Bob. However, if things don't go my way, I can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I want to show him I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to keep my target price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I still think there's room for improvement. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'll be keeping a close eye on how much time I have left and how much John's offer is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,120,000.  This is a smaller step closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm serious about making a deal with him.  We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more before we reach the point where John's offer becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're now in the final rounds, and while I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more out of Bob.  John's offer is tempting, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.  I'll counter again, and if we don't reach a deal quickly, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm making a significant concession, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  I'm hoping he sees the value in closing the deal and accepts.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting down to the wire. Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, but with only two rounds left, the risk of getting a worse offer or not getting an offer at all is too high.  John's offer is guaranteed, and I'm going to take it.  I'd rather get my target price and move on than risk losing out completely."
