"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is still a good price, I believe I can do better with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is another compromise, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds are going by, but I still think there's room for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob is not budging much, and I've only got four rounds left.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,000 is still a good deal and guarantees me a sale."
