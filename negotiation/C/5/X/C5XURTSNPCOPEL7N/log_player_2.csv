Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting close to my ideal price, and it's only $50,000 more than what I could get from John. There's a risk that continuing to negotiate might make Alice walk away, or I could end up paying even more than $1,650,000. At this point, it's in my best interest to accept the offer and secure the product."
