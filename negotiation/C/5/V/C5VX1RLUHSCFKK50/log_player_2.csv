Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's try $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.
