"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer provides space for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's benefits to justify the high price and encourage acceptance. 
 
This strategy aims for a quick sale at a high price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's still room for negotiation before reaching my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer to guide the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This reflects the product's significant value while still offering you a considerable return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Proposing a price directly in the middle can be perceived as fair and might make Bob more receptive.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.

I'm aiming for a price that's favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is still a little too high for my budget. Could you do $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a substantial profit margin, significantly exceeding my minimum price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but the time spent and risk of losing Bob as a buyer might not be worth a small gain. 

It's better to secure a favorable deal now than risk losing the sale altogether by pushing for a marginally higher price."
