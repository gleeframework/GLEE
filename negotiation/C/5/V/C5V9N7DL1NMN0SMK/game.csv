"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the value of the product, I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at a price closer to $800,000.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $837,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",837500.0,Alice,5,
