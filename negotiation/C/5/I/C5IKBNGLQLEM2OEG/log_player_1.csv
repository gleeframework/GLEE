Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $130. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $115 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is negotiating within a reasonable range. Accepting $105 ensures a good profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation falling through."
