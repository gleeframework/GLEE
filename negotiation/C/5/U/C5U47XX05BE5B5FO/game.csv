"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to get this deal done. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away from this deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer: $10200. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9200. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $8000.",9200.0,Bob,10,
