Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer because $80 is lower than my minimum price ($100). I would like to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum price of $100.  Further negotiation might take too many rounds, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $100."
