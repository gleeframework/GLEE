Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1750000?  It's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a substantial discount from my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
