"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $2000000 for it. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, so I'm sure you'll want to act fast.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1750000?  It's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a substantial discount from my initial asking price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to acquire the product within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
