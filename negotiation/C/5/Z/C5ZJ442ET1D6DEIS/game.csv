"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I can do $110, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let me know if that works for you!",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I can do $105, which is a compromise, but I'm hoping we can get a bit closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know if that works for you!",105.0,Alice,5,,
