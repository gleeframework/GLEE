# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, we propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This would give us both a good deal and allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 975000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reduced the price, but $1,025,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and I want to see if we can close the deal at a point that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm getting closer to my target price.  Let's finalize this at $990,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still being within my budget.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 990000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer the product at $1,010,000. This reflects the value of the product while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. We hope this aligns with your budget and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While $1,010,000 is still higher than my ideal price, it's within a reasonable range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be significantly more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer makes sense at this point."
