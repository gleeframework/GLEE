,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,250,000 is a tempting price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about $1,350,000? It's a good compromise that gives us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with that. How about $1,200,000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a good compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on your price. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to budge a little more to $1,275,000. This is a fair offer considering the value you're getting. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to budge, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but no further. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
