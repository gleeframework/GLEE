"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your interest in the product. I've put a lot of thought into its value, and while I understand your position, selling it for $1,200,000 wouldn't be feasible for me.  How about we meet halfway? I propose $1,725,000.",1725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,725,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're definitely getting closer to a number that works for me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,562,500?",1562500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $1,562,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
