"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your response.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of our current discussion, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. This price aligns more closely with your budget while still allowing me to cover my costs and provide a fair profit. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and I look forward to your response.",10000.0,Alice,3,
