"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,100,000 is still below what I need to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good outcome.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.  I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
