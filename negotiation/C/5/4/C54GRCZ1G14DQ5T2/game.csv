"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my best offer, considering I can get it elsewhere for $8000. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact I have other options. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 might still be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value and your previous offers. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still above my budget. I'm  prepared to pay $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good deal for you as well. Let's try to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not ready to accept $9000 just yet. I'm thinking of a price of $10200. It's a compromise that takes into account your previous offers and the product's value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
