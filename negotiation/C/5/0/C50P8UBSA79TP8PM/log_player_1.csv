Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal for me. It's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and closer to my desired price of $100.  Selling to John for $80 would be less profitable, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option."
