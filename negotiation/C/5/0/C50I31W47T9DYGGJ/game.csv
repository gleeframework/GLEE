"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer. How about $825,000? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer.  How about $790,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,
