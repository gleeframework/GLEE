Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a slightly higher price than his perceived value ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still giving him a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, it seems unlikely we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
