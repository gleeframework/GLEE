"Round 1

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of possibility considering my budget. This gives Alice a clear indication that I'm serious about buying the product but am also firm about my price point. It also leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit above my budget.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a lower price. I'm also not too far from my budget at this point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and see if I can close the deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm raising my offer to $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and her latest offer. This shows continued commitment while keeping the price within a comfortable range for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I've already shown my willingness to compromise and am confident I can get a better price. I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds, so there's ample time to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push towards my maximum budget. However, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. By offering $975,000, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while keeping the price within my preferred range. This also gives Alice a smaller gap to close and hopefully encourage a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is the best deal I can get from Alice, and it's the same price as buying from John. I'm happy to accept and close the deal, as there's no guarantee of a better price if I continue negotiating."
