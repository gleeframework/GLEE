Alice's offer:

This reflects the value the product offers you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your eagerness to make a deal, and $750,000 is definitely getting closer. However, I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. Would you consider $900,000? This price still represents a significant benefit for you, and it allows me to proceed with the sale. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and she's trying to frame $900,000 as her ""final offer"".  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000, securing a guaranteed good deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a high risk of failing and might not lead to a significantly better outcome."
