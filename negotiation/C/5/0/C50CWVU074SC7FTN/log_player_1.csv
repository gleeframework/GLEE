{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate but doesn't immediately trigger a ""no."" 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still aiming to get closer to your minimum value.
* **It's a starting point:** It allows the negotiation to begin and gives you space to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider something closer to $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $650,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss.  

Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to a price that is more favorable. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $650,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value the product offers you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Highlighting value:**  I've emphasized the value the product offers Bob to reinforce the price point.
* **Staying firm:**  $850,000 is still a considerable profit for Bob, so it's a strong position to hold while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting would result in a considerable financial loss.

I want to continue negotiating with Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to compromise, which indicates potential for a more favorable deal. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your eagerness to make a deal, and $750,000 is definitely getting closer. However, I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. Would you consider $900,000? This price still represents a significant benefit for you, and it allows me to proceed with the sale. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but reasonable:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum value and closer to my ideal price.

* **Setting a finality:** This counteroffer is presented as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
