"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider something closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $650,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value the product offers you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is fair.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your eagerness to make a deal, and $750,000 is definitely getting closer. However, I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. Would you consider $900,000? This price still represents a significant benefit for you, and it allows me to proceed with the sale. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
