{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent starting point that allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's interested and how he responds to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $15,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a good profit. I believe this price is fair and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $13,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price from Bob.  It's time to close the deal."
