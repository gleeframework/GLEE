Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special discounted price of $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you, even at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) to Bob maximizes potential profit. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob.
* **Strategic Discount:** The discounted price of $11,500 makes the offer more enticing to Bob while still ensuring a significant profit for me. It's a win-win if Bob accepts."
