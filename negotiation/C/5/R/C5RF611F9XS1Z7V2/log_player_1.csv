"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start high, at my minimum acceptable price.  Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so he'll likely counteroffer. This gives us a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to what I want. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still too low for me. I'm going to reject and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer in the next round. There are still a few rounds left and I want to get closer to my minimum goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a good compromise point. It's more than Bob's latest offer, and it's closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer."
