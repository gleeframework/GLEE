"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500. This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering what you're asking.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9200.0,Alice,7,
