Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting in the wings."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000,  there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** The offer starts high to test Bob's willingness to pay and leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

By offering a high price but below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases her chances of getting the best possible deal."
