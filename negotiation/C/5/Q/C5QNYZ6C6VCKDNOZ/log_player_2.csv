"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but this is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's target price of $1,050,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that's still within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John."
