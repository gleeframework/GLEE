"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $1,200,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,100,000? I'm looking to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $1,150,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,150,000 is beyond my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $1,100,000? I'm confident this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
