I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to negotiate."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1 million.
