I'm counteroffering at $14750. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and my minimum price. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $14,750 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm offering $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and both of our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16200. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $16,200 is still above Bob's budget, and he's already made several counteroffers. At this point, it's likely that Alice is not going to budge much further. Buying from John will allow Bob to get the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoid further negotiations."
