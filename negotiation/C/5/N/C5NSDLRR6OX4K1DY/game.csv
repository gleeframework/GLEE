"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000, which is a great deal considering its worth to you is $15000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, given your own valuation.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay $10000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us, given your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I still think we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $11750, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11750 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11000.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can close this deal today. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $11000 just yet. I'm willing to go down to $11500, but that's my final concession. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11000.  It's a fair price for both of us, given your own valuation.  We've come this far, let's close this deal now.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not ready to meet you at $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $11500, which is $11250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,9,
