You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. It's significantly more than your $120 limit and even more than what Alice values the product at. You can definitely get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice will come down."
