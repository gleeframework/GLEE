"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point for exploring what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's so far below my floor. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $12,250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and it's a good compromise. It's also better than selling to John for $12,000."
