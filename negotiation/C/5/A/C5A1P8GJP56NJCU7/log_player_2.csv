"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal $8,000.  He has room to negotiate and should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his target of $8,000.  He's offering a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but not so low that it's immediately rejected.  This shows he's serious about buying but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply not enough. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000. He has room to negotiate further and should try to get a lower price.  He should counter-offer again to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing he's willing to compromise.  By offering $9,500, he's demonstrating his seriousness while also staying within his budget.  This could be a good point for Alice to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and get this transaction finalized.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is closer to his target than previous offers, it's still a bit higher than he'd like to pay. There's still room to negotiate, and he can likely push for a lower price.  He should counter-offer again to see if he can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push for a lower price, offering a compromise that's closer to Alice's offer. This shows his seriousness about buying the product, and the offer is likely to be within Alice's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $9,875 is my final offer.  This is a great price for you, and it gets us both to a mutually agreeable point.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his ideal price with Alice's offer of $9,875, but it's still above his goal. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible and the deal could fall apart. With only a few rounds left, it's more efficient and safer for Bob to go with John's guaranteed $8,000 price. This ensures he gets the product for his target price without risking further negotiations."
