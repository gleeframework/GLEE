"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $875,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $890,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
