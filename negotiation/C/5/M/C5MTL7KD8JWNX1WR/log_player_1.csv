Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially getting you even closer to $150.
* **High but Believable:** While $149 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it doesn't seem entirely unreasonable. This keeps the door open for him to consider it. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
