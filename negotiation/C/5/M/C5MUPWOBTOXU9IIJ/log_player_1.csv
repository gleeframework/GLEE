"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers tremendous value, and I believe $1,200,000 is a fair compromise. This takes into account its potential for you while reflecting its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product represents value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,100,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's always possible negotiations could stall, or Bob might decide against the purchase altogether. Taking this offer guarantees a substantial return."
