"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $80? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
