Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to start at his maximum. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $145 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring Alice gets a good deal if he accepts right away.
* **Considering the Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $150 from John.  This offer ensures that even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still getting a better price than her fallback option."
