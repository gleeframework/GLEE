Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Value-Focused:**  Highlights the product's benefits rather than focusing solely on price.
* **Strong Price:**  Positions the price at a premium while still leaving Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Time Pressure:**  Encourages a quicker decision and discourages Bob from countering too low.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could experiment with different messages and price points based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style."
