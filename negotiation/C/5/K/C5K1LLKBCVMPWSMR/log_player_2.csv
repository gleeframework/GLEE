"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  Since Bob's maximum is $15,000, there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant drop from Alice's $14,000 offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This price is well within Bob's budget and potentially attractive enough for Alice, who values the product at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and forcing him to buy from John at $15,000 is high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's and within his budget."
