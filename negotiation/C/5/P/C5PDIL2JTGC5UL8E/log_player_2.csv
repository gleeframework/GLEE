"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I can do $11,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000, but it's closer to his target.  Since Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, accepting the offer is the best choice. This ensures he gets the product at a lower price than John's offer and avoids further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
