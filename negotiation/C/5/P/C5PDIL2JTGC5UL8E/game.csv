"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I can do $11,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
