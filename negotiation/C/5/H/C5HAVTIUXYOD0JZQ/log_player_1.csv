Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase [Product Name] for a price of $1,250,000. This product has incredible value, and I believe it will be a significant asset to your business. I'm confident this offer will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950000? I believe this would still be a valuable addition to my collection. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price still offers you a great deal on a product with substantial value.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like more, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable value and ensures a successful deal.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
