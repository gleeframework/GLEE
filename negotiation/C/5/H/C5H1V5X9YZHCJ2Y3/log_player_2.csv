"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price or buy it from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit out of my price range, though. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

We're starting with a lower offer to see how much negotiating room we have. This gives us space to potentially meet in the middle while staying below our $100 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but it's still above our ideal budget and what John is offering.  We'll counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're inching closer to our maximum budget while still trying to negotiate a better price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you won't regret it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our ideal price point, which is also the same as John's offer.  There's no point in further negotiation or going with John since we've achieved our goal."
