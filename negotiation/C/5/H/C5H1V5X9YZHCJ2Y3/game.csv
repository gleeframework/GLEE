"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you won't regret it. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
