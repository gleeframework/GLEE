Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will match or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is framed positively but clearly states your asking price. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down slightly, knowing your safety net with John is in place."
