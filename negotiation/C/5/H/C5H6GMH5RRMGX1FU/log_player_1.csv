{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum threshold of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $120. While it's good that he's interested, I can't accept this price and still make a profit. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $110 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum threshold of $120.  It's a risk to keep negotiating, as I might not be able to get a better price, and I could lose Bob entirely.  Accepting his offer will guarantee a sale and a profit."
