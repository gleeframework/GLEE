"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit out of my range right now. I'm really interested in the product, though.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000?  That's my absolute maximum.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $9000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can offer you the product for $10500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if you're interested!",10500.0,Alice,5,
