"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While I'd like to close the deal, accepting his offer would mean a significant loss. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I could maybe do $95.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $95 is still too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110}
