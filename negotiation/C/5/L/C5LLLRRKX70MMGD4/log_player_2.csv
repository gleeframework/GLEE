"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $100, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal from John."
