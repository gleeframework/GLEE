"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's no immediate benefit to accepting. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also establishes a clear negotiation point. I'm leaving room for further negotiation, but still aiming for a substantial saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject and see if I can push for a lower price. I have more rounds to negotiate and there's still a possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than my current budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which reflects a substantial discount for me and hopefully a fair profit for you. I'm confident this is a price that can work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying within my budget. This counteroffer represents a middle ground between our previous positions. I'm hoping that Alice recognizes the value of a deal at this point and accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the potential of this product.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not ready to commit. I have a few more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can get a lower price.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I can do, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $1,275,000. This price represents a significant savings for me while still allowing you a good profit.  I'm confident we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer, but I'm still trying to negotiate a slightly lower price. I'm hoping that Alice is getting tired of the negotiation and will be willing to accept my offer."
