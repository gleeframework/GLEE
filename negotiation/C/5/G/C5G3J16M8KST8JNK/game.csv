"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. If you're not able to go lower than that, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $12,500, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience of a quick sale. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, but I think you'll find it's a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
