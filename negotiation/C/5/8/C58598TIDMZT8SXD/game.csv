"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,500 is still not quite where I need to be.  How about $11,000?  That gives us both a good deal, and keeps the negotiation moving.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,
