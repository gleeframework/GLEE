"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,500 is still not quite where I need to be.  How about $11,000?  That gives us both a good deal, and keeps the negotiation moving."", ""product_price"": 11000}
