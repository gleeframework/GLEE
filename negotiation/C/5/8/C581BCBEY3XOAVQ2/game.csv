"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which is a fair offer considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000? It's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $850,000, which is $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're absolutely right, this product is valuable.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  Would you be willing to settle at $762,500?",762500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative approach, Bob, but I'm not willing to settle at $762,500. I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $800,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
