{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but not too far off.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that benefits both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer matches my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $8,000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. Would it be possible to meet at this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $8,000 offer, and I've already lowered my price. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I can sell to John for the same amount, ensuring a quick and certain transaction."
