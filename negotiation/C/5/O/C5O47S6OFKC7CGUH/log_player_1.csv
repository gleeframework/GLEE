Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000? I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $11,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and a good deal for both of us.  It's also better than selling to John for $15,000, since I can save on any potential costs or effort associated with selling to him.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
