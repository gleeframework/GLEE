You should reject Alice's offer. It's way above your budget. You can get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is $800,000. This is the price I could get from John, so it's my best offer.  Let's see if she's willing to come down to a reasonable price."

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to get her lower with another counteroffer."

I'm going to offer Alice $900,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and her last one, and it's still within my budget. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to sell."

Alice is not budging much, and I'm starting to think this negotiation is going nowhere. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. I can get the product for $800,000, which is my maximum budget."
