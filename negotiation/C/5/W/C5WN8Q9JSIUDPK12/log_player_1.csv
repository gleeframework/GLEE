"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a high starting point but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a small compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and keep negotiating. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price, and I still have several rounds left to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a sign that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith. I'm hopeful that this will be enough to get a deal done, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This is the best option for me at this point, as I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price and don't have to risk further negotiation."
