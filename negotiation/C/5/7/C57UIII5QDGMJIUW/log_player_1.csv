"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's important to remember that John will pay $8,000, so I don't want to settle for less than that.  I'll see if Bob is interested in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I have 8 more rounds, and I want to see if I can push Bob further towards my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing some flexibility while still staying above my minimum price. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would ideally like to get closer to $9,500, we're already in round 4, and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer.  It's better to take the $9,200, as it's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000, and I still have 6 more rounds to potentially negotiate with Bob.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
