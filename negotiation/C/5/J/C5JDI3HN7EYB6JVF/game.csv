"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget, and I believe it reflects the potential value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product offers and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,5,
