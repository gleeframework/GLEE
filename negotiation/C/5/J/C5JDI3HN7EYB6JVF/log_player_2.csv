# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget and is a significant improvement from her previous offer. While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal to John and paying the full $800,000 outweighs the potential benefit of saving an additional $75,000."
