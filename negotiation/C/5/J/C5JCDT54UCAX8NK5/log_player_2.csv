Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $130, and your goal is to buy the product for the best possible price. John offers the product for $120, which meets your needs."
