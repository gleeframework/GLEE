"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  Could you do $160? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $130? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$130 is still too high for me. I'll try to get a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $130 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 110}
