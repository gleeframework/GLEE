"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  Could you do $160? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment at that price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $130? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $130 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",110.0,Bob,6,
