"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $950000 for it.  This price allows for a healthy profit margin for you and a good value for me.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this price still represents a great value for you, while also allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1100000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit and represents a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Bob,4,
