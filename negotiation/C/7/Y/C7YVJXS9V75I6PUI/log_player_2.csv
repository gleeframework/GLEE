"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe this offer reflects the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, and Alice's offer of $13,750 is lower than that, making it a good deal.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away. $13,750 is a fair compromise considering Alice's initial offer.
* **John's Price:** Buying from John would cost $15,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,250."
