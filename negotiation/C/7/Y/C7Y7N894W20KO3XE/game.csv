"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000.",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $825,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves significant room for profit on your end, and it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is closer to what I think the product is worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would ensure both of us walk away with a profitable deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",860000.0,Bob,6,
