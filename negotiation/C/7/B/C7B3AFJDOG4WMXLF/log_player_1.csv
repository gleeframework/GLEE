Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price above my minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can make you an offer of $120 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the interest. I'm willing to go down to $125 for the product. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $122 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $122 is still less than my initial ask, it's close enough and Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate. It's also more than the $100 I could get from John.  Accepting the offer guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiations."
