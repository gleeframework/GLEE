"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1750000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
