"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good deal for Bob, but he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $925,000 is better than $1,200,000, he can still likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $912,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can continue negotiating, the price is getting closer to his maximum and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a higher price is increasing.  At $912,500, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
