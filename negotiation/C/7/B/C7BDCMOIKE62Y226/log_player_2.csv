Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1200000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in an additional exclusive feature that's not included in the standard package.
