"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is generous, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
