"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you! Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8200 is too far below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $8850? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8850.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8850 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7800 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $8500. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I hope you'll see it as a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $8000, so I'd like to propose $8250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $8250 just won't work for me. I've made several concessions already. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $8625. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",8625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm afraid $8625 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8000, which is the price I was willing to pay from the start. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,8,
