"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to the middle ground between my minimum ($800,000) and Bob's potential value ($1,000,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially get closer to my ideal price while still remaining attractive to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and open tone in my message sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** While $900,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push closer to $950,000.
* **Negotiation Power:** Since I have 10 rounds, I have room to continue negotiating. There's no rush to accept a lower offer. 
* **Value to Bob:** Bob's initial willingness to pay $850,000 suggests he values the product enough to potentially go higher.
* **Risk Management:** Selling to John for $800,000 is always an option, but it's the absolute minimum. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing that $925,000 is a fair price for both of us, highlighting the mutual benefit of closing the deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to come up in price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  For now, I'm avoiding selling to John to see if I can secure a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we meet at $920,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my target price of $950,000. It's a significant improvement from his previous offer of $900,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John (or getting a lower counteroffer from Bob) is becoming higher. 
* **Time is Money:**  We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid wasting more time in negotiation. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids any potential delays."
