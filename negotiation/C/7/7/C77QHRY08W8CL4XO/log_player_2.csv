"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds immense value to me, but I understand its true worth to you lies at $10,000. Considering this, I am willing to extend a special offer to you. If you are interested, I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This price not only reflects its high quality and unique features but also offers you a significant saving compared to its intrinsic value to you. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both parties. Please let me know if you wish to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
