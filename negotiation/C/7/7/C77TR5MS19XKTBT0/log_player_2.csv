"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you value the product at. It makes sense to negotiate down, starting well below her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. "",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting lower than your target price. This leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while gauging Alice's flexibility.
* **Significantly Below Asking:** By starting at $6,000, you signal that Alice's initial price is unrealistic for you. This might encourage her to make more significant concessions.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but makes it clear that you have a budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $9,000 remains above your budget of $8,000 and what you believe the product is worth.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to move down to $9,000 suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John is an Option:** You have the safety net of buying from John at $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're moving closer to your limit but still leaving some room for negotiation.  A $1,000 increase on your part shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Market Value Reference:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly introduce the idea that there might be other options available, strengthening your negotiating position without being overly aggressive.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be and how close you are to a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** Alice is getting closer to your budget, but $8,500 is still above what you're willing to pay and what you can get it for from John.
* ** Leverage:** You still have John's offer as a backup, and time is on your side to see if you can get Alice closer to $8,000. 
* **Final Push:** By rejecting this offer, you're signaling to Alice that this is her last chance to make a compelling offer before you consider John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I can offer you $7,500, which I feel is a fair and final offer."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're making it clear that $7,500 is your best offer.  The phrase ""fair and final offer"" adds weight to your stance.
* **Strategic Concession:** A $500 increase from your last offer shows some movement, but not so much that you're nearing your absolute limit.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, you're subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I can offer it to you for $8,200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Her message indicates that $8,000 is her absolute bottom line. 
* **Minimal Savings:**  Even if you could get Alice down slightly in further negotiation (which is unlikely), the potential savings would be minimal compared to John's offer.
* **No Guarantee:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might not result in a better price and could waste valuable time. 

At this point, it makes the most financial sense to go with the sure thing and buy from John at $8,000."
