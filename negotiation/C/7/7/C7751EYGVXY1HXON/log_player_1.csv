Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $100.  This is still a good profit for me, but it's also a compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob will find appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not high enough.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $120, it makes more sense to sell the product to John at this point.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer to a level I'm comfortable with."
