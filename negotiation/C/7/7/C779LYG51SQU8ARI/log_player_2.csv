"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're presenting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's making a significant counteroffer.  $1,200,000 is still above Alice's minimum price, giving her room to negotiate but also creating a clear starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as low a price as possible.  While $1,300,000 is closer to his target, he can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while still staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price in the middle of his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his target.  This strategy should keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
