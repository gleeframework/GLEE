""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the market. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know John provides a safety net at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob initially allows for maximizing potential profit.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $19,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Having a price floor in mind (perhaps $16,000-$17,000) will help you make quick decisions.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While focusing on Bob, remember you have John as a backup option, ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum acceptable price."
