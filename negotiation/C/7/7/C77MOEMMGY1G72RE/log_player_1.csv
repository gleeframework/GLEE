Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I need to make at least $80 to be happy with the sale. 
* **Potential Upsell:**  By offering a price slightly above my minimum, I increase the chance of Bob accepting while still leaving room for negotiation if he counters.
* **Risk Mitigation:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, so there's no downside to offering a slightly higher price."
