"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,4,
