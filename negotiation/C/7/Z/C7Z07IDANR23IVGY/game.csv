"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit out of reach. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My counteroffer is $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
