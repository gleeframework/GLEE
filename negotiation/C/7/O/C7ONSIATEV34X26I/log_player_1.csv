Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I've factored in the fact that Bob values the product at $100.  It gives me a good chance to make a profit while still potentially finding a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept and make a profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum threshold of $150.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $150."
