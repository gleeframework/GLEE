Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?

Round 4

I'm aiming to get as close to $900,000 as possible. Bob increasing his offer is a good sign he's willing to move.  It's still early in the negotiation."
